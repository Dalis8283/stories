        title: "Monday",
        content: "<p>When 14-year-old Zoe Dancer woke up that morning, she was completely unaware of the adventure she will have that week. She was unaware that the relationship with her sister, who she thought hated her, will change, and she was unaware that she would be going places missing something, something she always had.</p><br><br><p>Zoe had awakened in her bed and stretched her arms out with a big yawn as she pushed tiredness from her mind and when her eyes opened, she saw her sister looking at her from her doorway, causing her to blush and her fear began to rise as she worried that her sister might say something to her. Surprisingly, Tracy, her sister, chose not to speak, preferring to turn and leave. Zoe grabbed the clothes she had laid out the night before and walked to the bathroom, where she stripped out of her pajamas and placed them beside her normal clothes before she went into the tub for her shower.</p><br><br><p>Unfortunately, because of Zoe's condition with her right leg, she tries not to spend too long standing in the shower, just enough to get decently washed before coming out to sit over the covered toilet. This allowed her to rest her feet and get herself dry from the shower before getting dressed. ‶Zoe! Breakfast is ready!‶ Her mother called, which had distracted her from the daydream she was starting to have about her crush Brooke, who was the best friend of her sister, and thus likely wouldn't have been as interested in her due to her sister's perceived hatred.</p><br><br><p>Zoe got up like she always did, using her left foot, then placed weight on her right and walked out and followed the tunnel to the dining room where a plate of three waffles covered in the orange jam was placed before her, followed by a glass of milk and two slices of cheese. Her sister looked at Zoe as she came in and then sat at her spot at the table just as their mother (Nicole) joined the girls. Sitting between her daughters, she looked at both of them before she began eating, though when Zoe noticed Tracy looking at her, she looked down with a blush on her face, and the mother and eldest daughter frowned with concern over the youngest member of the family.</p><br><br><p>The older woman knew she was shy, and they thought perhaps she was bothered at being stared at. A ping sound of a cell phone message activated and Nicole picked up her cell and smiled. ‶Mama Kelly wanted me to tell you two good mornings! And that she hoped you both will have a good day today. ‶Nicole said and Zoe was the first to look at her mother and smile a cute, sweet smile ‶Tell her I hope she has a good day too!‶ ‶Tell her to stay away from sleazy Joe‶ Tracy added as they knew well their other mother, Kelly liked dealing and Joe an acquaintance always had the sleaziest deals that bordered on illegal.</p><br><br><p>Nicole simply laughed and sent a rapid message back to her love before the girls ate their food. Of course, Zoe knew that Kelly wasn't out of the house looking for a deal, but at work. Kelly has an early shift, which makes her wake up early. She knew that Kelly will be home by the time school ended, but she'll be asleep (unless, of course, Nicole and Kelly wanted to have fun as only a couple should.) Then their aunt Melody would come to take the teens over to her place for some time. It certainly helped that their aunt was a teacher at the school both girls attended.</p><br><br><p>Today, however, that won't be happening, though tomorrow it will because their house is being fumigated for a bug infestation they seemed to be having.</p><br><br><p>Tracy was the first to finish her breakfast, and she left her mother and younger sister alone as Zoe worked on her second waffle and finally the final waffle before she ate the cheese and washed it all down with the milk. Zoe went to the living room to watch TV as she waited for her mom to get ready for work.</p><br><br><p>To get to school, most students rode the bus, some got to ride in taxicabs, and those who were wheelchair bound rode special para-transit buses. Nicole's job was on the way to their daughter's high school, so she drove them to it.</p><br><br><p>Unfortunately, her work, and their other mother's need to sleep, made it so that Zoe had to take the bus home. Tracy had basketball practice and afterwards she desired to be with her friends.</p><br><br><p>‶Zoe, Tracy! I'm ready, time for school!‶ Nicole said as she called to her daughter, watching TV and then to her eldest daughter, both of whom immediately joined their mother at the door. The girls then went to the car, where Tracy got into the front seat. Zoe entered the back and sat there. As the car went on the road, she used the front seat to shield herself from the blinding light.</p><br><br><p>That was why the back set was better, but also because the seat back there was much more comfortable than the front. But strangely, Tracy didn't seem to realize this, which was surprising, but Nicole never made Tracy sit behind Zoe. In fact, she refused to let Zoe sit in the front.</p><br><br><p>‶So Coach Holmes was proud of my last test score, so I'm not banned from playing,‶ Tracy told her mother. Zoe remembered that Tracy was a basketball player and sometimes wished she could play a sport like basketball. Unfortunately, her condition prevented it. Zoe wasn't supposed to run, and it's unlikely they'd want her standing since she shouldn't be doing that too much either. She looked at her pants, and played with her pocket's cover a little, unaware that Tracy had glanced at her through the mirror at the front of the car.</p><br><br><p>Tracy hadn't mentioned it, but she wished that she could play basketball with her little sister, at least watch her toss the ball into the net. It killed her inside that the medical condition had caused so many problems for her sister.</p><br><br><p>As conversation happened between eldest daughter and mother, the car, (a 2022 Ultrix Chevalier) turned the corners, and continued on its journey to the parking lot of Sir Frederic Banting High School. As Zoe looked, she could see the high green top of the school ahead of her.</p><br><br><p>The car moved closer and closer to the school, and as it did, the girls saw their friends, Zoe's bestie Cecilia Nostorm standing beside her elder sister, Jill, alongside Tracy's friends, Jan McClure, and Brook Alvastein, whom also was a source of affection for Zoe, as she had a crush on her.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe got out of the car, Cecilia ran up and hugged her friend in greeting, before she turned to look at Nicole through the window with a smile. ‶Hi, Mrs. Dancer! Don't worry, Zoe's in good hands, I promise! ‶ Nicole had smiled at Cecilia. She was such a kind, caring girl, and she was pleased that Zoe had made a friend out of her.</p><br><br><p>‶Thanks, Cecilia; I hope you have a good day!‶ Nicole said as Zoe waved farewell to her mother and was gently guided into the High school where they encountered Zoe's aunt. ‶Hi, Miss. Gretchers! -Good morning Aunt Melody!‶ the girls greeted at the same time.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was carefully guided by Cecilia to their first period classroom, where they could settle in. Their first period class was Language Arts for the 9th grade level. Which was taught by a delightfully amazing teacher named Miss Cron.</p><br><br><p>Miss Cron made her class entertaining and fun rather than boring and tedious. As a result, almost every student at the school loved learning from Miss Cron. The bell soon rang and with Zoe and now Cecilia settled in their preferred seats in the second to the front seats of the class, they were ready to begin.</p><br><br><p>Of course, they had to sit through the daily announcements, such as the Girls Basketball team winning the qualifiers for the school's Basketball Season. Then the announcement of the program participants began. Perhaps unlike most times, Sir Frederick Banting High School began with the twelve grades, and made their way down that morning.</p><br><br><p>Zoe didn't hear her sister's name being called, which she knew wouldn't happen anymore since her sister was in the program last year. Brooke's name also wasn't called. When it came time for the 9th graders, she didn't hear Cecilia's name called or her own. Since her name hadn't been called, she didn't think she'd be in the program that week.</p><br><br><p>She heard the name of the 9nth grade boy but thus far, no girl was mentioned. This caused conversation to start behind her as they noticed that a 9th grader girl wasn't asked to go to the office. They knew that 9th graders were included, so they were curious. But Cecilia started looking at Zoe, worry evident on her face as realization hit her friend's mind.</p><br><br><p>The Class continued on until it reached its halfway point, when it happened. The most dreaded words ever to grace the intercom went through.</p><br><br><p><b>ZOE DANCER! PLEASE COME TO THE OFFICE PLEASE!</b></p><br><br><p>Zoe squeaked as her eyes widened. ‶But ... but I have never done anything! ‶Zee...‶ said Cecilia, followed by ‶it's Monday‶ This caused Zoe to blink her eyes ‶so?‶ ‶Think it through, what happens on Monday?‶ Zoe's eyes widened. ‶Oh, no‶ with a look of pure terror, she got out of her seat and walked out the door.</p><br><br><p>Fear gripped her heart as she left the classroom, as she heard people talking and say that's why there was a delay.</p><br><br><p>Ever since a staff meeting before her arrival, the staff were well aware of her condition, and knew that she needed time to sit down since she'd just arrived and had to walk to her class which was upstairs and at the back of the school.</p><br><br><p>Fortunately, she had use of elevators, which she shared with those students and staff who couldn't walk upstairs. So Zoe walked down the hall, pressed the elevator button, and when the elevator doors opened, she walked in, sat on the seat set up for those like her, and felt the weird feeling inside her as the elevator went down.</p><br><br><p>The elevator doors opened and reluctantly she walked out. The young teen didn't want to leave, but she knew that the principal would send people out for her, and if she tried to resist, she thought that would upset the other important people in her life. Unfortunately, she was seen, so trying to escape didn't work and she was guided to the office by a staff member.</p><br><br><p>She'd seen students there, but none of them were naked, which meant they weren't programmed participants. She had heard of students arriving to peep at the naked people. She noticed Tracy had arrived seemingly sweating, but she didn't seem to have problems breathing. But even so, to the 14-year-old, it seemed as if her sister ran as fast as she was able to get there, was it? The other students edged away, almost as if afraid as Zoe was brought into the NIS program office.</p><br><br><p>‶Congrats, Zoe, you're in the program. You just need to complete this week and you don't need to worry.‶ Said the Principal.</p><br><br><p>‶But I don't want to participate!‶ Zoe responded</p><br><br><p>‶I'm sorry, but it's not your choice,‶ the Principal's reply came.</p><br><br><p>One of the staff was gentle with her, carefully guiding her out of her clothes. First her shirt, and then her black bra, followed by the rest of her. Before long, the now crying girl was naked, as her clothes were deposited in a box seemingly with her last name. It seemed like it was used before. That's when she remembered that Tracy was in the program last year, so it was true.</p><br><br><p>‶Come on, time for you to return to your class!‶ Said the Vice Principal</p><br><br><p>‶We need to give her a moment, her condition remember?‶ The Principal reminded them.</p><br><br><p>Zoe no longer listened; instead, she got up and walked out the doors. Her arms came up to hide, but she heard the mean nasally voice of the staff ‶put your arms down! You can't hide yourself.‶ So Zoe reluctantly placed her arms down again as she walked out to the area outside the office. She noticed that the area seemed empty of students save one, her sister. Tracy didn't approach her, not out of the discomfort of being near a naked student, but at how uncomfortable Zoe seemed to be feeling. Zoe squeaked just from brushing another's arms as a staff member passed her.</p><br><br><p>With no choice in getting back her clothes, she made the journey back to her class and her work. She continued to cry as she walked, but as time passed, her sobbing subsided. As her journey took her from the office and the foyer, she approached the elevator, and as she did, she passed a large reflective wall feature, like a giant mirror. This allowed her to see behind her and also see that her sister was following her. Tracy seemed to have divided her attention between her cell phone and Zoe herself. Zoe's anxiety started to rise, and she sped up her movement, and dipped into the elevator she used to get down to the main floor.</p><br><br><p>She quickly pushed the door close button, as well as the floor button, to allow her to use the elevator alone. Zoe settled into a seat for the journey up to the second floor, where her class and all those who could see her were.</p><br><br><p>As the elevator traveled up, her mind began processing that just because shed closed the doors on her sister, didn't mean that she wouldn't make it up before her.</p><br><br><p>But as the doors opened, she hadn't spotted her elder sister, and moved out to head back to her class. Zoe did get the feeling that she was being watched as she did, but she assumed that it was the students, not her sister, watching from afar until she got to her class.</p><br><br><p>Having been feeling numb and scared, she didn't respond to her bestie, Cecilia asking her if she was alright. It was evident that she'd been crying, and as she moved to her seat, there was something else that was noticed. Zoe hadn't had a towel with her, so Cecilia draped her jacket onto her seat, so that Zoe could sit.</p><br><br><p>The Jacket was warm and soft for her butt, legs and anything else touching it and it helped to distract her from her naked predicament.</p><br><br><p>Zoe continued to be silent as she tried to focus on her work. As the class was Language Arts, her work comprised putting periods at the ends of her sentences and commas where they should be, or at least where she thought they should be. Unfortunately, her predicament was upsetting to her. Though she had the jacket to sit on, and it caused her seat to be warm, there was something else she was feeling.</p><br><br><p>Vulnerability, She recalled the story ‶The naked girl‶ by online Author Bridget, in it the character felt as if they were someone inferior to the other clothed people. She thought it had been true because she didn't feel empowered or horny as some have said they'd feel, but felt she was inferior to those around her, including her friend.</p><br><br><p>Her friend, on the other hand, didn't feel the same way as Zoe had. She didn't care that Zoé was naked and already she was pulling silly faces at her, keeping her attention until Zoe smiled and then laughed at her best friend's silliness. She felt cheered up, but another thought come to her mind, and this caused her renewed fear. The teen felt fear because of the unreasonable requests that would surely come the moment she left the class. She heard stories of students being accosted and demands that they fulfill some bizarre request.</p><br><br><p>Seeing that something new was bothering her, Cecilia tapped her shoulder and whispered into her friend's ear. ‶Zee, need another dose of silly face?‶ This caused Zoe to smile at her kind friend and shook her head. ‶no ... I hope I'll be ok,‶ she said to Cecilia and went back to work on her class assignment until the bell rang.</p><br><br><p>Zoe took a deep breath and walked with Cecilia out of the class, and as they did, they heard the beginning of a conversation behind them.</p><br><br><p>‶Are you gonna ask for a reasonable request?‶ said a Curious Boy.</p><br><br><p>‶Hell no, I don't want to die! ‶ Said Coward Boy.</p><br><br><p>‶Remember what we heard happened to that one guy?‶ said Curious Boy 2.</p><br><br><p>‶Yeah, but he tried to-mmmf!‶ said Boy 3.</p><br><br><p>‶Shh!‶ said Paranoid Boy.</p><br><br><p>‶I don't want to get stabbed!‶ said Coward Boy.</p><br><br><p>‶shh!!‶ said the Paranoid Boy</p><br><br><p>Zoe didn't understand what they were talking about. The principal and their aunt assured the Dancer Girls that the High school was safe. No one had gotten stabbed at the school since it opened in 1942. Zoe knew the High School was named after a great man. Sir Frederick Banting whom, co-developed Insulin for those who suffered from diabetes, mostly type 1 Diabetics and as a result thousands, if not billions of humans, owed their lives to him and his partner in the development, Doctor Charles Best.</p><br><br><p>Sir Frederick Banting was also a generous man who shared his money with his partner and as a result, the school at large tried to follow his example. As the result of this, there had never been any bullying at the school.</p><br><br><p>On leaving the class, the girls found they did not ask Zoe for any requests. Zoe figured it was because there were older and just as good participants to bother.</p><br><br><p>Zoe leaned against Cecilia, which allowed her to lift some of her weight off of her right leg. This allowed for a longer walking period to get to her next class, which was a mass class with her aunt. Like most, math after additions and subtractions weren't her strong suit. Multiplications were close but not quite easy for her, and division was impossible to do without extra help.</p><br><br><p>If there was concern that her aunt was going too easy on her, or simply passing her with straight A's without looking, her marks in the class proved otherwise. Zoe gets C's in the class and thus was doing adequately. Aunt Melody asked Zoe if she needed relief, as was required, but Zoe just squeaked and stuttered with a deep blush on her cheeks. She knew she wasn't asking if she wanted to get dressed, but to relieve her sexual energy. ‶Miss Grechers, um, don't worry, I'll make sure she can focus, and handle any of those related issues,‶ Cecilia said, having noted how embarrassed and uncomfortable with that kind of display Zoe was.</p><br><br><p>Though Zoe seemed to be fine, she didn't feel the arousal, feelings that some have mentioned, though she saw something wet her down there. She just assumed it was because of the environment temperature, like how a classmate she knew always would sweat a lot after entering an area where the temperature in the environment was even a degree below the previous rooms.</p><br><br><p>With that thought in mind, she went on with her math assignment, until she started feeling something down between her legs. She realized it wasn't arousal but rather she needed to use the toilet. This caused her to blush as she raised her hand. ‶Yes, dear, you have a question?‶ her Aunt asked her blushing niece.</p><br><br><p>Zoe looked down as she spoke. ‶May I go to the bathroom?‶ She asked her in an almost murmur. but Melody Gretchers seemed to hear her and nodded. ‶Sure,‶ she said, so Zoe took out her hall pass and her aunt wrote in it, and Zoe made her way towards the bathroom with her hall pass in hand.</p><br><br><p>In normal cases, a girl like Zoe had to enter the boys washroom, and had she been a athlete she'd have to enter the boys change room. But given her condition, the staff decided that she can use the bathroom closest to the classroom she was participating in. So it didn't matter to them whether she entered the boys or the girls.</p><br><br><p>However, she didn't quite make it into the washroom when it happened. As she was at the doors, she started feeling the sensations that water or some kind of liquid dripped on her right and left foot. This caused her to look down, and she realized that she no longer needed the toilet. With her anxiety coming back, her eyes moved their view towards her crotch, which she noticed was glistening and dripping.</p><br><br><p>Because of how distracted, she'd been, she'd peed on herself. Though she wasn't wearing clothes, it still felt embarrassing to her.</p><br><br><p>Zoe turned and looked around, and saw the hall was empty, and she looked behind to the classroom but saw it was dark. The teenager felt relieved that she hadn't been on display when she had her accident, so she completed her journey into the washroom. She caught a glimpse of the urinals, which told her that she had entered the boy's washroom. This caused her to blush as she went to the towel dispenser and removed a towel to dry herself off and used the water to make sure that she was clean so that she didn't smell. With her act down, she left the washroom and returned to class.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe entered and returned to her work, Cecilia noticed that something happened, but because Zoe hadn't been crying, she didn't think she needed to do her silly face routine. Zoe soon heard the subtle sounds of a text being created and then sent. She'd heard the subtle sound of a reply before Cecilia got Zoe's attention and hugged her in addition to her silly face routine. This caused Zoe to smile and giggle a little, though she tried to be quiet so that she didn't disturb the others in their class.</p><br><br><p>Their class was soon finished, and the bell rang for their third period. Cecilia helped her up and, like before, the two walked arm in hand, and side to side as they made their journey to their next class.</p><br><br><p>As they entered their third period class, they saw that their teacher had set up a TV for their classmates to watch as their teacher got prepared for class. According to the note they'd received, the copy machine went on the Fritz and thus things were delayed. The teacher had intended to let their students watch a educational show, but a tech savvy student, had managed to bypass this, and instead put a porn vid on TV. As the result, they exposed Zoe and a few of her classmates to a sexual act.</p><br><br><p>The shock of the images before her didn't make her horny as some might have thought, but rather, it caused her to faint. Fortunately, Cecilia had saved her from a brain injury and she, and other medical skilled student, had worked to bring her back to consciousness.</p><br><br><p>In the few minutes it took to bring her back, their teacher got the class under control, though she'd had help in that regard. When Zoe regained consciousness, she saw Cecilia, and another student, she remembered was Amy. Their Teacher was behind them, and as the three helped Zoe to stand, she saw an odd sight. Her classmates appeared to be fearful, which made her think that because she fainted, they were fearful that they caused that.</p><br><br><p>‶I'm ok, not hurt,‶ she tells them and glanced at the TV that was turned off. ‶Your sister was here‶ Cecilia said, and she heard murmurs of how angry Tracy was, and Zoe couldn't help but wonder if she was mad that Zoe caused an incident that would add to her perceived hatred. ‶Yeah, Tracy didn't like that the boys had put on porn‶ That was Cecilia again, but based on the Teacher's expression, she too didn't like what the group had done.</p><br><br><p>‶Anyway, class,‶ said the Teacher, Mrs. Schitts, catching her student's attention. ‶It appears that the photocopier isn't working until tomorrow, but fortunately, I was asked if we might be able to help the Drama department to set up for the upcoming play. And ... Zoe, would that be a problem? ‶ The teacher asked. Zoe had to think, and she thought of an experiment before she looked at her teacher‶ well, I can't stand for really long periods, but, it's mostly on my right leg, if I'm off it, I think it should be ok.‶ Zoe replied, hoping she was right.</p><br><br><p>Mrs Schitts thought about what her student had said before an idea popped into her mind. She led her class to the Auditorium, where the play was being held. The elderly woman also planned for Zoe to rest her feet on a chair that was raised to a proper height. This allowed Zoe to remain standing while resting her foot. She'd rested it by partly kneeling on the seat as she painted.</p><br><br><p>As the teen worked, movement behind her caused shadows to move, which caught her attention. This caused her to pause enough to look behind her, to see her sister standing there looking right at her. Her shyness caused her to blush and glanced away, hoping to focus on her work.</p><br><br><p>After a while, the shadows shifted and curiosity caused her to look again, and she saw her sister leaving. Though strangely, she glimpsed a frown on her big sister's face as she caught sight of her. Zoe thought of going over to talk to her, but her anxiety and paranoia made her decide against it. The teacher needed them to finish their work here.</p><br><br><p>The Drama club was putting on a play about a knight saving a princess trapped in a castle. They would perform it on Thursday, from what she'd heard the others say. Zoe felt glad she could help them with something simple as putting the decorations up.</p><br><br><p>Cecilia soon rejoined her friend and grinned at her‶ you did an awesome job, Zee!‶ she said as a way of complimenting her naked friend. ‶Thanks,‶ Zoe said as the girls admired her work. ‶Think the Drama Club appreciated our help?‶ she asked Cecilia. ‶Of course, I just know they did!‶ Cecilia said as she stroked Zoe's bare back. ‶Oh, that feels great, thanks!‶ Zoe had said, smiling at Cecilia.</p><br><br><p>Finally, the bell rang, and the girls grinned, ‶Lunchtime!‶ they said at the same time. Zoe, however, remembered she was naked and knew this would be an interesting experience. The two left the Auditorium like before, with Zoe leaning against her friend. A boy went up to them. ‶Hey, I want to shove my fingers in your-‶ he didn't finish his sentence as his face turned white and he squeaked, as he saw something behind Zoe's shoulder and ran off.</p><br><br><p>That was odd, and Zoe shifted in Cecilia's arm to look behind her, but found no one. Further behind her were a small group of football players, but they were either drinking at the fountain or looking at the artwork posted on the walls.</p><br><br><p>She could hear comments about the artwork as she turned back, and with Cecilia's help, they guided her to the cafeteria. Zoe proceeded to sit down, as she usually did, but Cecilia held her, which the action by itself and her next set of words reminded her that she was naked, so once again she needed to sit on Cecilia's jacket. ‶wait! I probably should put my jacket there for you. ‶ Cecilia had said to a deep blushing Zoe.</p><br><br><p>Once Cecilia had, Zoe sat down and waited for her friend to bring their food. ‶Hey, why don't we sit with the other program kids?‶ Cecilia asked as she brought the food over. Zoe shook her head,‶ Nah ... I'm not sure I want to,‶ she said as she attacked her food with gusto, as she was hungry. ‶ok ... What about Tracy? Why don't we sit with our sisters?‶ But again Zoe shook her head ‶no! we ... I can't...‶ She said, then added ‶Tracy hates me‶</p><br><br><p>This admission caused Cecilia to become shocked. ‶ What?!‶ The look on her face had shown her disbelief. ‶I don't ... She doesn't ... Be right back!‶ Cecilia turns and hurried down the long table to where Tracy, Jill, and their friends were sitting. Zoe soon heard a loud WHAT?! And she found she didn't want to stay.</p><br><br><p>As she felt her heart beating rapidly, she grabbed her bag, as well as her juice and mandarin orange, before making her escape. As she made her journey out, she wolfed her orange and drank the juice before entering the halls and walked down them.</p><br><br><p>Her heart pounding caused her fear to grip her and her mind began thinking of the consequences. She didn't know what would happen and her mind began thinking all kinds of things when she was suddenly grabbed and slammed against a locker, and a boy she didn't know was painfully grabbing her right breasts.‶ Hey! You know everyone hates you right, even your sister!‶ He was so mean, she didn't know why he was telling her things she already knew. ‶I know already!‶ her words seemed to distract him, and he let go of her.</p><br><br><p>The distraction was all it took as she got a good front-row viewing of a reenactment of the play Boot to the Head. Though in her case it was sneaker to the head, and she stepped back away. Her eyes witnessed as the shoes connected and saw the bad kid go flying and painfully get slammed into the wall. Her mind did process words. These words sounded like, ‶hey, that was violent, I am aware. I'm gonna take <b>him</b> to the office. Could you check on-hey where did she go?‶</p><br><br><p>As her hero spoke, she'd made her escape dipping down a hallway and soon found herself back in the empty Auditorium and its stage. As she looked around, she'd spotted the piano she'd seen before. She moved to it, and sat down on the seat provided for it. Thinking she hadn't been spotted, she played the piano, thinking of using it as a distraction. As she played, her sniffling that had begun as she arrived soon subsided, and she became distracted from her pain in both her leg and her emotions.</p><br><br><p>Zoe hadn't been taught to play the piano, which showed as she started just pressing random keys. But this changed as she began memorizing what each key sounded like. Eventually, she began creating a new song. Since most songs aren't very long, she slowed her playing to a stop. But then, she heard it. ‶Wow!‶ that hadn't been her voice, and she squeaked a little as she turned.</p><br><br><p>There was her sister, Tracy, standing beside Brook, while behind them, and closer to the front doors she could see both Jan and Jil, as well as her best friend Cecilia.</p><br><br><p>Her heart pounded, and fear filled her, as she tried to ignore the pain in her leg, get up from the seat, and in that action, stepped back. From everyone in the group, she heard ‶Zee wait!‶ but Zoe didn't want to wait. Paranoia, and extreme fear caused her to do what both her doctors and mothers warned her not to do. She ran as fast as her unathletic legs could take her and ran in the opposite direction, away from the girls.</p><br><br><p>‶ZOE!‶ Tracy shouted after her as Zoe hurried away. She heard quickened footsteps following behind her as she crossed through the backstage part of the auditorium. She eventually found herself at the back of the school at a rear concourse, but she tried to keep going. Sweat formed all over her body, and pain suddenly shot up her right leg as it started spasming. This caused her to fall, and because of the sweat on her body, when her body made contact with the hard reflective flooring, she slipped.</p><div id=‶sr‶><p></p><br><br><p>As the spasm began, her vision went black. She never dreams when she goes through a leg spasm like she has. At least, she doesn't recall dreams, as she's completely unconscious. But according to her parents, who kept watch over her as this occurred, they claim it lasted for 2 hours. But as she's grown and matured, the time changed to 1 in a half hour.</p><br><br><p>When she began coming too, she found that she wasn't lying on a hard, cold, dirty floor, but something comfortable.</p><br><br><p>As she came too, she began hearing the conversation, muffled at first, but soon became clear as she went further and further into consciousness.</p><br><br><p>‘So how's Cecilia doing now?‶ Said she didn't yet recognize and started calling girl 1.</p><br><br><p>‶She's upset. She thinks she caused this,‶ said girl 2.</p><br><br><p>‶She's always been shy, but to think that ... it wasn't her fault, I will not blame her,‶ said girl 1, again.</p><br><br><p>‶Damn it, Sunder!‶ said girl 3, </p><br><br><p>‶I don't think I hated anyone more,‶ girl 2</p><br><br><p>‶Yeah‶ girl 1</p><br><br><p>‶He's done trust me, his parents and I warned him, he needs to control himself and behave or he's out, already there have been complaints,‶ Male 1</p><br><br><p>As Zoe finished her mind's ascent to consciousness, she began processing the words, and as they spoke, she realized she recognized their voices. She also noticed that indeed her body was lying on something soft, and her head was lying on something else, a lap it felt like.</p><br><br><p>‶Hey! The spasms seem to be slowing!‶ Familiar girl 2.</p><br><br><p>There was a slight wiggle, as the lap had something else taken from it. ‶An hour and a half, we might be able to get out soon before 5th period ends‶</p><br><br><p>That surprised Zoe, 5th period, so I missed a class?!</p><br><br><p>Her eyes opened a little and a bright light shone on. Then she saw a face that looked closer, causing her to blush, and closed her eyes immediately. There was a giggling sound, then other sounds, as if fingers were making contact. Sign language, she realized, but she pretended to be out, still not realizing her leg was betraying her. She also realized the face looked like Brooke's face, which also made her realize she was using sign language, as Brooke's parents were hearing impaired.</p><br><br><p>She learned of this from a conversation between her sister and their parents, and because Tracy wanted to learn.</p><br><br><p>Zoe soon felt a hand on her arm, a gentle pet a rub more like. It was warm but with some calluses, as if the hands used hard things like a basketball. But it was warm, which made the teenager happy.</p><br><br><p>Eventually the spasming in her leg was finished, but Zoe laid there getting her side rubbed. She found she enjoyed this, but she was also curious about who was rubbing her arm.</p><br><br><p>‶It's over, so shouldn't she be coming too?‶ Male 1.</p><br><br><p>‶she already has, oh see?‶ familiar girl 1</p><br><br><p>Zoe moved her foot and pain shot up her leg, causing her to wince and moan a little. Though she began blushing after and after her embarrassing display, she decided that she might as well open her eyes. Once more light above blinded her. But she was able to get used to it and she was able to see where she was.</p><br><br><p>She saw she was lying on one of the cushioned seating in the middle of the concourse. Cecilia's jacket was under her again, and Brook was sitting on the floor cross-legged, facing her. Seeing Brooke so close to her caused her to blush again and focus her eyes elsewhere. This allowed her to see the trophy case and the reflection.</p><br><br><p>She saw herself lying on her left side, and the leg on which her head lay was Tracy's lap. Tracy was rubbing her arm. Her eyes moved from the trophy case to the others in the area.</p><br><br><p>The Principal was the first person she'd seen standing beside the trophy case. He seemed to be leaning against its side with his arms crossed over his chest. Jill was standing beside him, watching her. Having all four of them watching her like that was causing problems for her shyness. Her head turned down as if that would help to stop them from looking at her.</p><br><br><p>Her right leg twitched a little, causing pain to shoot up it. This reminded her that it will probably be no good until Wednesday. This meant she was stuck there, but even so, she still tried to move so that she could sit up.</p><br><br><p>‶Easy Zee!‶ Tracy said as Zoe began moving, and as Zoe used her hands and left leg to sit up. Tracy tried to help her, before moving her arm that had been rubbing her sister's arm to hold her. Tracy's left arm followed, making it impossible for Zoe to escape even if she wanted to.</p><br><br><p>‶Sis, please stay, we need to talk.‶ Tracy said in a tone of voice that was different from her normal tone. As this happened, Brooke pushed herself from her sitting position on the floor and lightly swatted at her feet. This caused the dust to fall off, before Zoe saw her move to join Jill. This made her feel less crowded.</p><br><br><p>‶The thing with Richard Sunder, the boy who pushed you to the lockers and grabbed your breast, is he likes gas lighting people. He loves seeing the sadness and despair on their faces as he says his bullshit. While it is true that not everyone in the world will like you, but I doubt they'd hate you until you do something and deserve it. I don't hate you, sis, I never ever could.‶ Tracy told her little sister.</p><br><br><p>The revelation that her thoughts were wrong had shocked her. But what was worse was that she felt guilty, too. She couldn't help but think how it must have felt for her sister to hear that Zoe thought Tracy hated her. The teen couldn't help but wonder if it was an act on Tracy's part. Zoe remembered how in the past, where she did something accidentally or someone something a certain way, made her thought the other hated her.</p><br><br><p>Before she could stop herself, Zoe moved off the cushioned bench and found herself on Tracy's lap again. This time it wasn't her head, but her lower half sitting in an upright position and facing her sister.</p><br><br><p>She felt hands around her; first set were Tracy's hands holding her close, and two more pairs. Jill's and Brooke's hands, but Tracy had a good hold over Zoe, so they moved the other pairs, though Brooke eased her legs so that she was comfortable and less in pain.</p><br><br><p>She thought back to the specific incidents and found that the youngest, she could remember was around five years old. She took a deep breath and spoke. ‶I ... I knew or ... Thought I did because when I was five, I remembered you grabbing a doll out of my hand. You looked so angry! And then ... When I was a little older, like seven, eight, or nine I think, there were periods when you didn't want me to come with you when you went to friends' houses. I was lonely and bored, but I got the impression you were embarrassed to have your kid sister to come with and then-‶ Zoe was soon interrupted by the kiss on her cheek by Tracy.</p><br><br><p>This had the effect of distracting her as she started blushing again. ‶Wait, wait, hon. Wait, I'm sorry about the doll incident, I was not mature back then, a few years before you had your first leg spasm, and you were holding one of my dolls, but when you fell you threw it and broke its head off. I think I was worried about that happening again, especially since we didn't know how long it was until it happened again. And the reason for me not letting you come was the same reason. I mean, I want to be able to walk with you and have the two of us talk about funny things, but on the off chance that you might fall between home and friends. Those scared me, and remember? We didn't have two cars and Mama Kelly had to work. ‶ She moved her face to Zoe's shoulder and as she hugged her close, Tracy cried over Zoe's shoulders.</p><br><br><p>‶Wait, we were friends since elementary school when you two transferred, and we had two cars. We could have driven if you'd asked,‶ Brooke said. ‶Our parents were worried about gas and were concerned that they'd have to pay because they felt they would owe your family one,‶ Tracy said and as she spoke, it caused a vibration on Zoe's skin, which felt funny to her. ‶We wouldn't have made you or made you think you owed us,‶ Brooke replied and from Zoe's new view, after turning, she could see Brooke looking at Tracy with a shake of her head.</p><br><br><p>Tracy sighed ‶I'm such an idiot,‶ Brooke smiled at this. ‶Well, yeah, but you're our idiot‶ said with a joking tone.</p><br><br><p>Zoe had chosen not to speak during this, but she did hear footsteps and, from her vantage point, she saw Cecilia arriving with Jan beside her. ‶Hey, Cecilia has her homework. Also, she'd been distracted in class so her teacher said she could leave early if she wanted to.‶ Jan said, ‶and admittedly I was distracted too, so I got out to cope.‶ Jill moved toward her sister, who immediately gave her the homework and got a hug before the three of them returned to the other's side.</p><br><br><p>‶Alright, I am going to head back to the office, I think Zoe's in good hands, and also Tracy, Zoe, and Brooke as far as I am concerned the absence of you three are excused, I will make sure they know to make that in the records. There were extenuating circumstances, after all. I'll also make sure there's a wheelchair for her tomorrow, and I'd recommend its use today too.' The principal said and directed his last statement to Tracy and Zoe.</p><br><br><p>‶No, I'll carry her. I'm doing the same tomorrow too,‶ Tracy said and moved her face off of Zoe's shoulder, and gently moved her to sit on the seats. ‶Be right back, Zoe,‶ she told her and moved to the school store. Zoe watched her go and then looked at the other girls before looking down. ‶Cee, come here,‶ she said after a while, and she could feel Cecilia move onto the seat beside her, and gave her a big hug. ‶Sorry for the trouble!‶ She said to her best friend, who hugged her back. ‶It's my fault, I'm so sorry‶</p><br><br><p>She heard Brooke say, ‶She was aware. Jill was telling us how Cecilia was doing since Tracy asked about her.‶ Zoe just hugged her friend close, no longer caring that she was naked. ‶I'm not certain I like the idea of her carrying Zoe, for liability's sake...‶ The Principal said as he turned and walked away.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe looked towards the store's entrance, she thought about how she was starting a new relationship with her sister. Her thoughts went towards her physio therapy session and how she didn't have to go so much now that she was older. Thought made her realize she could be there to watch her sister play basketball. This thought made her feel excited and giddy.</p><br><br><p>Basketball was a sport that was important to Tracy, and while she wanted to hang with her. She would not force her to make a choice between them.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe waited, she stared at her hands, which rested on her legs. She heard Jill's voice starting to speak, so Zoe looked up at her. ‶I'll be right back‶ Jill went somewhere Zoe didn't see and Cecilia moved so that she was sitting beside her. She felt an arm move around her as Cecilia got close to her. Then the cell phone came out and Cecilia began showing Zoe some adorable cat videos.</p><br><br><p>Zoe loved seeing cat videos, especially ones with kittens on them, so she got distracted. Though not for long as the Store doors soon opened, and Tracy returned carrying two bottles of water. At the sight of the bottles, Zoe began feeling thirsty, and it seemed that Tracy knew she would be. Tracy opened a bottle and placed a straw in before handing it to her sister.‶You haven't drunk water in almost two hours so I wanted to get you this,‶ Tracy said, showing how she loved and cared for her sister.</p><br><br><p>Movement along with creaking announced the return of Jill, who appeared angry. ‶Some ass just broke her box and stole her clothes,‶ she reported back, causing Zoe to cry and Cecilia to hug her tighter. ‶How much money do you have?‶ Tracy asked Jill, Jan, and Brooke. The three girls began searching their purses and pockets. Zoe knew immediately what Tracy planned. She hoped to get something for Zoe to wear home, but Tracy knew Zoe disliked descriptive clothes. These were clothes that had no pictures of any kind or words. Unfortunately, the school store likely had all of those in spades.</p><br><br><p>Guilt about them having to give away their money weighed on Zoe's heart. She knew the girls other than Jill were hoping to save for cars. She thought they were really kind to be concerned about her. ‶Wait! stop ... it's ... It's ok‶ Zoe said, and as she saw Tracy's feet approaching her, she continued speaking. ‶I don't want you to waste money on things you won't get to wear,‶ Zoe finished before Tracy spoke.</p><br><br><p>‶You know what that means, hon?‶ Tracy asked and in response, Zoe nodded. Tracy frowned again and placed her hand on Zoe's shoulders. ‶Alright, I think I can fit everyone in my SUV, though maybe some laps may need sitting on,‶ Jill said to the group at large. Tracy nodded‶ fine with me.‶ And Brooke nodded‶ Zoe can sit on my lap since Tracy will be giving her a piggyback ride. ‶ That caused Zoe to blush, since Brooke was her crush.</p><br><br><p>‶Actually,‶ Jill said, ‶the Principal mentioned she probably should use a wheelchair as we get to the car. He's worried about her falling, and he's also worried about causing damage to her leg as you're carrying her. As Jill spoke, Zoe finished her water bottle and handed it back to Tracy, who used her basketball skills to toss it to a far garbage can. That surprised her, and she couldn't help but react verbally. ‶Whoa!‶ she exclaimed, as she turned her head to look at her sister with a grin on her face. Tracy grinned back and then took out her cell phone, and created a conference call with their parents.</p><br><br><p>‶Honey? What's up?‶ Kelly asked with a yawn. ‶Kelly? Tracy, did something happen?‶ Nicole asked.‶Yeah, Zoe's in the program is first off, but she had a leg spasm again, she's ok, she's here beside me now-‶ Tracy replied but was soon interrupted.</p><br><br><p>‶Hi mommies!‶ Zoe had added in. ‶Oh, dear! I don't know if I can get there to pick her up. My boss wants me to work an hour later than normal. I'm sorry!‶</p><br><br><p>‶It's ok honey, I can come to pick Zoe up if you need me to,‶ Kelly said, though both Dancer Teens knew she wouldn't have had enough sleep but she would indeed drive if she had to.</p><br><br><p>‶Nah, it's ok, to be honest, I'd like to spend more time with Zoe, so we're bringing her along so we're going to be until at least after supper,‶ Tracy said and then began moving away from Zoe ‶by the way, some ass stole her clothes‶ She was saying as she moved away but she couldn't hear anything more.</p><br><br><p>Zoe stared at her feet again as she waited for her sister to finish her call, but she soon heard running feet causing her to look behind her. It appeared to the young girl that her aunt Melody was breaking the rules in running in the halls. ‶Sweetie! I heard you're awake now. Are you ok?' she asked of her niece as she knelt in front of her.</p><br><br><p>‶My leg hurts, but I'm ok Aunt Melody! Tracy and the others have been looking after me. Tracy's talking to our parents,‶ she said to her aunt and gave her a smile to show she was ok despite her leg hurting. Melody smiled back and kissed her niece on the forehead. ‶Ok sweetie, though I'm sure your moms will say to be careful, right?‶ Melody asked.</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded and turned her head as she spotted Tracy's return. ‶Hello Aunt Melody, I see you got the message then, and I heard Zoe telling you about our trip,‶ Tracy replied as she sat down beside Zoe. ‶Moms said that Zoe is not to leave my sight, which is easily done since I won't be leaving her side for the rest of today. She'll have to use a wheelchair tomorrow too looks like.</p><br><br><p>Mara nodded her head as she spoke to her nieces. ‶As long as you all have fun and are safe, it's fine with me. Oh, and the principal wanted me...‶ she said and fished in her purse before taking a card out. ‶To give you this,‶ she said, handing it over.</p><br><br><p>‶Ah, that's the Outreach card! I remembered that from last year. ‶ Tracy said and turns to Zoe,‶ this will keep the police from arresting you for indecent exposure, but also proves that you're in the program. They will be able to scan it and it will show your cute face on their scanners.‶ Tracy explained and placed the card in her purse. ‶I'll keep it since we might keep the backpacks in the car when we go to have fun and go eat‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded‶ ok! ‶ She said then looked at her auntie ‶hey Aunt Melody, do you want to come with us?' she asked, but Melody shook her head‶ no, sorry sweetie, I have work to mark, and I want to check on the school's photocopier, it's apparently been on the Fritz, and causing problems for some teachers. I'll be home around 7. I'll be there to help you two if you need it,‶ she told her nieces. ‶Oh, by the way, Zoe, Mister Hist said that you'll be in his History class next semester, he mentioned a potential chance for you to get an A, in his class by imagining what it might be like to live in the Paleolithic Period using your time as a program participant.‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy fake sniffled as she began acting all dramatically. ‶My little sister is so amazing that she gets straight As before she even joins a history class. I'm so proud! ‶She said as the others smiled or laughed.</p><br><br><p>Even Melody laughed at Tracy's antics. As Melody checked her watch, she stood up again and moved back. ‶Well, I should get back to it. Oh, by the way, speaking of As, I'm proud of both you, and Cecilia, you got good marks on the assignment you two turned in.‶She said before Tracy and Jill both exclaimed in unison ‶that's my girl!‶</p><br><br><p>It was clear the big sisters were proud of their little sisters. Jill pushed the wheelchair closer to Zoe, before Tracy and Brooke helped her into it. With Zoe now secured in the seat, they were ready to go.</p><br><br><p>Zoe saw Cecilia retrieving her jacket before catching up to watch beside her elder sister, Jill. The two Nostorm sisters moved ahead of the group as Tracy pushed the wheelchair. Zoe shifted in her seat as she saw the doors of the school get bigger and bigger as they approached.</p><br><br><p>The doors squeaked open as Brooke opened them and stepped to the side, as she kept holding the doors for her companions. With her arms on the armrests, Zoe rewarded Brooke with a smile as the two left the school with the others.</p><br><br><p>As they traveled to Jill's car, Zoe couldn't help but speak out loud about her thoughts to her sister about her day so far. ‶It felt like I didn't belong when I had to get naked. It was like I was nothing and everyone was better,‶ Zoe told her sister, and her words seemed to affect the other girls. From over Tracy's shoulder, she could see them looking at her with a frown on their faces.</p><br><br><p>‶It's normal to feel like you don't belong, especially naked,‶ Tracy said to Zoe. ‶I've felt that too, but it affects people differently, and it's rare for two to feel the same thing. I heard a few wrote they were aroused and horny from the get-go and that they felt like some kind of deity.‶ Tracy added.</p><br><br><p>Zoe blinked her eyes as she processed what she was told, having learned that Tracy felt the same way. She felt pleased that another at least felt something in common with her. She glanced down, as she felt herself leaking, but she didn't think about it much, as she thought it was the effect of temperature once more. Though she did think about Brooke and getting touched by her, which made her realize it might actually arouse her. This caused her to blush as the wheelchair went over a crack, which caused her body to jerk a little.</p><br><br><p>As they arrived at Jill's car, the doors opened and Brooke got into the middle seat. Tracy moved around the wheelchair, and with Brooke's help, Zoe was placed on the seat too, but was gently pulled so that Zoe now sat on her lap. Zoe could feel Brooke's hands sneaking around her underneath her breasts and holding onto her as the others piled into the vehicle.</p><br><br><p>Zoe tried to keep her legs crossed as this happened and they were on their way. She didn't want them to know about the situation below. But she didn't think about how the fluids might be going down even though her legs were closed. Zoe tried to focus on her right leg. She noted how sore it was, but she did see that it hadn't been as bad as a few minutes ago. Perhaps being in the wheelchair helped her body with the recovery process.</p><br><br><p>Zoe looked out the window as she rested on Brooke's lap. They packed the wheelchair in the back, and soon they were on their way. After a while, the vehicle went over the rail tracks. The naked teen could feel her body jiggle, and she could feel the pain in her right leg go up because of this. Brooke held her tighter, as if it would help her with the pain. The hug didn't help her physically, but it did help emotionally.</p><br><br><p>Eventually she saw they were approaching a business called Archies Arcade, and as the vehicle parked, she realized this was the location they were going. Zoe soon found herself in the wheelchair again. She knew Arcades were for teens and kids to hang out in, but because it wasn't yet 3:30, the only teens were the girls.</p><br><br><p>Zoe looked around as Tracy pushed her and tried to figure out what she could try out.</p><br><br><p>Zoe didn't get to think for long as Brooke suddenly spoke. ‶Tracy, bring Zoe over here. I have an idea!‶ They pushed the Wheelchair to join Brooke at what appeared to be a racing game. She saw Brooke was sitting in some kind of seat that was also attached to the game, at the bottom and top of the seat. The only one naked in the group saw that the game was called Turbo Extreme Racing.</p><br><br><p>Her head snapped back towards Brooke as she continued to speak. ‶Put her on my lap here. She can steer and I'll handle the peddles,‶ Zoe thought that might work, especially since the gas seemed to be on the right foot, not the left one.</p><br><br><p>Zoe came down onto Brooke's lap with a bit of an oof‶ sorry Brooke!‶ She said, as she didn't want to hurt Brooke. Brooke just smiled as she once again wrapped her arms around the naked teen and got her foot into position as Tracy placed the correct coin in. As the other girls found what they wanted to do, Tracy watched as Zoe, with Brooke's help, began a race, beating the other cars in the game to the Finish Line.</p><br><br><p>Eventually Tracy moved to the next seat beside Brooke and Zoe and joined the game as another racer. Zoe and Brooke didn't act like bad winners even though Tracy had been defeated soundly. With that win, and his own desire to get out of his office, Archie also took part in a race. But if he thought because he was the owner of the arcade that they'd let him win, he was mistaken.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, the other girls decided they wanted to race against them, and then as 3:30 hit, other teens, including boys, both young kids and teens, found their way. Zoe found it was strangely easy to win against the boys, as they seemed distracted by something. She didn't know what, but she had fun until</p><br><br><p>they decided the group should go because of the growing number of non-group kids. So Zoe found herself back in the Wheelchair again as they returned to the vehicle and went on their way.</p><br><br><p>Thanks to the time spent in the arcade and their drive, they arrived at the restaurant in time for 5:00 and were soon seated, but Tracy and Brooke took Zoe to the washroom. They took Zoe from her wheelchair seat and placed her on the counter. She watched as Brooke fished through her purse and got some things out of it as Tracy leaned against the wall of the cubicles near the sinks.</p><br><br><p>Zoe found herself curious and so she felt she should ask, ‶So ... What's going on? I don't think I need makeup, do I?‶</p><br><br><p>‶No, you're cute enough without it, but I wanted to clean you up a little. ‶ Brooke told Zoe as she got some wet wipes from her purse, and Tracy went to grab some paper towels from the dispenser.</p><br><br><p>Zoe blinked, ‶I'm not clean?‶ She asked, certain that she'd had a good shower in the morning. This worried her a great deal. ‶Sis, Cecilia told me you hadn't been able to get relief for the whole day,‶ Tracy said, which caused Zoe to worry even more. ‶Wait!, no, please! I don't want that, please!!‶ Tracy frowned at the panicked look on Zoe's face. ‶Zee...‶ was uttered in response.</p><br><br><p>Brooke hugged Zoe close. ‶You're scared because you don't know what's going to happen, aren't you?‶ She asked as she looked up at her. Zoe looked at Brooke and nodded‶ yeah, what if I die or something? Or ... or I make a big fool of myself! I don't want that!‶ She said, looking down at Brooke with fear on her face.</p><br><br><p>Brooke smiled kindly at her. ‶You won't die if the person giving you relief is skilled. You'll feel pleasure, really amazing pleasure. And it might distract your body from the soreness. What I'd like to do is dry you up a little down there, and, it might give you relief.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe looked down at her crotch, and she could see she was wet down there. She frowned and closed her eyes‶ ok...‶ she replied.</p><br><br><p>With her eyes closed, she couldn't see, but she could feel what Brooke did, and she felt so much pleasure it was unbelievable. They shoved a cloth into her mouth to keep her from moaning loudly as Brooke worked to deal with the wetness between her legs. After a while, she felt very dry down there, and it seemed that Brooke was done, so she opened her eyes to look at them. Both had kind smiles on their faces and Tracy moved over to hug Zoe close and helped her get back into the wheelchair she was using. ‶I'm so proud of you, sis,‶ she was telling her as they moved Zoe.</p><br><br><p>‶i ... don't know if I still want to go through relief tomorrow, but ... I want someone I know and feel comfortable with...‶ She told her after a while and looked at Brook, who was nodding ‶that's understandable and perfectly fine‶ she said to Zoe, as the young teen got comfortable in her seat. Tracy got behind her, and they moved towards the doors, which were opened to allow the three to exit. ‶I'll talk to Jill, since I think she might want to talk to Cecilia, about helping you tomorrow until Friday.‶ Tracy said as she pushed her sister to where the others were.</p><br><br><p>As they arrived, slices of pizza found their way on their table, which, because of the group's size, was in a crescent-shaped booth. They moved Zoe to the middle so that she could get out of the temporary wheelchair, and Tracy and Cecilia sat on either side of her. Zoe focused on eating the ham and pineapple Cecilia knew she'd want. While around her, the conversation happened between the others.</p><br><br><p>After supper, they went to the bathroom to get cleaned up and returned to Jill's SUV. One by one, the numbers dwindled as Jan was dropped off, then Tracy and Zoe, before the Nostorm sisters. Tracy, desiring to be a wonderful sister, took a moment to help her sister with her homework she struggled with, before Mama Kelly gave Zoe a painkiller that tuckered her out and helped her sleep because of it.</p>"

        title: "Tuesday",
        content: "<p>Much like yesterday, Zoe had roused in her bed and extended her arms out with a loud yawn as she pushed weariness from her mind and when her eyes opened, and once more she saw her sister watching her from her doorway, making her blush.</p><br><br><p>But this time, she spoke to her, as she now knew the truth about their relationship. ‶You watch me wake up?‶ She asked her older sister, who was grinning and walking into the room towards her. ‶Of course I do. You look so adorable waking up!‶ She commented and knelt in front of her sister ‶how's your leg?‶ Tracy asked Zoe as her attention went to it.</p><br><br><p>Zoe's pajamas this time comprised a knee-length shirt and panties that morning, so all Tracy needed to do was lift her shirt and look.</p><br><br><p>Zoe allowed her right leg to move a little and noted the pain she felt. ‶It feels a little sore, but not as bad as yesterday. I think being in the wheelchair helped a bit.‶ She said as Tracy looked at her leg. The girls could see a bruise, but unlike yesterday, it looked lighter than yesterday. ‶That cleared a bit, huh, might be in time for our trip tomorrow,‶ Tracy commented, which caused Zoe to blink ‶our trip?‶</p><br><br><p>This caused Tracy to look up at her and gasped ‶crap, forgot to tell you didn't I? Yeah, I'm going with you on your field trip tomorrow, I more or less stated I would be, and they agreed, the principal and your teacher I mean. ‶ Tracy said before continuing, ‶They thought that having someone that understood your condition would be a good idea, and having someone you'd be comfortable around would be a good idea too, so when we are split into groups, it will be you, me, and Cecilia.‶ Tracy finished her explanation as she turned herself around so that Zoe could get onto her back.</p><br><br><p>‶Remember how Mr. Hist wants you to write about the Paleolithic Period? I figured we could go look at that exhibit since we were going to the museum, could help with your future A!‶ Tracy said, with a smile sounding in her voice as Zoe climbed onto Tracy's back and wrapped her arms around her sister's body.</p><br><br><p>Once Zoe was secured, Tracy stood up, left the bedroom, and walked to the bathroom. ‶By the way, were you playing some kind of sport yesterday?‶ Zoe asked her sister as she rode. ‶No, I had science class.‶ She said before she added, ‶Are you asking because I was sweating? I ran from there to get to the office. Man! I don't think I have ran so fast in my life!‶ She said with a chuckle as they soon set Zoe down on the Toilet, and Tracy began pulling her shirt up.</p><br><br><p>‶What happened to those kids? When I came out, they were gone,‶ Zoe asked as she lifted her arms to make it easier on her sister. ‶Them? I simply suggested they'd have better things to do, and they might want to go away‶ Tracy smiled as she crouched down and took her sister's panties as they slid off.</p><br><br><p>‶You also followed me to the elevators too ... I should have realized when you weren't going to antagonize me, you probably wouldn't be mean. I'm such an idiot!‶ Zoe said and shook her head and felt arms moving around her in a hug.</p><br><br><p>‶You're not an idiot, Zee! I don't want you saying that!‶ Tracy said as she hugged her naked sister close. ‶And yes, I followed you. I wanted to make sure you were safe and when you got into the elevator, I had a feeling you wouldn't be comfortable having me come in, so I didn't. I wanted to hug you and kiss you on the forehead to do something to try to cheer you up, but I decided to leave cheering you up to a professional.‶</p><br><br><p>‶Cecilia,‶ Zoe replied with a smile as she looked up at her grinning sister's face. ‶Yup, Jill mentioned she can cheer up the grumpiest person in the world, but I have a feeling she might have been joking. ‶ Tracy said as Zoe giggled and winced as it caused her right leg to jiggle. ‶Yeah, Cecilia is funny. I think Jill might be right.‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy smiled as she released her sister to take care of business and moved to the cabinet and pulled out an odd contraption that she took to the tub and began turning dials on it, turning it into a chair that Zoe could sit on. ‶For the record, I watched for you upstairs too, and when you went into your class I returned to mine,‶ Tracy added in after finishing the chair set up of the chair.</p><br><br><p>‶I have to admit ... I don't think I have ever heard of someone fainting when they watched a sex scene,‶ Tracy said while trying not to smile. Zoe buried her face in her hands as she blushed. ‶That was so humiliating!‶ Tracy nodded‶ yeah, it probably was,‶ she said verbally agreeing with her sister.</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded after finishing up her business, and then she felt hands on her side as Tracy helped her up and transferred her to the newly set up shower chair, and handed her the shower hose. Tracy soaped the loofah and turned to use it on her sister. Tracy helped her sister with the rest of her showering, then piggyback carried her to the dining room.</p><br><br><p>Having noticed that they weren't returning to her room, Zoe started feeling worried. ‶Wait, shouldn't we go back to my room to get dressed?‶ Zoe asked Tracy, who shook her head before speaking. ‶No, you're in the program, plus with your leg still hurting. It might be hard for you to get dressed and undressed. There's also the fact that our parents said they don't trust the school with your clothes. Don't worry, we've already prepared for this,‶ Tracy said as they entered the dining room, and Zoe could see a large comfy towel on her seat.</p><br><br><p>Hers wasn't the only one covered by a towel, however, as she saw one on Tracy's and Nicole's seat. Kelly didn't have one due to her still sleeping.</p><br><br><p>Nicole was placing plates with their breakfast on the table for the girls to eat. Zoe was shocked to see her mother being naked, like she had been, and when she looked towards Tracy, she was shocked to see her getting naked, too.</p><br><br><p>Zoe saw the effect of her sister's athletic activities had on her sister's body. Her eyes just blinked in shock as both her mother and sister sat there naked as the day they were born. ‶You ... You two are naked like me!‶ Nicole smiled and nodded. ‶Yes we are, while the two of us aren't allowed to be naked when we go, but for right now, we thought we'd be naked, so you wouldn't be uncomfortable.‶ Zoe smiled at their thoughtfulness and felt she appreciated their intentions.</p><br><br><p>Zoe began eating her breakfast and savored the taste of waffles. ‶Oh! I almost forgot, remember you two, we will be going to your aunt Melody's place after school ends, rather than here since we are fumigating the place for the bug and rodent infestation we seem to have. They say that we could come home in the evening, but your other mother and I decided that since it is your aunt's birthday, we will probably stay there. But I will be coming back to allow air to come in.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe paid attention to what her mother was saying before she turned to Tracy. ‶That means we won't have fun like yesterday.‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy nodded her head. ‶well, Jill and Cecilia have family stuff they needed to do so they won't come, and Jan has this personal thing to take care of, and Brooke has band practice, so it's just you and me. I mean, we can still have fun together, of course. But it will just be without them. Oh, speaking of the band, Brooke liked the song you played yesterday. She said you might be a good fit for the band, especially since their piano player is moving away.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe blinked. ‶She ... Does she think I might fit in the band? i ... I don't know ... Maybe, but I'd like to wait until at least this week is done either way...‶ Tracy nodded‶ I figured you'd say that, and they are willing to wait if they need to. But I think it might be fun for you‶</p><br><br><p>With that, the naked women began eating their breakfast and eventually finished. Tracy moved Zoe into the living room so that she could watch TV while Tracy and her mother got ready.</p><br><br><p>Time flew as the naked teen watched cartoon heroes battle incredible odds to save the day. That it surprised her when she saw Tracy return. From the clock she saw it was time to go to school, and she could see her mother arriving too.</p><br><br><p>Tracy picked up her sister and then followed their mother to the car where they made the short travel to the school.</p><br><br><p>As they arrived, they soon saw their friends along with something new, an object that looked like a wheelchair, but it was transparent. Tracy soon transferred Zoe to the new wheelchair, and she took a moment to examine it. She shifted her body to make sure she was comfortable, and Cecilia pulled at the sides, which adjusted the towel she had there. Zoe saw she was pulling on the towel she sat on.</p><br><br><p>‶It's a new chair, made for those students who need it, while participating in the program.‶ Cecilia told her when Zoe glanced over. Tracy moved behind the wheelchair and held onto the handles behind her sister. Cecilia stayed at Zoe's side, and because of this, Tracy's friends, including Cecilia's sister, stood with her too. Zoe saw Jill seemed even happier when she had her arm over Cecilia's shoulder.</p><br><br><p>Zoe relaxed in her seat as they removed the old wheelchair from the car. Brooke had gone to push it, as Tracy and Zoe's mom left them. As they entered the school, Brooke took the old wheelchair to the office for the staff to handle and soon returned to her friends.</p><br><br><p>‶Oh, by the way, did you get the phone call?‶ Brooke asked Zoe. This left Zoe confused. ‶phone call?‶ She asked. ‶Oh, I hadn't told her since we were supposed to wait, but you can tell her, I mean our parents probably were called already on their cells,‶ Tracy replied, and with that Brooke turned to the half of the face over Tracy's shoulder. ‶See, on Thursday around this time, those in our grade have to pick a 9th grader, and that person got to spend the day with them, attending class, and after school, we take the 9th grader on a date, and finish, with dinner and talk about said 9th grader's future, what they want to do when they leave school.‶</p><br><br><p>Brooke explained before Tracy added ‶Normally this would be done with a counselor, the last part I mean, but considering the program, and how some may not want to talk to another person, let alone a man if the student was a naked girl, they thought it was best to talk to a fellow student. ‶ She finished before Jill added while rubbing Cecilia's shoulders ‶and they also want girls to be with girls, but there's a limited number between a student so it might not be possible, I mean, when it was my turn, I went with Dylan Mackle he's a good guy and tried his best but I got the feeling it was hard for him.‶ Jill finished.</p><br><br><p>Brooke was the next to speak ‶So, because the rules also mentioned siblings can't pick siblings, I chose you, Zoe, and Tracy chose Cecilia.‶ Brooke finished off, and Zoe got the impression that she was excited about the time she'll be able to spend with her. The nude teen felt she was excited too, considering she had a crush on Brooke.</p><br><br><p>Zoe couldn't help but think about the week she'll be having. Wednesday she'll be on the field trip with Cecilia and her sister, Thursday she'll be spending time with Brooke, though Friday could be Band Practice if Zoe wanted to, but like she told her sister, she wanted to wait. ‶Oh, just remembered, you ask her about Band?' Brooke asked Tracy nodded ‘Yeah, though it appears she wants to wait until the next week.‶ Brooke nodded with a sympathetic smile. She understood how Zoe probably won't want to be naked in front of the entire band.</p><br><br><p>Zoe soon realized that if the date was a part of a school thing, then that meant she'd have to be naked for that. Zoe blushed and buried her face in her hands. The other girls reacted with confusion, and she'd heard them all simply say ‶huh?‶ before they remembered about the date and the time the two 9th graders would be spending was technically a school activity, meaning for Zoe, it meant she had to be naked.</p><br><br><p>Brooke reached up to softly caress her back, ‶hey, it's ok, I understand, it's about the date right?‶ She asked her, before she added. ‶To be honest, it's kinda now a tradition for me and your family.‶ She said with a joking tone. This caused Zoe to look over at Brooke. ‶Tradition?‶ Zoe asked, as confusion filled her.</p><br><br><p>Brooke nodded, ‶To take a Dancer, I mean a member of your family, but to take them on a date while they were naked, it's starting to become a tradition since I took your sister on a date when she was in the program last year.‶ Zoe couldn't believe she didn't remember that, but then she'd been going to physio then, and she'd been tired out as a result.</p><br><br><p>Suddenly they spotted Sarah, a girl from her fourth-period class, walked down the hall, upset about something. Cecilia called to her, ‶Hey, Sarah! Is something wrong?‶ Sarah looked over. ‶Oh hey Cecilia, yeah, the Princess, and the Hero in our play got sick with Mono. So unless we can get replacements ... The play is canceled, I have an idea for the Princess, I was gonna have a program participant do it, but most of the girls aren't interested and I am not going to ask ‶she who shall not be named‶, so all it's left is ... Zoe here,‶ Sarah said having seen Zoe in the wheelchair.‶ Tracy spoke up, ‶So you want my sister to play the part of the princess?‶ She asked Sarah.</p><br><br><p>Sarah nodded ‶Yeah, she won't have to wear anything but her arms will be tied up, same with her legs, since she's the hostage to be rescued,‶ She said before Brooke started talking,‶ I don't know if I'm worthy to play the princess because I'm a little scared what if something happened‶ Brooke nodded ‶Indeed, if you can guarantee Zoe's safety, then we'll do it, we'll be a part of the play. But if not, then the answer is no, and I am sure Tracy would not allow her to go if I'm not a part of it, either.‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy nodded to confirm that indeed what Brooke was saying was correct. Sarah seemed to understand their reasoning.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was blushing in her wheelchair seat as she heard how protective Brooke was being of her. Sarah nodded her head in understanding. People recognized Tracy's overprotective nature, and Brooke shared this trait. Unfortunately, before they could discuss the play or when it happens, the bell rang for the first period. Tracy pushed her wheelchair bound sister to the elevators and got in when the doors opened, and Cecilia followed Tracy inside.</p><br><br><p>Now on the higher floors, Tracy and, by that extent, Zoe followed Cecilia to the 9th grader's classroom. It was a bit of a shock to see Tracy pushing Zoe in a wheelchair, especially from their teacher, but she ignored them. ‶Which one's the desk you usually sit at?' Tracy asked Zoe, but Cecilia led the way and pointed it out to her. Tracy looked at it, then at the board before she turned and helped Zoe into her seat after the towel was placed on it. ‶Good choice. I'd say this is the Goldilocks zone,‶ she said with a grin.</p><br><br><p>‶Why was she in a wheelchair?‶ Asked Miss Cron. ‶Is it related to what happened yesterday?‶ She added in. Tracy nodded her head before she spoke. ‶Yeah, it is, because of ‘De syndrome', and getting a leg spasm yesterday, her leg is still hurting, and it's not recommended she walk on it, so if she needs to use the toilet or anything, have them contact me, and I'll come to pick her up. I'm in Mr. Harper's Science,‶ Tracy told the teacher. Tracy moved the wheelchair to the side of the door so that it wasn't in the way.</p><br><br><p>‶Actually, it's more, the Second Period with your aunt that she'll need you. ‶ Cecilia mentioned and Tracy nodded, before stepping back. ‶Man, am I pleased she has you for this class, Miss Cron!‶ With that Tracy left, heading off to her class and Zoe went right to work.</p><br><br><p>In this class, they started working through a novel and had to answer questions that were in said novel. Zoe felt confident she could complete the work without concern. Unfortunately, as an itch came to bother her, her hand came down to scratch it, and soon it found its way to her crotch, which gave her some pleasure before she realized what she was doing.</p><br><br><p>Zoe had removed her hand, hoping no one noticed, but someone had Cecilia and the teacher, who simply shook their heads but did nothing to lecture her. She was grateful for this, but she knew she was more embarrassed that they caught her.</p><div id=‶sr‶><p></p><br><br><p>The bell soon rang, and she saw Tracy approaching her desk. ‶How was class?‶ Tracy asked a blushing Zoe. ‶It was fine, nothing happened!‶ causing Cecilia to giggle beside her as</p><br><br><p>Tracy brought over the wheelchair and helped Zoe into it after they replaced the towel. Now that Zoe was in the wheelchair, the three girls made their way to Melody Gretcher's class.</p><br><br><p>A giggling Cecilia was trying to explain what she and their teacher had caught Zoe doing. Tracy just smiled as she pushed Zoe. ‶Sounds like she's discovering things about her lower areas.‶ Cecilia nodded ‶yup!‶ Zoe just blushed throughout the conversation, and finally, they were in their aunt's classroom. ‶Hello girls,‶ Mara said, smiling as she saw her nieces. She didn't seem surprised to see Tracy there.</p><br><br><p>Like before, Tracy got Zoe into her seat, and like before, she turned to their aunt. ‶You already know, about her leg hurting and no chance to make her walk on it, right? I'll be in Mr. Barr's Art class, so if she needs to use the bathroom, have the office contact him and I'll come running over to pick her up.‶ Tracy said, and their aunt nodded. ‶I'm aware, oh! And before I forget, I have a doctor's appointment, and have to leave at 2. Would that be a problem? for you?‶</p><br><br><p>‶Yes, Jill and I can't take them home!‶ Cecilia exclaimed with a worried look on her face, but Tracy shook her head. ‶Nah, won't be an issue.‶ Melody sighed with relief and Tracy soon left the room so she could get on with her class.</p><br><br><p>The Students in the class were working on fractions, which, fortunately, were a little easier than division, at least to Zoe it was. Unfortunately, as Cecilia had predicted, Zoe felt the need to use the toilet, but it wasn't like yesterday. She blushed as she raised her hand.</p><br><br><p>Melody looked up and noticed Zoe's hand, ‶yes, Zoe?‶ ‶I need to go to the bathroom,‶ She said a little quietly but Mara seemed to have heard her and sent a message to Mr. Barr via the office, and a second later, Tracy was back and after transferring her to her wheelchair, they were off to the washroom.</p><br><br><p>Unlike yesterday, Zoe had arrived at the bathroom and Tracy had set her on the toilet before closing the door and holding it closed. ‶So ... what are you doing in Art class?‶ Zoe asked after a few minutes in hopes it distracted her from the activity she was doing. ‶Drawing bowls of fruit,‶ Tracy said as she heard sounds of water hitting the bowl, and the Ker plop of something else. ‶On Friday, since I'm going with you tomorrow, I'll need to draw the image of a naked model. The rest of the class is drawing someone they love very much. I have an idea where I could technically do both.‶ Zoe's head tilted as her eyes blinked. ‶Extra credit? So your boyfriend is gonna be naked in front of you? Oh my,‶ Tracy laughed, ‶Jake wouldn't go for it, but I wasn't actually talking about him. More like you!‶ Zoe blushed behind the door. ‶You remember, right? I don't hate you. I love you very much, and if you're there, I can better protect you.‶ Tracy finished Zoe hadn't responded since she didn't know what to say.</p><br><br><p>Tracy had a feeling she knew why or how it happened that Zoe had thought she hated her. She remembered this kid in her class. When someone does something a certain way or he does, he starts to think that the other person hates them.</p><br><br><p>The thought made her feel bad that she hadn't prevented that in her sister. Tracy soon released her hold on the door, causing it to open because of gravity, and walked in. When she entered the cubicle she pushed the door closed, and then turned the knob to lock the door. Zoe looked up to see her big sister kneeling in front of her. It took Zoe a little while, but she spoke. ‶Would it be helpful if I were your model?‶ She asked her finally. As Tracy nodded her head, her lips curled up into that of a smile. ‶Yeah, it would be really helpful, and I'll get to hang with you. I don't normally get to thanks to basketball and school.‶ Zoe smiled as she heard her sister's desires, though she got the sense that Tracy was feeling bad for excluding her on trips to friends' houses. ‶So, what are we going to do after school?‶ She asked as she took the toilet paper from its thing.</p><br><br><p>Tracy took the toilet paper from her sister's hands, and got right to work. As Tracy cleaned her sister, she spoke of her ideas for their plan. ‶The Arcade, for starters, and Brooke also mentioned a new karaoke place near there I have been wanting to check out. But I remembered yesterday in third, I saw you standing with your leg on the chair. I forgot in all the drama, but I wanted to ask if it was working for you?‶</p><br><br><p>‶Yeah, since my right leg wasn't being used, nothing bad happened to it.‶ Zoe said as Tracy cleaned her. ‶Maybe, when we're at the Arcade, Archie can get a chair for you or something.‶ Tracy commented out loud as she finished up, and standing up. ‶be right back,‶ she told her sister and left the stall to wash her hand before returning with the wheelchair</p><br><br><p>Tracy moved around the wheelchair and helped Zoe transfer to it carefully. ‶Yeah, that could work,‶ Zoe said as Tracy stood up again. The two girls walked out of the bathroom and back to Zoe's classroom. Tracy sat Zoe, back in her seat and as she passed her aunt, however, she spoke to her ‶I might be kidnapping her on Friday in this period‶ Melody just smiled as her class gasped as Tracy left the room.</p><br><br><p>The math class continued as normal after that, allowing Zoe to enter he focused state. Her classmates tried to get her talking about the whole kidnapping thing, but with them getting silence from the program participant caused them to give up. She was pleased by this since she preferred to focus on her class work.</p><br><br><p>This focus on her work paid off for the young teen, as she soon discovered that her sheet was finished. She then looked over it to make sure she had missed nothing. She soon realized that she hadn't, which meant that she would not have math homework tonight.</p><br><br><p>At that moment, the bell rang, and hearing footsteps along with the familiar creaking of the wheelchair caused her head to turn. She smiled as she saw her sister walk towards her and felt she had to report to her sister new information. ‶No math homework,‶ she said with pride in her voice and she saw Tracy grin at her. ‶Awesome but shh! She might give you extra homework!‶</p><br><br><p>Melody laughed, though she knew Tracy was joking. ‶I won't do anything that evil, at least not to an adorable girl like Zoe!‶ Zoe blushed at being called adorable. Melody soon turned her attention to Tracy. ‶The whole kidnapping is for your second period, right? Barr told me that tomorrow you were supposed to be drawing naked models, right? Why Friday?‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy turned to Melody as Cecilia helped Zoe into the wheelchair. ‶Cause I'm going with Zoe tomorrow for her field trip, so Friday I have to catch up. Friday's class is we had to draw someone that we care for, and Zoe fits the bill on both.‶ Tracy explained and Melody smiled and nodded ‶Brilliant idea,‶ she said as she watched Cecilia help Zoe into the wheelchair.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was soon sitting in her wheelchair, and a moment later, she felt her body jerk. ‶Bye Aunt Melody!‶ She said as they left the classroom. She watched as the lights danced over her body as they went to her Third Period with Cecilia beside her. Mrs. Schitts appeared to have been able to copy the sheet they were supposed to work on so as they placed Zoe in her seat, she immediately got to work. In front of her she heard Tracy repeating what she'd said to the other teachers before she left.</p><br><br><p>Her third period was 9th grade science class and they related the worksheets she was working on. Science had always fascinated her, and as a result, she liked the class. She loved learning science, and thought if she hadn't had that condition with her leg, she might be a scientist when she leaves the university. She smiled at the thought of being called Doctor Dancer. Her body shook with silent giggles at the irony of the name. Fortunately, she was able to control herself, with enough time to complete her assignment.</p><br><br><p>The lunch time bell rang, and she spotted her sister walking into the classroom and pushing the wheelchair towards her. Tracy and Cecilia soon helped her into the wheelchair with barely a thought. Soon they were off, leaving the class and on their journey to the lunchroom.</p><br><br><p>As they walked, Cecilia was telling Tracy about Zoe's antics. ‶I see, so you found something funny, Zoe?' Tracy asked her and Zoe smiled ‶Yeah, I was just thinking if I didn't have De Syndrome, I could have been able to become a scientist, and found it funny to be called Doctor Dancer.</p><br><br><p>Tracy smiled as she pushed her sister in the wheelchair. ‶Doctor Dancer sounds like a cool name to have‶ was her only comment as they walked. Some boys approached, but seeing Tracy there, they kept on walking past them. Cecilia led the way to the cafeteria, but unlike yesterday, the 9th graders didn't sit alone. Instead, they sat with their elder sisters and friends of their elder sisters. Cecilia still got Zoe's food, and Tracy paid her back in thanks. It turns out Tracy had been doing this since the younger girls first enrolled in the school. Cecilia had been paying for Zoe's food with her own money, and Tracy paid her back for her kindness.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was quiet as she focused on eating, but around her were conversations, but unlike before, this conversation seemed to be around a specific topic, Zoe herself. Mostly it was about the trip tomorrow, the time she'll be spending with Brooke after tomorrow, and on Friday where she'll spend the second period with her sister, and the play in the afternoon.</p><br><br><p>The conversation also went to band and how Zoe might be interested in joining but would prefer to do so next week when she was no longer naked. Brooke mentioned how happy she was that Zoe was interested, but added that despite band practice happening on Tuesday and Friday, they were told they canceled it this Friday because the teacher had something she needed to do. Though the students could have still come to practice, from the students she'd heard from, almost all wanted to go home early.</p><br><br><p>Brooke also mentioned that Brooke would likely be the only one there, as she enjoyed practicing. This new information allowed Zoe to take the time to think about whether she wanted to stay and practice or go home. She knew she wanted to practice, but if she stayed to do so, she'll have to be naked.</p><br><br><p>She eventually finished her lunch and began wiping her hands with her napkin. When she was done, she turned her attention to her friends and saw most of the other girls were either almost done or done eating. Tracy gathered everyone's trash and took it to the garbage.</p><br><br><p>Then they just sat and talked about teen things, before the bell for her Fourth period rang. Tracy got behind the wheelchair and then began moving her to her class, alongside Cecilia. When they made it inside the room, their teacher, Miss Walkersin, was happy to see Zoe in her class, and once Tracy transplanted her sister into her seat and, of course, gave the now familiar speech about contacting her through the office, Tracy left.</p><br><br><p>Zoe focused on the class work after she handed in the homework they had given her yesterday. Thanks to Tracy's help, she was able to complete it successfully, and she felt confident that the mark she'll get tomorrow in return would be a good one.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was so focused that she barely registered the bell ringing when she felt a hand on her shoulder shaking her. It caused her to look up to see her sister there. ‶Oh! Hi sis, what's up?‶ She asked her. ‶Class is over, it's your 5th period now,‶ a grinning Tracy said as she went into place again. Zoe blushed, but once more moved onto the wheelchair.</p><br><br><p>Zoe realized that as she eased her foot, it didn't seem to hurt as badly as before. She still thought it was best to keep off of it, though. Zoe, Tracy, and Cecilia left Social Science class and went to Zoe's French class. The Dancers were Second-generation immigrants from France, and they had family still back in France, so their mothers thought having their daughters learn would be a good idea.</p><br><br><p>‶Bonjour monsieur Legevre, comment allez-vous cet après-midi?‶ Tracy asked him. The Teacher replied ‶Très bien mademoiselle Dancer! et je vais bien cet après-midi,‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy deposited her sister in her seat, but rather than, say, the familiar speech, but in French. She instead asked if she could stay since she had a spare this period. The teacher agreed, and they got on with their lessons. Tracy had moved to take a seat at the side of the room, and watched silently, and observed the class.</p><br><br><p>[<b>Author's note</b>: I'm not sure if it's done in other schools other than the one I attended, but a Spare period was a period where students didn't have to go to class. They would go to the library to complete homework, or if they had no homework, they could go home early]</p><br><br><p>Zoe had to translate words into French, on one page, and on the next, it was the opposite French words in English. Once she completed those, she had to create phrases, but in French. The teacher allowed his students to create original phrases rather than copy something from the board. But it made things harder since she didn't know what to write. Zoe glanced over at her sister, and suddenly she got an idea, and she began writing the phrase she wanted to write in French. The phrase was ‶My sister Tracy is an amazing basketball player.‶ Zoe grinned to herself and new ideas for phrases popped into her head, so she added those in as well.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, because she was having so much fun, the bell soon rang, signaling that school was over. Tracy walked over to her sister and smiled as she caught a glimpse of the first phrase. Then she helped Zoe into the wheelchair, and made the journey to the back, where they reunited with their friends and said their goodbyes to them. Tracy grabbed a bus pass for herself and her sister before they got on a wheelchair specialised bus.</p><br><br><p>The driver was pretty funny, pretending the bus was an airplane and giving them the usual speeches on the plane. Before, it took them to the arcade.</p><br><br><p>On arrival, they greeted Archie before they went right for the games. The games weren't current ones out, but games that might be considered retro, or old. But they had fun for what seemed like hours, before like yesterday. The two of them left when people began coming, and Tracy didn't want to keep Zoe there as her discomfort grew. They took another bus to a restaurant where they ordered the same thing as yesterday and began eating their food.</p><br><br><p>Since their aunt had her appointment and their mother Nicole won't be home until later. They let their other mother, Kelly, sleep some more, so they thought of going to the movies, but when they checked online, the earliest movie they could see was at 7, so instead they went to a park. Since it was just the two of them, Tracy wanted to push her on the swing.</p><br><br><p>Zoe couldn't help but smile as she swung high up thanks to her sister's push, and she could feel the feelings inside of her. Butterflies, their parents might call them. At times, she'd feel her sister's hand on her back, gently pushing her and causing the naked teen to go up as high as before.</p><br><br><p>Gravity would bring her down with a thrilling fall, before Tracy stopped pushing her and allowed Zoe to swing with the gravity. Her phone's alarm rang, and she knew the two needed to go to their aunt's home. They knew that their mama Nicole will be home soon and their mama Kelly would also be awake. So they took the bus ride to their aunt's home and entered it via a piggyback ride, though Zoe's feet no longer hurt.</p><br><br><p>Melody took them to her bathroom, so that Zoe could get a shower, and then get dressed. Tracy got their homework out to work on. Tracy helped Zoe out with the tough part of Zoe's homework before Nicole called, reminding them that their home was ready for them tomorrow. After that, the girls went to Melody's guest room and slept.</p>"

        title: "Wednesday",
        content: "<p>As Zoe stirred from her sleep, she began feeling something shaking. As her brain awakened from sleep, she realized that someone laughing beside her caused the shaking. Zoe remembered Tracy joined her in bed last night because of how she mentioned not being able to go to a sleepover when she was younger.</p><br><br><p>She thought Tracy might have felt bad or guilty about it, so she came over to sleep. As Zoe became more aware of her surroundings, the first thing she noticed was that her privates, specifically the area around her vagina, were soaked with something odd. Zoe focused on her sister, thinking an accident had occurred, but was far more concerned about her sister laughing.</p><br><br><p>Zoe blinked her eyes at her sister before speaking. ‶What?‶ She couldn't help but ask, but Tracy just giggled, trying not to be loud. ‶Someone had a wet dream! That's so adorable. Was it your first?‶ Tracy asked her little sister.</p><br><br><p>As the young girl processed what her sister had just told her, she began realizing that in her sleep, she had sat on Tracy's thigh. Sitting there, on her sister's lap, the leaking wetness had dripped on her sister's lap.</p><br><br><p>‶Wet dream?' She asked, never having heard such a thing, though, considering what happened between her legs. She thought that must be it. ‶It's a dream, where you are having sex with someone, or they were touching you down there. ‶Tracy replied in a kinder, less teasing tone of voice</p><br><br><p>Zoe realized in a way that was what happened, and she glanced at the clock and saw that in a few minutes she'd have woken up. Tracy noticed it too. ‶Alright, so go to the bathroom and wash, especially down there.‶ then she grabbed a Kleenex and whipped her leg as Zoe walked to the bathroom feeling very pleased that her leg wasn't hurting.</p><br><br><p>Like Friday, she removed her pajamas, specifically her panties, and her shirt went into the laundry. As Zoe stepped into the shower, she was very careful not to get hurt. Though as she did, excitement filled her, but it wasn't the excitement for sex but rather the excitement for the field trip she will undertake today. Though unlike on Monday, she had gotten used to the fact that as a school activity, the field trip meant she'd have to be naked. This was because already she'd gone places outside of the school and home, without clothes on.</p><br><br><p>Zoe recalled feeling that she was lesser than the other students because of the fact she didn't have clothes. But now she'd been to at least two places where they'd gotten a discount because she was naked.</p><br><br><p>Her thoughts continued as she moved out of the shower and onto the toilet to dry off. Zoe recalled how it made her feel special, because the discount meant she helped her sister and friends be able to afford the costs for food.</p><br><br><p>She thought based on her previous feelings and specifically what Tracy had mentioned on the walk to the SUV about it being normal. She wondered if her feeling special now was normal. In all honesty, the fact that she thought her nudity was special alarmed her, so she decided she probably won't ask about it.</p><br><br><p>She heard the door of the bathroom get knocked on three times. This brought her out of her thoughts with a startled gasp. Suddenly she heard Nicole's voice speaking, ‶Hey you ready sweetie?‶ ‶Yeah! Sorry, Mom!‶ Zoe said and hurriedly dried herself off. ‶You're going to be late if you don't hurry!‶ That was their aunt Melody speaking, and Zoe didn't want to be late so she finished and walked out.</p><br><br><p>Nicole hurried into the bathroom, and Zoe followed Melody to the dining area. ‶Alright, what would you like to eat? Last night I made pancakes. Would you like to have some?‶ Melody asked her niece, who smiled and nodded, ‶Yes, please!‶ Zoe said, putting the towel down on the chair and sat on it.</p><br><br><p>Nicole soon arrived, as did Tracy, and both were naked. ‶I know why she is. Why are you two naked?‶ Melody asked ‶We don't want Zoe to feel lonely‶ Tracy responded, ‶Ahh, I see then...‶ Melody soon stripped herself naked and joined them at the table once the pancakes were placed before them.</p><br><br><p>Zoe felt happy that her family members were naked with her. Though loneliness was the feeling she felt, what the young girl had felt stronger was not belonging, but now that all three of her family members were naked, she felt she belonged and was a part of the group.</p><br><br><p>Zoe focused on eating her pancakes, but her mother spoke to her so it distracted her. ‶Are you excited about your trip?‶ Nicole asked, and Zoe nodded. ‶Yup, though it would be a new experience, I think if I think of it like when we went to the arcade or the Diner, it should be fine. Besides, I'll have Tracy with me, and Cecilia.‶ She finished before taking a bite of the pancake.</p><br><br><p>‶I promise to keep her safe,‶ Tracy replied. ‶Oh, you're going to?‶ Nicole asked, but Mara interjected ‶Yes, Tracy will be going too, she told the principal she will, and the principal agreed, thinking it would be good to have another person who understands her condition. He thought that the other students might not understand, or worse, might get distracted, or force her to do their work.‶</p><br><br><p>The conversation went back to silence before Mara spoke. ‶Since me and the girls are going to the same place, mind if I take them to school?‶ She asked her sister who nodded ‶Yeah, sure, thanks, Mara!‶ Mara just smiled and then turned to the girls ‶once you are done, Zoe can watch tv, me and Tracy need to get dressed since we aren't in the program.‶ The younger girls nodded and Zoe finished with her food and drank her milk before taking both the glass and the plate to the dishwasher and moving to the living room to watch tv.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe lounged on the floor, watching the Television, she heard movement, footsteps moving on the hard wooden floor, and the noise of dishes being placed in the dishwasher, then footsteps leaving the room. She watched the Cartoon ‶Esther and the Enchanted Egg‶ She liked the story and smiled at how innocent the character was.</p><br><br><p>She shifted her body up a little so that the cushion she pulled down could go under her head as she waited for her sister and aunt to be ready so that they could go to school and the class trip.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe watched, she felt her excitement and her impatience grow as she waited for the others. She knew she could control herself. Of course, she was a good girl. Tracy finally arrived, now dressed in a simple shirt and pants. She knelt down and tenderly lifted the lounging teen's legs and pushed her own under them so that her legs were resting on her own.</p><br><br><p>After a while, Zoe felt her legs being stroked, causing her to glance down, moving her attention from the show. Tracy snaked her hands under her left leg to massage both legs as Zoe's attention went back to the show.</p><br><br><p>‶Alright girls, time for the field trip!‶ Melody said in an announcement of her arrival. Tracy moved her hands and got herself up before she helped her sister up. Zoe moved to grab her backpack, only to be stopped by her sister. ‶Wait, I don't think you need that. I mean, we are going to be back in the later half of the fifth period, so not a point,‶ Tracy said to her sister.</p><br><br><p>Melody nodded her head,  ‶she has a point, sweetie. From what I have been told, they provide lunch for you, so your moms and I never packed you any.‶</p><br><br><p>The words her aunt and her sister were telling Zoe caused her to blink her eyes. It had felt odd to go without her backpack, but she had left her bag in the car on Monday, and her sister had taken it along with her own. She knew that indeed she wouldn't be attending classes today, so she nodded her head and left her bag alone as she walked to the door.</p><br><br><p>Melody led the girls to her car, and almost immediately Zoe, having been used to being forced to sit in the back, moved to the back. Melody didn't question it as she got into the driver's seat, and once Tracy got in, the car was started and they were on their way.</p><br><br><p>In front of the school was the bus they would be taking, so Zoe headed over there, followed by Tracy. ‶Have fun, girls!‶ Melody said as she walked into the school. Zoe added her and Tracy's names to the list, then climbed up with a wince, and Tracy held her so she wouldn't fall. Zoe moved to one of the front seats of the bus and Tracy followed her. Tracy's presence instantly caused an effect on her other classmates. Clueless, Zoe hadn't noticed the change, but Tracy could see they were nervous.</p><br><br><p>Zoe had forgotten about the gossip she'd overheard on Monday. Her thoughts went to the bus ride, and the trip ahead of her.</p><br><br><p>‶It's more bouncy at the back.‶Zoe said to Tracy. ‶That's why I don't want to go back there, plus I wanted to be careful.‶ Tracy nodded, though she knew why the bounciness was a concern for her sister.</p><br><br><p>Their teacher had handed out a pamphlet for the museum. Tracy accepted it and unfolded it. ‶So ... They showcased the Paleolithic era on the top floor. Want to go there first?‶ Zoe nodded her head. ‶Sure, though, would we remember what we've read?‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy nodded and then showed her cellphone ‶See, it has a notes feature, we could write some things in there, and then when we're home, we'll get it copied down as part of your assignment for Mr. Hist next semester's extra work.‶ Zoe smiled at the brilliance of Tracy's idea. It turned out that this was another reason why she'd said that they didn't need their backpacks.</p><br><br><p>Zoe looked at the pamphlet again. After all, the exhibit wasn't the only one, there were more. The top floor was a human history floor, showcasing humanity. Though she couldn't help but think of the apps on her sister's phone and saw how her sister had mostly jewel-based games, there was one she was interested in. It didn't look like any jewel game app. Unfortunately, with the bus's arrival, she got distracted.</p><br><br><p>The bus came to a complete stop at the entrance to the museum, and Tracy helped Zoe up out of her seat, and then helped her out of the bus. The other students and the teacher waited patiently for the two to make it off the bus before they got off, too. They all gathered around the teacher who began speaking.</p><br><br><p>‶Ok, we'll be splitting off into groups of three. You will each be choosing a floor and going there.‶ The teacher said, before adding, ‶oh and you had better behave,‶ she said. ‶Me, Zoe, and Cecilia are in a group,‶ Tracy responded before anyone could pick Zoe. The Teacher nodded. ‶Ok, I'm counting on you to make sure they behave‶ Tracy nodded with a grin, and then with her arm over their shoulders, they began going into the museum, then turning the corner and taking the elevator up.</p><br><br><p>The elevator took the girls on a quick trip up before the doors dinged open. The trio went to the seats in the middle, and after they placed the towel on it. Zoe rested on her butt, giving her feet a rest with a somewhat pained look. ‶Alright, rest your legs, Zee, I'm gonna look at things over there, and read out loud, ok?‶ Cecilia asked, and Zoe nodded, and Cecilia turned to Tracy ‶I'll leave you to watch over her alright?‶ Tracy smiled. ‶Sure, she's in good hands‶</p><br><br><p>‶She's as caring as you are,‶ Zoe commented to her sister as she watched Cecilia move towards the wall, and the plaque with the number 1 on it. Tracy simply smiled as once again she felt how happy that Zoe had a good friend.</p><br><br><p>‶Alright, let's see here...‶ Cecilia said to herself and looked at the plaque</p><br><br><p>The plaque on the wall had some information for museum-goers to read.</p><br><br><p><b>The onset of the Paleolithic Period has traditionally coincided with the first evidence of tool construction and use by Homo some 2.58 million years ago, near the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch (2.58 million to 11,700 years ago).</b></p><br><br><p><b>In 2015, however, researchers excavating a dry riverbed near Kenya's Lake Turkana discovered primitive stone tools embedded in rocks dating to 3.3 million years ago—the middle of the Pliocene Epoch (some 5.3 million to 2.58 million years ago). Those tools predate the oldest confirmed specimens of Homo by almost 1 million years, which raises the possibility that tool-making originated with Australopithecus or its contemporaries and that the timing of the onset of this cultural stage should be reevaluated.</b></p><br><br><p>Cecilia finished reading the plaque out loud, then switched to the next plaque</p><br><br><p><b>The Paleolithic Period ended when the Neolithic Period began. However, this transition point is much debated, as different parts of the world achieved the Neolithic stage at different times. It is generally thought to have occurred sometime in about 10,000 BCE. During that time, humans learned to raise crops and keep domestic livestock and were thus no longer dependent on hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants. These cultures made more useful stone tools by grinding and polishing harder rocks rather than merely chipping softer ones down to the desired shape. The cultivation of cereal grains enabled people to settle in one location, build permanent dwellings, and develop villages, and the release from nomadism and a hunting-and-gathering economy gave them the time to pursue specialized crafts.</b></p><br><br><p><b>[authors note: https://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period ]</b></p><br><br><p>Cecilia returned to Tracy and Zoe, and Tracy placed her cell phone down after jotting notes for Zoe's report.</p><br><br><p>‶It's amazing to think all those years ago, the climate was warmer than it was now.‶Cecilia said as Zoe nodded her head. ‶Yeah, I mean, if I were transported back then, I might be able to live amongst them and they won't think it odd a naked girl was there since there had to be naked people in the beginning.‶ Zoe said.</p><br><br><p>Tracy nodded before speaking. ‶True, though I don't know how they might react I mean our skin is likely different from theirs, and then there's the fact you're not as hairy as they'd be.‶ Cecilia nodded before adding her own observations ‶They might think you're some kind of goddess or something, especially if you just appear in front of them.‶ Cecilia grinned. ‶Goddess Zoe,‶ Tracy smiled and hugged Zoe closer. ‶That would be something.‶</p><br><br><p>As Zoe waited for her leg to stop hurting, she turned her attention to a display.</p><br><br><p>Zoe waited for her leg to stop hurting her and turned her head to the display. The first art depicted a hunter, naked as she was, but armed with a spear, or at least what seemed like a spear. There were foragers, both men and women, and they appeared naked too. Then it showed the passage of the eras, and now the humans wore fur outfits.</p><br><br><p>Once her leg stopped hurting, she stood up and walked through the exhibits, observing as the exhibits changed. She saw a plaque that mentioned that humanity's weapons were on a lower floor, which seemed to explain why there were more tools up there.</p><br><br><p>Tracy and Cecilia caught up to her and followed along on either side of her. They made sure that they could grab her should she fall or something. Periodically she'd make sure to take a seat, and they'd find information about humanity's development, including information about clothes. The Trio gave their best guess as to how long have humans spent naked before furs and eventually clothes were made.</p><br><br><p>Zoe's guess was a hundred years. While Cecilia thought it was a thousand years, Tracy's answer was a million years.</p><br><br><p>‶So why did humans create clothes, anyway?‶ Zoe asked, honestly interested. ‶Perhaps because of the climate, it was getting colder so humans needed the means to stay warm,‶ Tracy said as she finished writing the notes they'd discovered and eventually they found they had noted everything that they could find, so they decided to move to the Space Exhibit.</p><br><br><p>When they entered the Space Exhibit's floor, they discovered it was chilly. Cecilia and Tracy were fine because of the clothes they wore, but Zoe being naked meant she felt it much more so than the others. They also spotted their classmates here, as the six other students had chosen this area to view first. When the 6 spotted Zoe's group, they seemed to be in a hurry out of the area. Zoe thought it was odd, but she chose not to comment on it.</p><br><br><p>This allowed the trio space to explore this exhibit. Cecilia discovered when she tripped and fell, she fell right through Júpiter's area of the room. Turns out, all the rocky planets were solid while the gas giants were holographic. ‶Clever idea...‶ Tracy said after helping Cecilia up and the two went back to their previous activity, which was being close to Zoe and doing what they could to keep her warm.</p><br><br><p>Fortunately, they were able to make it to the next area, which they discovered was at a much more comfortable temperature.</p><br><br><p>‶I'm so ready to give them a lecture! I mean, with the program, there's a high chance for naked people. I mean, come on!‶ Cecilia stated out loud and pissed off on Zoe's behalf. Zoe, now sitting and rubbing her arms, didn't reply as Tracy rubbed her back, trying to bring warmth back to her sister's body more than their body warmth had.</p><br><br><p>They waited until Zoe was warm and rested before they moved on to their museum field trip. ‶So, where do we want to go next?‶ Tracy asked the young girls and glanced at the pamphlet. They could go to the flower exhibit, but neither of the Dancer sisters liked flowers much. Their Mama Kelly had an allergy to pollen, so the girls were always careful about being around flowers. Of course, they understood the need for them. The flowers looked beautiful, and sometimes smelled good, but Zoe didn't have a sense of smell, so that was likely lost to her.</p><br><br><p>‶The military exhibit?‶ Cecilia asked ‶we could see how humanity military evolved over time and looks like we might see how it might develop in the future,‶ Tracy nodded, then glanced to the clock ‶sure, we have time and then we have to join the others unless that's wrong, you two hungry?‶ Tracy asked her companions.</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded her head. ‶I do feel a little hungry,‶ she said while feeling bad that they might interrupt, then jumped as a door nearby slammed open to reveal her teacher. ‶Hey girls, come down, it's lunchtime!‶ They said.</p><br><br><p>Zoe smiled ‶looks like you were wrong, so let's go get something to eat!‶ she finished as she got up from the seat she'd been sitting on and the trio walked to the doors and took the elevator down to the main area where they were going to eat.</p><br><br><p>Zoe ate a hamburger, as did Cecilia, while Tracy ate a hot dog, which oddly caused a reaction from a nearby group of boys looking over. As they ate their food, the teacher came by and asked about their time. Cecilia took the initiative to speak for the trio. ‶It was fun. We learned a lot about the Paleolithic period, and then we went to the Space exhibit, which was a bad idea.‶</p><div id=‶sr‶><p></p><br><br><p>The teacher looked at Cecilia with confusion. ‶Why was it a bad idea?‶ She asked Cecilia, who replied, ‶Because it was fucking cold! Zoe is lucky she had us with her!‶ It surprised the teacher at the swearing in front of her, but she ignored that for something far more important. ‶Crap, I forgot about that. Otherwise I should have said something. I'm sorry!‶ This statement made it clear she was ignoring the swearing incident.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was blushing because of being the topic of attention. ‶It's ok; I was able to stay warm because they were so close and when we got to a warmer area, they helped my body to keep its warmth to make sure!‶</p><br><br><p>The Teacher soon left them and the trio went back to their lunch. But Zoe couldn't let something go. ‶You just swore in front of a teacher!‶ Cecilia just smiled plainly, but that was her only response, allowing the girls to go back to their food and drinks.</p><br><br><p>With the food and drink dealt with, they were free to sit and hang out until it was time to go back upstairs. ‶So aside from the coldness, are you two enjoying the trip?‶ Tracy asked the girls as she picked up her water bottle and drank from it.</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded her head ‶yeah, I'm learning a lot here‶ Cecilia also agreed with a nod of her head. Soon it was time to go back to their field trip, so Tracy helped Zoe up and led the way to the museum, Cecilia and Zoe following beside her.</p><br><br><p>As they had planned, they observed the military exhibit, and because of its type, there were more people there, making the going slow, so Zoe had to take more breaks when possible.</p><br><br><p>The girls saw how the military changed over the years and how weapons changed with the military. From spears, swords and daggers, to guns of various kinds, they saw how it all looked, and then they soon saw how it might change in the future.</p><br><br><p>This change also included robots being used to replace soldiers. This was because more and more families were reacting to military actions, including the deaths of loved ones, and the stress that soldiers had to deal with.</p><br><br><p>Of course with robots taking military jobs, there's always the speculation they will use that to kill humans when they overthrow humanity, but Zoe didn't want to think of it, since she had been worried that she'd be one of the first to be killed. It felt like a long time as they went looking at the museum exhibits.</p><br><br><p>Eventually there was another announcement through the museum speakers.</p><br><br><p><b>Students of Sir Fredric Banting High School, the bus has arrived to take you back, please return to the Lobby</b></p><br><br><p>With the announcement, Tracy turned, leading Zoe and Cecilia back towards the lobby. A few of their classmates soon joined them, but the trio didn't speak to them. It seemed that they were exhausted from the trip, judging by Zoe's yawn. Tracy and Zoe chose their front seat behind the driver, and Zoe leaned over to rest her eyes.</p><br><br><p>Tracy held her close and rested too, as Cecily got in the seat behind them, and the bus began moving and went on the journey back to school. Zoe heard her sister talking, and she recognized the teacher's voice and realized the teacher was thanking her big sister for coming to help look after Zoe. This caused her to blush with embarrassment. She also began feeling that maybe the Teacher thought that Zoe was some kind of troublemaker.</p><br><br><p>She heard the smile in her sister's voice as she spoke. ‶It's no problem, really. I loved coming along and making sure I can help with her.‶ Zoe allowed herself to rest without a visible reaction, hoping that they did not notice her blushing.</p><br><br><p>As the bus went on its journey, Tracy held Zoe a little tighter as they waited to return home. Zoe opened her eyes when she felt movement, and saw that Tracy was checking the time on her cell phone and the Dancer sisters saw that the fifth period was halfway done.</p><br><br><p>Tracy grinned as she noticed this. ‶Time flies when you're doing something interesting huh?' She asked Zoe, who she knew to be awake. ‶Yeah‶ Zoe replied as she sat up again. ‶So where are you going to go when we get back?‶ Zoe asked her sister.</p><br><br><p>‶I'm going to the gym to practice. Do you want to come?‶ Tracy replied and finished with her question to which Zoe nodded ‶yeah, sounds like fun.‶ ‶I'm going to head to the library. I think I have something due for class tomorrow,‶ Cecilia said.</p><br><br><p>So on arrival at the school, the Dancer sisters split from Cecilia and walked to the gym. Tracy took Zoe up to the middle of the seats and made sure there was something for Zoe to sit on. Tracy handed her cell phone over, after taking it to the games, apps folder before she left her to get changed into her basketball uniform.</p><br><br><p>The games Zoe played distracted her until she remembered the app she'd seen before, and moved from the games folder to the mysterious app and clicked on it.</p><br><br><p>Her eyes blinked in surprise as she discovered the app was a chat app using a network. She also saw that Tracy Logged in, which was odd since she knew her sister had gone to get changed. As the young nude teen looked, she saw Cecilia's name, including her last name, and that she was in a chat with Jake Malcolms who she recognized as Tracy's boyfriend.</p><br><br><p>Jake had been asking about the trip, and Cecilia regaled him with the events that happened, including the cold space room. Zoe saw others seemed interested based on what she was reading. ‶What in the world is this‶ Zoe said to herself.</p><br><br><p>Zoe's eyes blinked as she saw other names on the member list, names that went to the school, and the names that were in her class, too. Zoe realized that the conversation seemed to be more towards how she, Zoe, had been throughout the trip. It seemed she'd had admirers.</p><br><br><p>Zoe realized that she could see the dates in the chat app, and so she scrolled up to Monday. Having seen how concerned they were over her, she wondered how did they react to her entering the program.</p><br><br><p>When she looked, she saw messages in response to hearing her name, after a bit of a delay. One member in the chat app vented how he hated being right. Apparently he guessed that it was she who'd been the 9th grader to be picked. She saw other responses to that and more, along with a promise that they'd keep a better eye out on her.</p><br><br><p>As she began lowering, she also saw in the second period on Monday that someone had seen her accident. This caused her to gasp and feel the heat come to her cheeks. As far as the texts told her, only her sister was told, and also a mention of contacting a janitor who was their father so that he could clean it up.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe sat back on the bleachers, she processed what she had discovered. Someone had seen, and they knew she'd peed on the floor. Not only that, but her sister knew, and her sister didn't tease her about it. The young teen decided she wouldn't talk to her sister about it, since she felt embarrassed then, and likely would feel embarrassed now.</p><br><br><p>Cecilia in the chat and back then had noticed that something was wrong, and in the chat she'd asked and Tracy told her to cheer Zoe up but wouldn't say what was going on. Zoe felt a little horrified that her best friend knew about this chat app and hadn't told her about it, or let her know that there was a group so concerned about her.</p><br><br><p>Zoe noticed her sister wasn't out yet, so she turned her focus back to the chat app. She scrolled down its length and noticed that regularly for hours on end there were lags between where the students focused on work. The only time where there were chats in these lags was there was a concern like Cecilia had when she came back in the second period.</p><br><br><p>Thoughts filled her mind about whether this chat thing was how her sister knew where she was. She was suspecting that the answer was yes. As she scrolled down once more, she discovered the reaction to the incident with the boy who wanted to shove his hand inside her. She remembered his reaction, like he saw a ghost or something that frightened him.</p><br><br><p>Turns out, from what she was reading in the chat, a group of football players had stepped up behind her, and one called Moose gave him a stern look. Apparently, Moose had a rep for scary looks. She read how a kid she knew from her class, who had an honor for being intelligent had made a joke about how scared the bad kid was, and then saw talks about whether Moose's look or the Principals were scarier, and thoughts on whether they could create a contest.</p><br><br><p>Then, she got to the event with the boy, Richard Sunder, but surprisingly, they were calling him by a different name, Dick Sucker? She thought that was odd. Though after she made her escape, Tracy was asking where she had gone to and if anyone saw her.</p><br><br><p>Another kid on the network had seen who they described as a cute naked girl scurrying into the Auditorium. Zoe blushed as she was called cute since the girl they were talking about was her.</p><br><br><p>She knew what happened next on Monday. She ran and had gotten into a leg spasm, because of her D syndrome. But she saw that afterwards the Principal had joined the Chat App's Chat Room Network and taken part by talking there. Zoe had just finished reading about the commentary about Richard Sunder's words and how she seemed to agree with them, before she decided she wanted to look for the reason why this chat room existed.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe looked and then scrolled up. She found out the reason for the specific network in the app. Tracy had been worried about her, so Brooke found it, and had set it up so that they can keep an eye on her. It would be another proof that her sister was protective and cared about her.</p><br><br><p>When a sudden text had appeared, it brought her from where she was back to the current date and time. She saw they found out Tracy wasn't logged in to the chat network, but Zoe was. This was because Tracy had told them that she had her phone. She instantly closed out of it, and placed the cell phone back, and quietly processed what she learned.</p><br><br><p>As she did so, she looked down at her feet, and felt renewed guilt at how much her sister cared, also disbelief that the chat network existed, and that there were people watching out for her. She didn't look up even as the doors opened and voices echoed upwards, but she did eventually spot a pair of feet standing in front of her.</p><br><br><p>The feet belonged to her sister, and instantly Zoe spoke to her. ‶you knew about-MMF!‶ She didn't get to finish as Tracy placed a hand over Zoe's mouth. ‶shh, let's talk about that at home, ok?‶ Zoe nodded with another blush on her cheeks. With that agreement, she watched as Tracy rejoined the small group and then observed their practice.</p><br><br><p>As she watched the practice game, her head turned as the basketball shot from one side to the other. She watched as players caught the ball and tossed it, and heard the subtle sounds of the ball hitting the net, and then times when it just hit the rim and fell back.</p><br><br><p>It fascinated her to watch this display of action, and she couldn't help but call down to them. ‶Awesome job!‶ Though instantly, as she blushed, she shut herself up. She pondered about what it might be like to play sports like this, though, as she pondered, practice soon slowed a little. She couldn't help but see her sister getting a little distracted. Until, ‶Sorry, there's something I'd like to do‶ Tracy said and turned to walk over towards her. Zoe blinked, looking up at her, and continued to blink in confusion as she saw her approach her. ‶Hey sis, come with me a sec, ok?‶ Zoe blinked her eyes in confusion, but she got up anyway and followed her.</p><br><br><p>The 9th grader, followed her down the bleacher steps. She noticed that when they were down on the floor level, Tracy was leading her to the baskets. She also noticed that she was the only one naked, which meant there weren't members of the girls' basketball team that were in the program.</p><br><br><p>Now standing beside the basket, she looked at her sister, unable to find words to her question about why Tracy had brought her down there. Suddenly Tracy lifted her hands, in the position Zoe recognized used to catch the ball, and it seemed to click in her team mates' mind. Smiles appeared on their faces, and they passed the ball to her sister.</p><br><br><p>With the ball in one hand, Tracy took Zoe's arm and lightly guided her further to the side, and maneuvered her so that she was in front of the Basket. Tracy startled Zoe by placing the ball in her hands due to how distracted she was. Now paying attention, she took a moment to examine it. It was orange, with black stripes in weird directions, and the ball itself felt and looked bumpy. It felt odd holding it, and as she looked at her sister, she wondered why she was given the ball. Tracy started talking to Zoe, causing her to listen to her. ‶I know with your condition you can't run, but I wanted you to experience at least once, tossing the ball in. Don't worry if you don't make it, it's ok.‶</p><br><br><p>From the comments of the others on the team, Zoe thought they seemed to be supportive, which Zoe appreciated. As the youngest member in the room turned to focus on the basket, a few of the girls in the team gave her some helpful tips that they thought that someone who hadn't played would find useful. She also felt movement behind her as Tracy moved to stand behind, which she figured made it easier to grab her in case she fell.</p><br><br><p>Following the advice she was given, Zoe allowed herself to calm her breathing. She knew fear and intimidation may cause problems as she tossed the ball. The teen allowed focus on the act to concentrate on what she was doing, before eventually she tossed the ball. The ball flew towards the net, but because of how new Zoe was to the sport, and how she hadn't quite got the diagonalizing skills yet, it hit the rim of the basket.</p><br><br><p>It disappointed her, but she remembered what the girls, and especially Tracy, were saying especially about how she shouldn't let her failure to get to her. As a teammate, she'd recognized as Keisha, caught the ball, and gently handed it over. This allowed Zoe to try again, and with greater concentration and focus, allowing the ball to go into the net. This pleased her, and she turned to her sister to hug her, and she could not stop herself from kissing her on the cheek.</p><br><br><p>Tracy hugged her back but didn't kiss her amid the giggles of her teammates. They soon took Zoe back to the bleachers and Zoe sat there with a grin on her face. She didn't know it, but someone would soon post her success out to the others in that chat network app she saw.</p><br><br><p>Zoe spent the rest of the time watching the girls practice, though she couldn't help but think about things unrelated to the game that she discovered.</p><br><br><p>Finally, the bell rang for the end of school that day, and Tracy got changed into her normal clothes before she walked toward Zoe, who had come down from the bleachers. Tracy saw Zoe was tired, and figured that with the field trip and, of course, getting a ball into the net for those that couldn't take part in the sport was an exhilarating thing.</p><br><br><p>She recalled with previous concerns about liability, that Tracy couldn't give her a piggyback ride, so instead she allowed Zoe to lean against her with her arm over her bare shoulders.</p><br><br><p>As they walked, Zoe rested her eyes as she held onto her sister. ‶Hey ... You're not going to tease me, are you?‶ Tracy smiled. ‶tease you about getting a ball into the hoop? No way, I'm proud of you,‶ Zoe smiled at her silly sister. She hadn't been talking about that, but she remembered they were going to talk about it at home, so she stayed quiet.</p><br><br><p>Before long, they'd met up with the others. ‶Hey, guess what? Zoe got a basketball into the hoop!‶ Tracy said as a way of bragging. The other girls and her best friend gasped, and then clapped for her ‶awesome job Zoe!‶ Tracy looked over at her sister and smiled. ‶No Tease, but I am gonna brag about how amazing my little sister is.‶</p><br><br><p>As they walked to the vehicle, Zoe blushed at the praise. They placed Zoe in first, before Cecilia got in beside her, and then the others. The ride was a quiet one, as three of the number were tired from their adventure, so they dropped them at home first. Now at home, Zoe rode a piggy back ride up the stairs of their home, and after a bit of shifting, they entered it. ‶Moms?!‶ Tracy called, but no answer, before Tracy took Zoe up to her room.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was placed on her chair before Tracy grabbed a cloth that she made wet and used it to give her sister a sort of sponge bath, taking care of the sweat that had developed. ‶So, seriously, you knew, and you hadn't teased me? Or something, just a call to the janitor to get it cleaned up?‶ Zoe finally said.</p><br><br><p>Tracy glanced up as she knelt down and tenderly washed her feet and massaged them. ‶You were upset, and I thought Cecilia was the best choice to cheer you up. When I came to check on you in the third period, that was a little more than half the reason. I figured you'd be upset and thought you wouldn't want to be reminded. I admit I am troubled about the accident, but I'm kinda hoping it happened because you were preoccupied and not focused.‶ Tracy finished before drying her sister off, and then moving to her closet. She selected the bottom half of her outfit from the closet and then the top, including underwear.</p><br><br><p>Tracy said as she returned with her clothes, and Zoe lifted her arms so Tracy could first put the bra on her tired sister, then the shirt. ‶I'm not going to tease you; I mean, I had an embarrassing incident of my own. Want me to tell you?‶ This caused Zoe to blink her eyes, as she hadn't heard of her sister getting an embarrassing incident of her own. She didn't know that her sister, and now the principal, had information securely controlled.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe thought about how embarrassed her sister had to have been, The young teen found she wasn't sure she wanted to know, since she didn't want her to relive the incident. ‶Nah...‶ she said after a while.</p><br><br><p>This surprised Tracy, but smiled at how thoughtful Zoe was. Soon, Zoe was dressed, and she found that having spent the whole day naked, wearing clothes felt odd to her. At that time, their parents had eventually joined them at home. From what both Nicole and Kelly told them, there was an issue with their other aunt Mara that their aunt Melody needed their parents' attention to. Kelly got supper ready for the four to eat, and Nicole sent their teens off to their rooms to work on homework they needed to work on before bed.</p>"

        title: "Thursday",
        content: "<p>When Zoe woke up that Thursday Morning, she remembered she will be hanging out with Brooke that day. Zoe stretched her arms and opened her eyes. Tracy was, of course, there, so she got up and hugged her before moving to the bathroom. Having removed her pajamas, she tossed it into the laundry hamper before she got up and walked into the shower, where she hurriedly got herself washed before coming out to sit over the covered toilet.</p><br><br><p>This allowed her to rest her feet and get herself dry from the shower before getting dried. ‶Zoe! Breakfast is ready!‶ Her mother called, ‶I'll be right there!‶ Zoe replied, and walked out of her bathroom. Two more days, she thought, two more days and I'll be dressed forever. Zoe had gotten used to going to school naked, but it would overjoy her to be clothed again.</p><br><br><p>Zoe found her seat beside her sister and mother, whom like the day before, were naked as she was. Nicole has placed the plates with their breakfast before them, while being assisted by her elder sister. Zoe couldn't help but notice the breasts of her mother and sister jiggling and move as they worked. She tried not to think about it too much and let it distract her, or worse, cause offense.</p><br><br><p>With her mother and sisters' work complete, the naked women began eating their breakfast. This time, they ate the eggs of varying styles. Zoe liked scrambled eggs, while Tracy liked it sunny side up, and Nicole liked it poached. Zoe didn't know what style her other mother, Kelly liked, but she had a suspicion that it was scrambled like her.</p><br><br><p>With Breakfast finally finished, Zoe left the dining room and entered the living room to watch TV while she waited for her mom and sister to get ready. She knows their routine, so she didn't think about her mother and sister, leaving the room to get ready. When Tracy came in and found Zoe sitting on the couch, she sat beside her. Zoe allowed her body to lean over towards her sister, who held her close. The two watched together quietly, save for giggles during the hilarious parts.</p><br><br><p>They were watching a comedy TV because of daylight savings time screwing with TV schedules. Unfortunately, they couldn't finish the show they were watching as their mother returned to them and brought them to the car. They spent their ride talking about the day's events and how different it will be. Eventually they could see their high school, and the girls spotted Brook, with Cecilia, Jill, and Jan.</p><br><br><p>When Nicole parked the car, and Zoe got out, beside Tracy, Brooke shortly moved to give Zoe and then Tracy a hug in greeting. As Zoe watched, she saw Brooke move to stand behind her and felt an arm around her shoulders. Zoe appreciated how careful Brooke was in not touching her breasts. ‶Morning Cutie, I heard you got a ball in a hoop yesterday. I have to say I am so proud!‶ Brooke said, and at the cutie comment, Zoe couldn't help but blush.</p><br><br><p>She continued blushing as Cecilia tagged on. ‶Yeah, that sounded so amazing. I wish I had thought to follow you to the gym,‶ said Cecilia, before Jan added her own comments, which echoed how amazed she had felt. Zoe soon spoke of the topic in her own words. ‶Yeah, I'm glad Tracy brought me up there to toss the ball. It was amazing! To be able to toss the ball in.‶</p><br><br><p>The nude teen remembered her discovery yesterday and wondered if Tracy had told the others who hadn't been aware. Thus far, they didn't seem to comment on it, but she noticed Cecilia looking at her periodically with an odd look on her face. Instead of speaking, she leaned into Brooke, who held her close. Her mind processed the feelings of clothes on naked skin, as well as Brooke's skin on her own. Brooke was warm, perhaps because she stayed a bit in the school's warmth.</p><br><br><p>‶Man, do I ever feel excited, I get to keep Zoe all day.‶ Brooke said with a smile to Zoe, before her attention went to Tracy and in a serious tone of voice, she spoke to her. ‶I promise to be on my best behavior, and Zoe will be safe with me. I also got everything set up with my teachers.‶ Brooke had said. Zoe turned her head to her sister, who nodded her head in approval. ‶I trust you Brooke, you're my best friend and you're a kind person,‶ Tracy had said in reply.</p><br><br><p>Cecilia was the next to speak, but it was to Brooke, telling her about the special way of walking that she and Zoe had discovered. Brooke nodded, accepting the important info and adjusted how she was holding Zoe so that Zoe didn't put too much weight on her right foot. At that moment, the bell rang for the start of school. This meant that they should go their separate ways. Tracy placed a hand on Cecilia's shoulder, and Brooke did the same with Zoe, and they walked. When Brooke didn't stop at the elevator, Zoe looked up at her and opened her mouth to ask.</p><br><br><p>‶My first class is downstairs,‶ Brooke said, having sensed the question Zoe wanted to ask. The younger teen quietly nodded her head and followed beside her as they walked. As Brooke continued to have her arm over Zoe's shoulder, the 9th grader found she enjoyed having Brooke's arms over her shoulder. She felt protected by it. Zoe also used Brooke's strength, as Cecilia had warned her as they made their journey into Brooke's first class.</p><br><br><p>Zoe blinked her eyes in surprise as she took in the classroom before her. They lined the room with mirrors and chairs in front of them. As the two entered, she caught sight of the teacher's desk, which was attached to the wall across from the door. ‶Morning miss Boobier!‶ Brooke said, calling out to the teacher as she led Zoe inside. The teacher, a woman with red hair, looked up and smiled at the two of them. ‶Ah, hello Brooke, who is the cutie with you?‶ She asked as the two teens came closer towards the teacher, only to stop at the chair and mirror set closest to the teacher's desk.</p><br><br><p>Zoe couldn't help but spot a mannequin head with hair, which immediately told her this was the cosmetology class. Though at being called Cutie, again Zoe blushed with embarrassment. She allowed Brooke to introduce her as she saw Brooke take a towel from the teacher and placed it on the seat, and tenderly she got Zoe to sit on it, and the seat.</p><br><br><p>‶The cutie is Zoe, Zoe Dancer, who is the younger sister of the girl's Basketball Team Captain, Tracy,‶ Brooke said as she made sure that Zoe was relaxed in the seat. Zoe's head instantly shot to Brooke as she discovered something new about her sister. ‶Wait, Tracy's the captain of the Team?! She never said!‶ Zoe said and noted the other students entering the class. She noticed she was the only one in the program amongst them, which caused her to feel a little embarrassed. She also saw they seemed to be alone and not with a companion like she was.</p><br><br><p>‶Yeah, she doesn't like to brag about it.‶ Brooke explained, as around them the other students got themselves set up with a mannequin. As the teen noticed they were sitting in the seats, it made her feel guilty about stealing the seat. The teacher had gotten up from her seat and had approached Brooke, as Zoe spoke her apology ‶Sorry, I stole her seat, didn't I? I'll get up.‶ Around this time she started getting up, but Brooke and the Teacher placed their hands on her shoulders. ‶stay‶ they said, and she saw them smile. ‶So what do you think, Brooke?‶ The Teacher asked as they looked at Zoe.</p><br><br><p>Zoe, like most girls at the school, had long hair. Her own almost covered her eyes at the front, and at the back it came near her butt.</p><br><br><p>‶I'd like to part her hair so that her eyes aren't covered, but might need to cut it, and at the back, maybe we bind it like that one character in ... What's it called ... Evil Sky? Yeah, she had pink hair that was kept in a long ponytail. I think it went below her butt, but hers isn't that long,‶ Brook said with a smile for Zoe's benefit.</p><br><br><p>Zoe sat there with confusion on her mind as the mannequin behind her didn't have that long hair. She didn't know what the two were talking about before the Teacher spoke. ‶Indeed, might be the best, since she isn't supposed to be covered in the Program, though I had thought of giving you the assignment for twin tails, think that would look better?‶ Zoe realized they were talking about her which made her blush. Brooke grinned ‶oh that would look cute on her!‶ The teacher smiled, before she nodded her head. ‶Then that's the plan.‶ She said before she moved on to check on the other students.</p><br><br><p>Fear shot through Zoe's entire body as she started to fret that Brooke might get a lower mark because of her. ‶Please, no, I ... I'm not cute, not like you or Tracy,‶ Zoe begged, but she became distracted as Brooke hugged the naked girl and kissed her on her lips. ‶Dont worry, and you're wrong, you are cute. Just need to bring it out into the open and I will.‶</p><br><br><p><b>[Authors Note: I'd like to mention that I have never attended the cosmetology class at my high school, but I have had friends who did and I saw some mannequin heads, so I thought this was it, I apologize If I was wrong]</b></p><br><br><p>The act of getting kissed surprised her, and Brooke used that to her advantage. Zoe both felt and saw her hair moving from her vision. She also saw them fall away as Brooke used a pair of scissors to cut them. She knew this meant she wouldn't be able to hide her eyes anymore. The teen saw Brooke turn her chair and face the mirrors, and she could see what Brooke was doing.</p><br><br><p>She continued watching as Brooke pulled her hair back tenderly and draped it over the chair. After this was done, Brooke began working on her hair, turning the long strands into twin tails.</p><br><br><p>She showed Zoe how she looked with another mirror after she finished. Zoe continued to blush as she saw herself. ‶She has Hazel eyes?‶ The Teacher asked as she saw her eyes for the first time. ‶Yeah, Tracy mentioned she should have hazel eyes. And looks like that hasn't changed since she was 6 years old.‶ Brooke told her teacher and turned her attention to Zoe again.</p><br><br><p>With her attention on Zoe's face, Brooke noticed she was blushing, and frowned as she thought of a way to help Zoe.</p><br><br><p>Brooke set down the comb and the other tools she used and then helped Zoe to stand. ‶be brave, you are cute, and beautiful ... but don't take my word for it‶ Brooke whispered to Zoes ears as their teacher soon spoke to the class ‶ ‶Everyone, I'd like you all to look at Brooke's companion and how beautiful she looks.‶ Brooke moved Zoe forward to show off the blushing 14-year-old program participant. Zoe could hear comments, all of which were a form of how cute she was.</p><br><br><p>As the teen scanned the room, she spotted and recognized two of the girls in the class who had been there yesterday in the Gym.</p><br><br><p>Brooke lightly led Zoe through the classroom so that the class could get a closer look, as well as the two basketball players. She'd learned already that the players were Alice Swan and Tina Mack. As Zoe and Brooke came closer, they each smiled at the 14-year-old and lightly placed their hands on her cheek. ‶I wish I was in grade 11 and could have chosen you! Gosh, you're so cute!‶ ‶Right?!‶ Brook and Tina said at the same time, before she brought Zoe back to sit and she watched her focus on the other work she needed to take care of.</p><br><br><p>It fascinated Zoe as she watched the class continue their work and turned her attention to the mirror again. It had been a while since she'd seen her face like this, and she didn't think it was normal. Before she knew it, the bell rang, as she'd gotten distracted by her watching. Brooke helped her up and once more placed her arm around Zoe's shoulders. But this time, Zoe felt different, because her hair was providing some cover. Now, because of what Brooke had done to her, her hand had snuck under her hair.</p><br><br><p>Brooke's hand was warm to the touch, so she didn't complain about it as they left. Though unfortunately, Brooke's next class was upstairs, so they had to walk down a hall to the elevator, and then walk in the opposite direction.</p><br><br><p>The class was a Computer Programming class, and the two were quiet as Brooke led the way to the back. ‶I'm far-sighted, so back here is perfect for me, and don't worry about taking notes, just listen,‶ Brooke whispered in Zoe's ear. As the two came to what Zoe discovered to be Brooke's desk, she spotted a chair with a towel resting on it.</p><br><br><p>It was as if it was waiting for a program participant to sit on it. Brooke sat down at her computer, and Zoe sat down, though, because of how a girl across from them was looking, she moved to sit closer to Brooke. Brooke just patted her in comfort before she focused on her work.</p><br><br><p>As Brooke worked, they impressed Zoe with Brooke's typing speed, and how the words, or what looked like words, just speedily appeared. Because of how strict the bald-headed teacher seemed to be, she chose not to say anything. She didn't want to distract Brooke and get into trouble with him.</p><br><br><p>The young teen was glad that he hadn't asked her if she wanted relief. Perhaps when preparing for her, he learned not to ask. But because of how scary and strict he seemed to be, she felt too scared to ask for the bathroom, so she held it. She was certain she could control her urge, and at the same time, Brooke finished her work. At which point she called the teacher over and pressed a button that turned her code into a program that worked well. ‶Excellent work, Brooke, you have some free 15 minutes until the class ends ... why don't you ... Take your companion to the bathroom, she looks like she needs it‶ The teacher said in a whisper, that only Brooke and Zoe could hear.</p><br><br><p>Brooke reacted by looking over at Zoe immediately, and at the moment she saw how she was behaving, she instantly got Zoe up and led the way to the bathroom. Zoe soon found herself in the stall, and she soon sat down.</p><br><br><p>‶Zee, don't you ask to go to the bathroom?‶ Brooke asked as she leaned against the wall. ‶Yeah,‶ was Zoe's reply, which caused a reaction from Brooke in a sound escaping her before she spoke her question ‶then why didn't you ask?‶ The question caused Zoe to blush ‶cause he looked strict, I thought he wouldn't allow it.‶ Brooke laughed a little, though she stifled that quick. ‶He's all bark. He won't prevent you from going if you need to. Plus, he lawfully can't do that,‶ Brooke said before she added ‶if you're worried about causing me to become distracted when I should be working, don't, I'll never get angry at you if you actually need something.‶ Brooke finished, only to hear ‶Oh,‶ coming from Zoe in response.</p><br><br><p>After Zoe finished her business, Brooke washed both of their hands, then led the way back to the classroom.</p><br><br><p>Of course, with their luck, the bell rang before they could enter it, so Brooke hurried to get her things, then led Zoe to her third-period class. Which was Home EC, specifically the sewing portion of the class. Brooke got Zoe to a seat so that Zoe could rest before she turned to the teacher for the class.</p><br><br><p>‶Morning, Miss Lite. Before we begin, I was just thinking and had an idea. I remembered you saying you might not have a semester final for this class, and so I was thinking, for tomorrow as a due date, think we could make clothes? See Zoe's clothes were stolen on Monday, so her family is concerned about her wearing clothes on the way here, but Friday is the end of her program, so I was hoping we could make something for her to wear at the end of school tomorrow, would that be ok?‶ Brooke asked her teacher.</p><br><br><p>Zoe blinked in surprise, and she saw the other students listening, and they also turned their heads to look at her, which caused her to blush. She'd also seen that there didn't seem to be as many students here as in the other class. She remembered that Home EC was also offered to 9th graders, so maybe the other students were also with their chosen 11 Grader like she was.</p><br><br><p>Ms. Lite took but a moment to think about it, and as the other students seemed to be delighted with the idea, she agreed with a nod. ‶Ok, and since it was your idea, I'll allow you to pick who does what,‶ she said. Brooke nodded ‶I handle underwear, Chloe, you have her top, and Becky her pants‶ Each nodded their heads, and Ms. Lite took out a measuring tape and handed that to Brooke before going to her desk.</p><br><br><p>‶Should I get up?‶ Zoe asked Brooke, who shook her head, ‶Not yet, I'll tell you when,‶ Brooke said and began taking her measurements. First, the tape went around her body, underneath her breasts and ribs. From what Zoe saw, Brooke made clear notes. As she finished, Zoe noticed another student, Chloe, come over to copy the notes since they regarded the top half of her body.</p><br><br><p>Brooke then turned her attention to Zoe and spoke to her. ‶Alright, Zee, I'm going to measure your breasts in a moment. But it will only be me doing that, ok?‶ Brooke told Zoe and gave her time to prepare herself. Brooke knew Zoe was uncomfortable with people touching her, including anything remotely sexual, so she wanted to let her prepare.</p><br><br><p>Brooke breathed on her hands and rubbed them. This made her hands warm to the touch, and then she took the measuring tape and measured Zoe's breasts. Her fingers grazed Zoe's breasts, causing Zoe to jump at the contact, but Brooke's hand's felt warm to her. ‶Sorry, Zee,‶ she whispered, as she didn't want to cause Zoe discomfort more than she had.</p><br><br><p>Brooke was quick to take measurements of her companion's breasts, then whispered into Zoe's ear, asking what was her normal bra size. With a blush, Zoe whispered back the answer, which surprised Brooke. But with the measurements she'd taken, only confirmed the size, she finished her work. They then made Zoe lie on a table, where the other student who had been copying Brooke's notes took measurements of her arms, but this time for her lower half.</p><br><br><p>Before long, everyone was around her, taking notes, making measurements of the leg of her arms and legs and everything. This was frightening Zoe, so Brooke moved to her head, so that Zoe can see her there and not panic. This allowed Zoe to wait calmly as the class took measurements from her.</p><br><br><p>Zoe then used the opportunity to ask Brooke another question, ‶so ... What's your next class after this?‶ she asked Brooke, hoping it distracted her. ‶Health class,‶ Brooke replied, then widened her eyes. ‶Oh, crap‶ ‶What?' Asked Zoe and their teacher at the same time. ‶So far this week, there have been no program participants in the class...‶ ‶s ... Wait, does that mean that ... I might be used?‶ Zoe's eyes widened in horror and fear.</p><br><br><p>If the teacher was evil, they could take her virginity or something, but she hoped they didn't. But what was worse, they might want to touch her. Zoe panicked as fear set in, forcing Brooke to move a classmate aside to hug her and comfort her.</p><br><br><p>‶Oh yeah, that's ordinarily the case,‶ Ms. Lite said, ‶but this day is different and Zoe isn't enrolled for the class. She'll be there, absolutely, but only as your companion, and as far as the school is concerned, unless the teachers had Brooke's permission, they can't do anything to you. Essentially, you're like Brooke's kid, or maybe a pet might also be the case is what the School's thought is.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe's eyes blinked as she listened to the teacher's words and felt her panic settle. The young teen wasn't sure she liked the idea of being called a pet, let alone Brooke's kid. The idea of being considered a pet, however, caused her to remember stories. Of two sisters forced to act like dogs, including going on walks, and peeing and pooping outside. It was odd to think about, and she was glad that they did not include it in her high school.</p><br><br><p>‶Pet, huh?‶ Brooke asked with a mischievous smile, but that changed when she saw the fear on Zoe's face. ‶Whoa, don't worry Zee, I am not going to treat you like that!‶ Brookes' words caused Zoe to noticeably relax. The others finished with their measurements and went to their stations. Brooke helped Zoe off the table and got her to sit on a stool so that she could watch her work. Periodically Brooke would look at Zoe, and then go to grab the material she will use and the other stuff to make proper underwear.</p><br><br><p>Zoe noticed that the others in the room were glancing at her as well. She assumed it was because she was naked, so she tried not to let it bother her. Instead, her mind focused on the day's events. She'd gotten her hairstyle changed, and she got to see a programming class, which she found interesting. She wasn't sure what classes she would be in next semester other than History but maybe she hoped they might let her take programming.</p><br><br><p>Zoe soon became so lost in thought that the time passed by swiftly and the bell rang for lunch. Brooke tenderly shook her to get her attention. ‶Come, it's time for us to get some food,‶ she told her companion, and helped her off the table so Zoe could follow her. Zoe leaned into Brooke and Brooke had her arm over her shoulder again.</p><br><br><p>When the two spotted their friends, Brooke called to them and watched as they turned and then gasp at the sight of Zoe's new hairstyle. ‶Oh. MY. FUCKING. GOODNESS!!: Cecilia couldn't help but exclaim as she stepped toward her best friend. ‶Zoe! You look cute!‶ Zoe just blushed at the compliments. ‶Brooke, I owe you a debt of gratitude!‶ Tracy said as she saw her sister's new hairstyle.</p><br><br><p>Jill and Jan both agreed that Zoe looked better this way. They soon found their seats, and Tracy and Brooke went to grab food. Zoe thought that as Brooke was responsible for her, that she was getting food for her too, but she wasn't sure. But she heard Brooke tell Tracy about what her Home EC class will be doing for tomorrow. Cecilia stayed back to keep Zoe company, leaving Jill to go grab food for her sister as well. Jan just took out her lunch bag and got herself ready.</p><br><br><p>‶So how are Brooke's classes?‶ Cecilia asked Zoe, who promptly responded. ‶they are fine, her Second period was fascinating, she's in a programming class, and I'm hoping I could take that next semester., and her Thirds Home EC, though it was at the point where they were in the room with the sewing machines. Brooke got to be in charge, and she told them that they will be making an outfit for me to wear tomorrow.‶ She told Cecilia.</p><br><br><p>Cecilia grinned as she listened. ‶That was nice of her and was her first period where your new hairstyle came from?‶ Zoe nodded her head and saw Tracy and Brooke returning. Tracy set down Zoe's food in front of her. ‶Bon Apatite, sis,‶ Tracy said as she moved her food across from her sister and sat.</p><br><br><p>‶Thanks, Tracy,‶ she said cheerfully and began eating her food. ‶Zoe was telling me she enjoyed your Second period, and third, Brooke.‶ Cecilia said as she began eating her food as well. ‶Second, and third, not first, then?‶ Brooke frowned, but she hoped to make it up to her, and do something Zoe will enjoy.</p><br><br><p>‶So from what I remember, Tracy's second period class is art with Mr. Barr. So, did you enjoy that?‶ Zoe asked her best friend, and felt pleased when Cecilia had nodded her head, and said, ‶it was so neat! To see how the colors changed, and to see them put art on this paper thingy they were using.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe saw Tracy smile as she listened to the conversation the 14-year-olds were having. ‶Tracy also drew me, too. Which was nice of her!‶ Cecilia had added, causing Zoe to smile, and also to remember about how she'll be attending Tracy's class tomorrow.</p><br><br><p>As time passed, the girls ate their lunches, and the conversation happened between the 9th graders in the group who spoke of their time shadowing the two 11th graders. Zoe learned that, like Brooke, Tracy also had a spare period. She learned Brooke had one because her class had been inhabited almost entirely by 9th graders except for her.</p><br><br><p>Tracy planned on taking Cecilia out on to their date, but Brooke would stay back as she needed to practice for Band, Zoe also learned she'd also wanted to take the chance of getting Zoe prepared as well as to see what she could do.</p><br><br><p>Finally, the bell rang, signalling the start of the fourth-period classes. Cecilia and Tracy said their goodbyes before leaving, as had Jill and Jan to go find their companions. Brooke helped Zoe up and led her to her fourth period. Sensing Zoe's growing fear, Brooke held her close to comfort her as they walked. ‶It's gonna be ok, Zee,‶ Brooke told her as they walked and used the elevator to her next class.</p><br><br><p>The Teacher spotted Brooke and Zoe as they entered and spoke to them. ‶ah, Brooke, and excellent a program participant, could we-‶ The Teacher started saying but was cut off. Brooke replied with a ‶No‶ and all the teacher could get out was ‶but-‶ before Brooke explained ‶No, she's a flight risk to fainting if anything even casually sexual happens to her‶</p><br><br><p>The teacher just blinked, but as Brooke's third-period teacher said since the Fourth-period teacher didn't have her permission, she didn't do anything. They guided Zoe to the back, where there was an extra seat waiting for her.</p><br><br><p>Zoe watched as Brooke completed her worksheet, which talked about hygiene, and the various techniques needed. She thought they were common sense, and she couldn't help but wonder why they needed to work on that for school. Zoe blushed when she saw the parts regarding female genitals. ‶That's not real or normal,‶ she whispered in Brooke's ear. Brooke giggled and nodded. ‶Right?!‶</p><br><br><p>The page's art showed a mutilated genital area that had been circumcised. As Zoe had never seen a circumcised private parts before, she thought the ones she'd seen were unnatural.</p><br><br><p>After a while, Brooke took a break, and Zoe leaned back before she heard Brooke whispering into her ear. ‶Zee, I need to use the toilet. How about you?‶ Brooke asked. As Brooke asked, Zoe had indeed felt she needed to use the toilet, so the girls got up and went to the front, where Brooke got permission.</p><br><br><p>Zoe went into the last stall, and Brooke went in beside her, where they did their business before heading to the sinks. Brooke took Zoe's hand and washed her hands, as well as her own. ‶You like doing that, don't you?‶ Zoe asked with a smile, ‶of course, plus Tracy will kill me if I let any germs get to you,‶ Brooke replied almost deadpan. Brooke soon led the way back and Zoe observed once more, before the bell for 6th period.</p><br><br><p>‶Alright!‶ Brooke said enthusiastically, as excitement filled her, as well as Zoe. ‶I know you didn't like the first period. I'm truly sorry that I made you uncomfortable, but I wanted to show off how cute you really are. I'm looking forward to where we are going next. The Auditorium!‶ Brooke said, </p><br><br><p>While snuggling in under Brooke's arm over her shoulder, Zoe could feel how excited Brooke seemed to be as they walked. The thought of being able to play on the piano again made her feel excited, too. Brooke was kind enough to stop when Zoe started feeling the pain in her legs. As the two walked, they spotted program participants getting hounded for requests. This caused Zoe to become fearful, so Brooke chose a different path to take Zoe where they didn't get as hounded.</p><br><br><p>The thought of getting hounded like those in the older grades reminded her that she had yet to receive a request. Though her thoughts were more innocent in that she thought it was because there were others for those requests, so they didn't need to do it. She was not aware that it was because of her sister's rep.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, the two found themselves in the Auditorium and Brooke led the way to the piano, Zoe remembered from Monday. ‶I got the placed prepared for us,‶ Brooke was saying, and Zoe saw the towel she'd placed there for Zoe. As Zoe sat on it, Brooke was still talking, ‶Ok, so Tracy said you haven't had previous piano lessons?‶ Brooke asked. Zoe blinked with a nod of her head. ‶That's a surprise cause the song you were playing on Monday was good. Can you play it again for me?‶ Brooke asked.</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded and started playing the song again from memory. ‶Huh, I don't know this song...‶ Brooke was saying as she neared the end of the song. ‶I, um, made it up,‶ Zoe confessed and heard the gasp in Brooke's voice as she spoke. ‶wow, really?!‶ Brooke asked, and as Zoe looked, she saw the proud smile on her face as the older teen sat beside her.</p><br><br><p>‶Yeah, I moved my fingers through the keys like this,‶ Zoe shows moving her fingers and making all the keys play a key sound. ‶Then I only chose, which sounded better to my ears,‶ Zoe explained.</p><br><br><p>Brooke looked at Zoe with admiration and respect. ‶Then you might have a special musical talent, which might mean you're a prodigy.‶ Brooke said and chuckled at a thought she had. ‶The Dancers are full of prodigies, huh?‶ She said before she explained, ‶Tracy is a prodigy when it comes to basketball. She just knows how to get the ball to the hoop. Next week, there's a game against another school, you'll see‶</p><br><br><p>Brooke got out a music book and turned it to the beginning page. ‶Here's what you'll need to know if you're joining the band,‶ she said. Unfortunately, she couldn't help but glance at Zoe's bare crotch. Zoe noticed her looking and glanced down as well. They saw that Zoe was damp around her private parts, and Brooke suspected because it was Brooke touching and being so near her.</p><br><br><p>‶Technically, I'm a teacher at the moment ... So, do you need relief?‶ Zoe squeaked like Brooke expected her to. ‶Zee, why don't you ask for it?‶ she asked her ‶C ... cause ... I'm scared of people touching, I ... I prefer only those I know well, but I don't want to ruin my friendship with Cecilia, and I thought Tracy would be uncomfortable... ‶ Zoe said amid stutters.</p><br><br><p>‶True, Tracy might be uncomfortable. I mean, she was very uncomfortable with you being naked. She thought it left you even more vulnerable. But she told me while we were getting food that you should accept relief, and since you said you'd prefer someone you know to do it, why not a boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a crush you might have?‶ Brooke told her.</p><br><br><p>Zoe frowned as she heard about Tracy worrying about her and feeling uncomfortable. ‶I don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, but I do have a crush ... but...‶ Her face was showing her blush now. ‶Why don't you ask them?‶ Brooke said as she learned new information.</p><br><br><p>‶I can't... ‶ Zoe said, looking down at her feet as shyness gripped her very being. Beside her, Brooke turned to face Zoe fully, as her still warm hands moved up to rest on the much younger teen's bare shoulders. ‶Zee, I'm not going to tease you, or be mean, but I am concerned over you not asking for relief, or doing anything sexual ... The Principal could make you repeat your week, or worse if you don't participate...‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe looked up at Brooke with a shocked expression on her face. Nervousness filled her again, as she did not want to repeat her week or the worse. She knew it would upset her sister, especially and hoped that the worse wouldn't be getting expelled.</p><br><br><p>‶It's you...‶ Zoe said after a while, ‶you're the one I have a crush on‶ Brooke didn't gasp in shock, instead she hugged Zoe closer, wrapping her arms around the younger, naked girl. This reaction surprised Zoe, and it was a proof of what Brooke had told her, that she won't tease her, or act in any way mean to her.</p><br><br><p>When she was released from the hug, she saw Brooke smiling. ‶I'm proud of you. You're so brave to tell me,‶ Brooke told her, then she moved back, tenderly pulling her forward before she gently pushed her so that Zoe was on her back. ‶You don't have to go as far as penetration, Zee, but touching with permission is allowed.‶ She'd say,‶ Zoe, may I show you how it feels to be touched by an expert?‶ Brooke asked with a kind smile.</p><br><br><p>It surprised Zoe as they pulled her forward, and then she found herself on her back. With her legs parted, and prevented to kick accidentally, she looked up at Brooke with genuine fear on her face. Of course, while there was fear, there was also curiosity</p><br><br><p>Zoe had heard from many sources how amazing sex felt, but she was not sure she would like it, though she wondered if it was because she hadn't been an expert. Brooke claimed to be an expert, and she had never known Brooke to lie. ‶Ok...‶ she said and saw the smile widen and saw her blowing on her hands, making sure they would be heated to the touch when she had.</p><br><br><p>Fear caused Zoe to close her eyes. Fear that the action Brooke was about to do was not something she wanted to see. However, the act of closing her eyes, dulling one of her senses caused an effect on her others, such as her sense of touch now greatly increased. The sense of Brooke touching her exploded throughout her body, as she felt warm hands touch her most sensitive parts, and working their way up slowly.</p><br><br><p>As the touching began, her body jerked at every touch that happened to her body. Because her eyes were closed she didn't expect it, and she couldn't help but moan softly ‶ohh...‶ before Brooke decided to stop torturing her and let her out of her misery.</p><br><br><p>She did this by attacking Zoe's clit with her hands, then with her mouth. Zoe screamed out in pleasure, ‶BROOKE!‶ and Zoe arched her back as the pleasure ran through her body and rewarded Brooke with Zoe's first official ejaculation. It coated Brooke's fingers, and her face, and a bit of the seat as Zoe collapsed as she rode this to its end, stunned at how she had felt, and indeed how Brooke brought her to her climax.</p><br><br><p>When nothing seemed to happen for a few minutes, she opened her eyes to Brooke, cleaning her face and hands with a Kleenex. Zoe widened her eyes. ‶I'm sorry!‶ Zoe said as she sat up, but only to be stopped by Brooke's hand. ‶Shh, it's ok! It's likely to happen, especially your first time. Anyway, stay put, I'll get us cleaned up, and then we can get back to practicing Piano unless you want to continue this?‶ Zoe nodded ‶Yeah, let's get back to Piano.‶ Brooke just chuckled and moved to get a new Kleenex to clean Zoe with.</p><br><br><p>Zoe watched as Brooke very carefully made sure they cleaned her up. The young teen thought she wouldn't be shocked if she released again, but because it seemed that her body was empty, she hadn't. Brooke helped her sit up once they finished cleaning her up and then turned to the piano.</p><br><br><p>Brooke showed her a song and pointed out the keys she should use, and watched her follow the notes with the piano keys. When ever Zoe looked at Brooke, she saw how Brooke was smiling, and wondered if she was proud of how skilled she seemed to be. A few times she had to nudge her when things seemed wrong, but overall, these seemed to be rare, and she heard her comment about how well she seemed to be.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was so fixated on playing the music that she barely registered Brooke's presence. Periodically, she'd feel it when an arm over her shoulder moved. Zoe was so fixated on her work, practicing a song a few times to memorize it. This continued, even as a new one was arranged before her and she'd practiced that one.</p><br><br><p>Brooke was all smiles as this happened and she watched her until the bell rang. ‶Oh, looks like school is over.‶ Brooke said as Zoe stopped and looked at her, ‶so now what?‶ ‶Date, dinner, and then we get to talking about the future like we are supposed to,‶ Brook replied.</p><br><br><p>The girls got off the bench, and Zoe grabbed the towel she'd been sitting and laying on. She noted the mess she left on it, from her sweat to the usual stuff that comes out of her. Today, as of that moment, there was something new on the towel, something that bothered her. Brooke sensed something causing her to take the towel from her as they walked out of the Auditorium. They walked to the back of the school, and Brooke tossed the towel into a laundry chute.</p><br><br><p>As they made their journey to the doors, they stopped at the sight of Sarah, the girl who got them parts in the school play. She had a male program participant with her, and from what the girls saw, she was touching his penis. It seemed to Zoe as if she was examining it, based on what she was telling him. ‶Looks perfect for the character I'm writing, thanks, Ben!‶ Sarah said, releasing him and watching him hurrying to go get dressed.</p><br><br><p>Brooke called to her ‶Hey Sarah!‶, causing her to turn and spot the two. ‶Hey Brooke! Hello Zoe! ‶ The young director, said. ‶I've been meaning to talk to you, but I think you forgot to tell us when the play is.‶ Brooke said, causing Sarah to widen her eyes and slapped her forehead. ‶I'm such a bonehead!, sorry It's tomorrow, at the start point of Fourth and ends when the fifth period does. We got a good costume for you, and we will tie Zoe up. I've been talking to Tracy, who told me about her condition, so I'll be careful.‶ Zoe nodded. Though she was a little scared of being tied up, she was certain things would be fine.</p><br><br><p>Brooke led Zoe out the doors and headed towards her car. Zoe overheard gossip that during the week, Brooke had gotten her driver's license and her permit. She also heard rather than buy a new car which was expensive, her cousin had given her, her old car.</p><br><br><p>As they came to it, Zoe thought it still looked neat and cool looking, almost a sports car in a way. With a press of a button, the car unlocked, and Brooke opened the door for her naked companion. Zoe saw a towel over her seat as they helped her into the car.</p><br><br><p>They placed the seatbelt over her body before the doors were closed. Once Brooke got in, she grinned at Zoe before speaking. ‶Next stop Fun World!‶ Zoe couldn't help but squeal, because she'd always wanted to go to Fun World, but her family couldn't afford it.</p><br><br><p>Zoe watched as Brooke started the car and took them out of the parking lot. ‶I spoke to Tracy the other day, and your parents the other day,‶ she started.</p><br><br><p>‶They mentioned their desire to take you and your sister there, but couldn't afford to.‶ She said before she added,‶ During her program week, I'd taken Tracy there on a date, but because of your doctor's appointment, we couldn't take you. I promised her I would take you somehow when we could, again and then I remembered this, the day 11th graders picked a 9th grader to talk to them.‶ She said and smiled as she added, ‶My family runs the park, and I'd heard that today they were doing maintenance, but around now they'd be done, so I asked if they could keep the park closed for us and they agreed. I've also arranged for a park cart to be waiting for us so we won't have to walk to all the rides.Brooke said.</p><br><br><p>Hearing how thoughtful Brooke had been in her planning made Zoe smile. Brooke was right. Zoe had always wanted to go to Fun World, and to go on the rides, but was always upset that they couldn't because of expenses. Now that she was in the program, she also started thinking about the fact that it might be better to be naked. Zoe had read all about the rides and things that could be done, and as a result, being naked was better, with fewer chances to get clothes wet.</p><br><br><p>At a red light, Brooke took a brochure from the glove box and handed it to her. ‶Take a look, and I'll see if we can get to the rides you actually want to try.‶ She said and Zoe looked at the brochure, ignoring the outside world as she did so.</p><br><br><p>‶I don't know what to choose. They all seem exciting.‶ Zoe told her as she looked through the brochure. A lot of the attractions shown were ones she'd seen online. ‶Ok, the Ferris Wheel, Splash Town, and Slime Zilla? Wait, is that a horror ride?‶ Zoe asked, and noticed Brooke smiled.</p><br><br><p>‶Not so much horror as messy. The ride slam through this slimy stuff, getting us covered in it. We could do that one, it won't hurt us, so no worries, but before the other rides we can get a shower, something I'd love to do with you,‶ Brooke said, and Zoe nodded, the slime Zilla ride caught her attention. But what had caught her interest was the idea of showering with Brooke.</p><br><br><p>‶Also, we'll need to cover our holes, though,‶ Brooke said as the girls soon arrived at the parking lot of Fun World. Brooke's words caused Zoe to blink her eyes in confusion. ‶What do you mean our holes?' she asked as she got out and saw the trunk open, causing her to move to the back. Brooke was removing her shirt, followed by her pants and everything else to be naked like Zoe was. This caused Zoe to gasp as she saw her crush naked for the first time. ‶I'm not in the program, so, in town, it would be a problem, but this place? My family owns it, and owners can decide if they want to let customers be naked even though they aren't in the program. I'd also discussed that with my family, too.‶ She told her and added, ‶Also, so you know, my personal rule for dates is to join you for everything, so no matter what rides I'll be beside you,‶ she added.</p><br><br><p>Zoe didn't respond as she got a good look. Her crush was naked in front of her, and gosh, she was in love with her body. Brooke smiled at her and held out her hand, which Zoe took and followed her to the entrance to Fun World. There, they met up with a man dressed as an employee. ‶Afternoon, Ms. Almastein! I have the cart ready for you!‶ The Employee said as he led the way to the cart. ‶Since you both will be naked, I took the liberty of making sure you had towels.‶ He added, showing the towels on the seats behind the driver's seat.</p><br><br><p>‶Thank you, I appreciated that!‶ Brooke said and helped Zoe into her seat and got into the other one. Zoe wondered how well trained Brooke's family's park employees were, as this one didn't seem to bat an eye that there were two naked girls there.</p><br><br><p>‶Alright, where do you want to go first, Zee?‶ Brooke asked, though she got a feeling she knew precisely what she wanted to do first.</p><br><br><p>‶Slime Zilla, I'm sorry I can't help it. I want to see what that's about,‶ Zoe replied, and the driver chuckled. He started the cart, and drove them down a road made for it, before the three came to what looked like a cave entrance. The driver parked the cart and Brooke and Zoe walked into the cave. They found it more high tech in there in terms of a room where they saw the attraction's car on one side and a big screen.</p><br><br><p>As they walked, Zoe felt as if their feet pressed a pressure plate.</p><br><br><p>The screen activated, and a balding man with a military uniform appeared. ‶Team, this is it, a last-ditch effort against the monster. Reports came in that it destroyed Base Alpha, which prevents the use of missiles like before. But I have good news to share with you. We have a new prototype! You will have to ride in it and take it into the monster!‶</p><br><br><p>Beside her, Zoe heard Brooke giggling softly. ‶Uncle Bob looks so cool dressed like that!‶ Before she led Zoe to the ride-car and took a seat at the front. Brooke sat, making sure her legs were closed tight, making sure that Zoe followed her example. The Ride quickened its pace, and then the surrounding walls disappeared as it came out, and the wall covering the ride also disappeared, exposing them further.</p><br><br><p>The Slime Monster before them was giant sized, and very gooey. It seemed as if it was on some kind of building, and its goo was oozing down the building's sides. As the car came closer, Zoe saw a large hole, but goo was flowing over it.</p><br><br><p>The ride car slammed into the hole, penetrating this barrier that felt like a bubble to her. It continued inside, submerging itself into the slimy goo, and the girls getting covered in goo. The car continued moving as it brought the now slimed girls out of the creature and then to the station. Some of the slimes got into her mouth because she screamed, and although she found the slime tasty, but she wasn't sure she should be eating it so she tried not to swallow.</p><br><br><p>The ride came to a complete stop inside, and the first sounds she could hear was Brooke giggling. ‶Oh, Zoe, the look on your face was adorable!‶ This caused Zoe to blush as Brooke climbed out and then helped Zoe, to keep her steady. As they got off the ride another big screen with Brooke's Uncle Bob appears again. But this time, there was a party behind him. ‶Team, you did it, you made the ultimate sacrifice, and your country thanks you!‶ Brooke led the way to the left where there were signs that showed a shower.</p><br><br><p>The two headed into the showers, and Zoe watched as Brooke activated them, and saw the slime fall off of her hands. Zoe started moving forward, and Brooke guided her into the showers. Zoe watched as the warm water sprayed all over her, pushing the goo off of her, as she felt hands touching her, scrubbing and assisting in the cleaning.</p><br><br><p>She thought Brooke was very thorough in cleaning her, which caused her to smile at how kind she was.</p><br><br><p>‶Hey, my skin feels smooth, much more so than before,‶ Zoe said as she ran a finger along her arm. ‶It's the slime; since there was a high percent a park goer would be naked. They added the solution to the slime, so it doesn't stain, but would instead help the skin.‶ Brooke told her ‶it's still bad if it gets into our vaginas, of course, but on the skin it's good,‶ she said.</p><br><br><p>Brooke soon stepped from behind Zoe's butt, which was fully cleaned of slime, and then moved around the younger girl, checking to see if there was still slime on her body. ‶Looks like you're clean now. How about we get Splash Town out of the way, and then, we'll sit in a Ferris Wheel?‶ Zoe nodded her head ‶sounds good,‶ Brooke nodded ‶then we need to go have supper, and either have some more fun or go somewhere else and talk, I mean we still need to have a future discussion after all.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded, ‶and since this is technically a school activity, then ... I gotta stay naked, don't I?‶ she asked and sadly, Brooke had to nod her head. ‶Don't worry ... We'll go where I know we will be safe.‶ Brooke told her as she began leading Zoe to the doors out of the attraction. As they made it out, they winced at the bright sunlight.</p><br><br><p>The two rode the cart to another part of the park, the attraaction here seemed bigger to Zoe. The artwork at the front of the attraction had a picture of a flooded city. Brooke led her inside, but unlike before, the two had to sit in separate boats. Zoe noticed that there was a steering wheel, and other instruments which caused the boat to move a little.</p><br><br><p>The younger teen thought the game was a little like bumper cars, which she'd seen on the way. But the only difference was that they were on boats.</p><br><br><p>Fortunately, the water wasn't deep, so those who couldn't swim won't drown. Zoe was the first to climb into a green boat, while Brooke entered a red one. They were soon released into the attraction, and they sped around. Zoe discovered the boats could cause the water to splash, so as they drove the boats, they tried to cause the water to splash. They also spent time trying to ram the boats and knock the other into the water.</p><br><br><p>Zoe grinned as she tried to splash Brooke purposefully with the water. ‶Oh, you, I'll get you back for that, Zee!‶ Brooke responded, but Zoe only giggled as she passed and tried to make the boat stay ahead of Brooke, but with the layout design that was a little hard to do.</p><br><br><p>She had to cross through alleyways and duck through skywalks as she tried to dodge Brooke. Her body shook with laughter, and as it did, her breasts jiggled. She didn't know it, but Brooke was trying to make it enjoyable for Zoe. It absolutely was working, and Zoe was showing Brooke things about the boat she didn't know it could do, such as spin in place to force the water to splash.</p><br><br><p>Finally, the girls got severely soaked. ‶You really got me good,‶ Brooke said with a wet grin as the boat came up beside Zoe's boat. ‶Yup, so did you! This is really fun! It's like bumper cars only on water!‶</p><br><br><p>‶Want to continue, or get dry?‶ Brooke asked with a grin on her face. ‶Let's get dry, because I am getting kinda cold, honestly. And I'd like to go on the Ferris Wheel, before supper.‶ Brooke nodded and guided the boats to their dock and climbed up onto it. Brooke grabbed hold of Zoe's hands and pulled her up onto the dock, which was soon wet from the water dripping.</p><br><br><p>The two walked into a transition area of the attraction which was instantly warm, and Brooke grabbed a towel and wrapped it around Zoe's body. She tenderly rubbed with the towel which caused the water to get removed from the outside of Zoe's body. Brooke focused on Zoe, making sure she was hot and dry. Though, when she got to the lower half of the 9th grader's body, she sent up a wave of pleasure as she came to Zoe's nether region.</p><br><br><p>‶ooh...‶ Zoe couldn't help but say after the feelings subsided. The noises caused Brooke to glance up at her before she realized what happened. She smiled with a look of apology. ‶Sorry about that, Zee!‶ With Zoe's body now dry and warm, Brooke wrapped the towel around Zoe's hair, since it will be harder to dry it.</p><br><br><p>Brooke then took another towel and was about to use it on herself, when Zoe took it from her and began using it to dry Brooke, as Brooke had done. Brooke was all smiles as she watched the sweet young girl dry her with the towel. Zoe tried to be careful, but like what Brooke had done, she too caused pleasure to shoot up Brooke's body as Brooke had done.</p><br><br><p>Then Brooke had to crouch a little so that she could wrap the towel around her head, and the two walked out, once more into the sun, where they got the ride to the Ferris Wheel part of Fun World.</p><br><br><p>Zoe took the seat to the right of the door, moving to the windows immediately, while Brooke sat across from her. The Driver became the attraction operator, and they were soon lifted into the air. ‶Wow! That view is neat!‶ Zoe said as she began being able to see their hometown, as well as the landscape. Brooke just smiled as she watched Zoe's reaction. ‶Yeah, it's cool, huh?' She asked as the pod reached the top of the Wheel and stopped. After a few minutes, they heard a voice on the intercom inside the pod. ‶Sorry Miss Almastein, there is a slight issue, but don't worry, it's going to be quick!‶ said their driver.</p><br><br><p>‶Well ... since there's a delay... ‶ Zoe said. ‶I liked your programming class because it seemed neat, and, I'd like to ask the staff in the Student offices if I can take it next year. Because I'd like to be a programmer, as a job in the future.‶ Brooke smiled as she listened to her talk and nodded. ‶That would be an amazing job, though there is a difference between computer programming and game programming. I did some research some time ago, essentially to see what I wanted to specialize in. Computer programmers make approximately 98,640 per year, and 45.98 per hour, while video game programmers make $83,479 each year they work. Based on my research, I decided to go for computer programming. Although my choice was basically because of the ten dollars extra, it was also because I want to make computers from the very scratch. I'd love the idea of making a computer for you to use, for homework you need to write.‶ Brooke told her, as Zoe listened attentively with an interested smile. ‶I'd love a computer, but my parents once said that they were working on getting me one, but because of their schedules, they couldn't take me to the store.‶</p><br><br><p>Brooke grinned as she listened to Zoe talk before she added. ‶I think I might be able to help with that, though I should ask your parents if it's OK,‶ she said as excitement filled the young girls. Zoe grinned as she began realizing something. ‶So, was that the talk we were supposed to have, or is there more?‶ She asked her fellow naturist, ‶Well, we established what you want to do, so my next duty is to contact the staff and let them know. Plus, if you go to this programming class next semester, we might have a class next year together,‶ Zoe smiled. ‶Oh, that would be amazing!‶</p><br><br><p>Brooke couldn't help to smile as she watched Zoe's response. Brooke remembered what Zoe had said about having a crush on her and knew this was also what was influencing her response. Zoe soon found herself sitting beside Brooke, who had her arm over her shoulder. Now skin to skin contact was affecting the younger girl, but she felt safe in Brooke's arms... </p><br><br><p>When the pod began moving, signaling the issue was fixed, the girl's bodies jerked against each other, causing skin to skin contact and breast to breast contact. Their breasts jiggled in addition to this movement, but the girl's attention was largely outside as the pod came down gently. This allowed them to see a clock that was showing 4:50, which meant they should get going for supper.</p><br><br><p>‶Zee, if you'd like to stay naked, we'll go straight to supper, and I'll stay naked with you, if not I'll take you straight home so you can get dressed, how's that sound?‶ Brooke asked her and waited patiently for her answer. ‶Well, I am getting kinda hungry so ... let's go straight to supper ... er, where are we going?‶ Zoe replied.</p><br><br><p>‶You'll see,‶ Brooke said with a smile, and then when the pod came to a complete stop, the two left the pod and walked to the cart, and they were returned to Brooke's car. ‶Later on, when things are open to the public, we can come back for the full experience.‶ She said, and the two got into the car and drove on the road.</p><br><br><p>Zoe noticed when Brooke was turning the car, and soon saw the great river, and a picnic table. ‶Stay put a sec,‶ Brooke said, and hurried out of the car and moved to the back. Zoe strained her body, trying to turn and watch as she took a black package, which she brought to the table. Zoe watched her open and started setting something up. The last thing she noticed seemed to be a candle which was placed in the center and soon lit up.</p><br><br><p>This allowed some light in the darkening environment around them. Brooke hurried back to the car, to Zoe's side, which was soon opened. ‶Dinner is ready!‶ She told her before bringing her to the table, and sets her onto the toweled seating. ‶Mom helped me with dinner, and I tried to make it as romantic as it was when I took your sister.‶ She told Zoe, and handed over the utensils for both of them to eat.</p><br><br><p>‶We went here, and we could see that view and just listen to it all,‶ Brooke added and then began mixing her food a little and began eating her food as Zoe followed suit. ‶Unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding, and when Tracy was given the card and told she'd be naked for outreach. She thought that the School was telling her she had to be naked the whole week, even outside of it, unless she was home. She didn't want to be naked in front of you, since she was worried that it might affect you, but Tracy was a rule follower. I took her here, and like today it was just her, me, and the driver to take us to the attractions. I don't know if she said, but I hope she had fun here, even though she was naked.‶ Brooke said and then glanced at the silent Zoe.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was silent as she processed the information she was told. She did recall, though barely a conversation her parents had with Tracy last year. It was something about fun. Could this have been it? She wasn't sure if it was, but she hoped she had fun. ‶Yeah, I think she had fun ... I remembered her saying something about fun.‶ Brooke smiled in response before Zoe continued speaking. ‶I think I got used to being naked outside the bathroom and my room...‶ she said to Brooke after a brief pause.</p><br><br><p>Broke smiled in response. ‶I've noticed you don't seem to want to cover up as much,‶ she commented. The comment caused Zoe to blush in embarrassment. They ate their meal, and the girls watched the river, taking note of the reflection on the surface.</p><br><br><p>Brooke was the first to finish, so she waited for Zoe to finish, too. ‶So, what do you want to do next?‶ she asked her. Zoe blinked ‶Not sure ... Normally after supper, I go do homework, and then watch tv, but since I was hanging with you, I don't have homework. I wish we could go back to school so that I could see more programming, but school is likely closed by now. Hehe, but I'm enjoying our time together!‶ Zoe said with a smile.</p><br><br><p>Brooke listened and smiled with pleasure that Zoe was enjoying her time with Brooke. ‶True, school is closed for the day, but we could go to my place. I also have a similar program there, as the school has. I was enjoying it so much I wanted to do more at home, so the teacher told me where I could get the program. I got it at home installed and ready for me to tinker with. We could go there and my parents are at work, and I am an only child, so no siblings either. We'd be alone.‶ Brooke said, before adding, ‶It's just as nice there as here too,‶ Her statement ended with a grin.</p><br><br><p>Zoe smiled at her, ‶then we should go! Although ... Should we make a stop at my home so I can get dressed? I mean, if we do, then we won't need towels ... But ... The dates are technically a school activity too ... Drat!‶ She blushed. Brooke moved over to give her a hug, ‶hey, it's ok, I understand how you feel, and honestly, one of my favorite writers, once said, that nudity was a sign of purity. Though it was actually about a kid, but you're pure and adorable. If you want to go home we could, it's ok.‶</p><br><br><p>Zoe blushed at the compliments, but thought perhaps it would be better to get home and get dressed before she even thought of going anywhere. ‶Let's go to my home, to get dressed, then we can go...‶ Brooke nodded, and then got up, and led Zoe to the car, and both got into the car and made the journey back to the Dancer Family home.</p><br><br><p>On arrival, they saw Jill's car, which they easily recognized. ‶Oh, Jill might be picking Cecilia up!‶ Zoe said when they saw Jill's car and easily recognized it. They parked the car and walked to the door. Zoe unlocked it after getting her key from her bag. ‶Hey!‶ She said as she walked in, to Jill, Cecilia, Tracy, and her parents. They each had a frown on their faces when they turned to look over. Though the frowns turned to shock when they saw Brooke was naked. ‶Hey, I didn't want her to feel alone,‶ she explained with a grin as the two girls stepped up.</p><br><br><p>Zoe hugged her friend before she blushed as she remembered she was naked. ‶Sorry about that!‶ She said before she noticed they were frowning at her. ‶I'll go get dressed, be right back!‶ ‶Wait!‶ Said Cecilia, causing Zoe to turn and look back. ‶The vice principal ... phoned your parents‶ Zoe blinked in shock. ‶but ... but I have never committed a crime! And I am passing my classes too! I've never even said a rude thing to anyone!‶ Tears fell from her eyes, causing Cecilia to hug her.</p><br><br><p>‶Honey, it's because you haven't been accepting relief. You need a sexual experience as part of the program to participate...‶ Zoe didn't respond, but Brooke spoke up ‶Actually ... About that,‶ which was met with multiple huh's from the other girls. ‶The reason Zoe hasn't been trying to take part in that is that she is scared of people who she doesn't know touching her, I mean understandable ... But the only person she'd be comfortable doing that is Cecilia, me, and Tracy, but she thought Cecilia wouldn't be comfortable, and the same with Tracy.‶ Brooke explained.</p><br><br><p>‶That's bullshit! Of course, I'd be willing. You're my best friend! And if it keeps you from getting in trouble, I'll do it!‶ Cecilia said. Brooke nodded. ‶OK, Cecily will be the second time in which Zoe will get relief, and I think that will be it. The rules don't say she can't only get relief from one person, so it should be fine, but tomorrow in my meeting I'll mention it to the principals. I'll also make sure the student office people know about a potential class, too.‶ She said.</p><br><br><p>‶Potential class? I know she'll have History but what's the potential class?‶ Tracy asked Brooke, ‶Programming the same one I take.‶ Zoe's mothers smiled, pleased with the choice. ‶Anyway, it's time for us to leave. Mom will want Cecilia home in time for chores and talk about her day. ‶Jill said as Cecilia gave her naked best friend another hug. ‶Seriously, go for relief, it will be good for you,‶ Cecilia told her friend, and with that, Jill and Cecilia left. Nicole turned to her daughters. ‶What about you two?‶ She asked, ‶I have homework I need to catch up on. And I need to prepare myself for when me and Brooke go to talk to the principals.‶ Tracy said. ‶Brooke does too, I bet, but Brooke invited me to come to her house. She has a program on her computer and she mentioned showing off a bit and teaching me a little for next semester,‶ Zoe said.</p><br><br><p>Brooke nodded ‶I could show her and teach her until 8:30, and bring her back home, no worries. Plus Zoe will have the play tomorrow in the afternoon too. She'll need to be well rested for that,‶ Brooke said with a sm‶ Nicole and Kelly spoke about it, and in the end, they decided to agree. There was still time until curfew.</p><br><br><p>Zoe turned to walk to her room, ‶Where are you going?‶ Kelly asked. ‶My room, I need to get dressed. All official school activities are over, so I don't need to stay naked.‶ She told her mother.</p><br><br><p>‶I'd rather Zoe feel comfortable, so I don't mind if she's dressed,‶ Brooke said. After all, it was naked in school, not naked at crush's house. At least as far as she was concerned, plus she wasn't a teacher affiliated with the school, so there was no reason for Zoe to be naked. Zoe returned wearing a beautiful white skirt and a blouse to match with white songs, which were soon placed in her shoes. Soon, Brooke and Zoe were on the road again, Brooke like Zoe was also dressed, having fished out her clothes.</p><br><br><p>The trip took no time at all, and they were soon at Brooke's family home. Brooke led the way up to her room and got Zoe to sit down, and booted her computer up before eventually double-clicking on the program she mentioned.</p><br><br><p>‶You saw how complex the program at school was, and that's just a 10-minute video, here's a shorter one‶ Brooke spent a few minutes typing something down and then pressed the button which caused the program to create a new video.</p><br><br><p>‶Zoe is the cutest girl in the entire world! She's so sweet and kind!‶ Was the video shown with a cute art of Zoe ‶What do you think?‶ Brooke asked her. ‶That's sweet! That is what I think!‶ Zoe said with a blush. Brooke smiled at Zoe's response ‶The class you're in will probably start with the videos, and the really complex stuff, like creating new programs, actual programs will be in college or university, then it's whatever company hires you. From what I hear, if you get a license or something for programming, a lot of the tech companies would want to hire you,‶ Brooke tells her.</p><br><br><p>Brooke showed Zoe a simple code that anyone can easily do, and then let her repeat the coding. She smiled as she watched it get created into a program. Eventually, the clock ticked on and as they had fun coding; the time passed until Brooke realized that she needed to take Zoe home. So the two left Brooke's house, returned to the car and then drove to Zoe's, after which Zoe hugged Brooke and said goodbye to her and she went to the bathroom, got a shower, and then went to bed as did the others.</p>"

        title: "Friday",
        content: "<p>As the young teen sat up and yawned, she couldn't help but realize with some glee and happiness that it was Friday. Friday typically would have meant that it was the weekend tomorrow, but because she was in the program, it meant that today would be her last day. She also remembered that the play was today too and that she'd be the princess being rescued by Brooke. She yawned a last time, after which she opened her eyes to once more spot her sister.</p><br><br><p>Zoe smiled at her sister before she got up and hugged her. Once that was done, she moved to the bathroom. The toilet was her first stop in the bathroom. Here she pulled her pajamas off and tossed them into the laundry hamper before she moved into the shower.</p><br><br><p>While showering, her thoughts returned to the program she was participating in. Her thoughts soon evolved towards how it could be changed to be better, but she was certain that her ideas wouldn't be liked since she didn't like the sexual aspect of the program.</p><br><br><p>Slight pain brought her out of her thoughts, and realizing that the soap she'd lathered on herself was gone, she turned the water off and returned to the toilet. This allowed her to rest her feet and get herself dry from the shower before getting dried. ‶Zoe! Breakfast is ready!‶ Her mother called, ‶I'll be right there!‶ Zoe replied before she got up and walked out of the bathroom. <i>One more day</i>, she thought, <i>one more day and I'll be clothed forever.</i> Zoe had gotten used to going to school naked, but she would be happy to be clothed again.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe arrived, she took a seat beside her sister, who was once more naked, as her mother Nicole had been. Nicole and Tracy were both placing plates that were holding their breakfast waffles onto the table. Nicole brought their milk over for the three to enjoy.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe ate, Tracy and Nicole began conversing and that, as well as their eating, made the time fly past them. As soon as Zoe finished, she went directly to the living room, since there was no point in her getting dressed, unlike her mother and sister, who had left her to do so.</p><br><br><p>Zoe spent some time switching channels until she found one that showed a show she liked. Movement behind her brought her attention to Tracy's return, and the two watched together quietly, save for giggles during the hilarious parts.</p><br><br><p>The arrival of their mother soon brought an end to their watching, and a signal that it was time to go, so they went to the family car, and the journey to their high school began. The travel took almost an hour, and as they arrived, the girls spotted Brook with their other friends.</p><br><br><p>‶Hey, Princess!‶ Brooke greeted with a grin on her face. Of course, Brooke remembered about the play today. Though being called a princess had caused her to blush with embarrassment even as her sister commented on the new nickname. ‶Princess, I like it!‶ Tracy had said with a sound of a giggle even as she hugged her younger sister. With a wave to their departing mother, the sisters turned back to the group that had moved to a new spot that allowed for seating to be used.</p><br><br><p>‶Ok, my second class is with Tracy since she wants to kidnap me for her art class, so the first and third will be normal. ‶ Zoe said to herself, but Brooke grinned as she listened. ‶If you'd like I could kidnap you again, oh, which reminds me, after the play, I'm going to be grabbing you to come with for your new outfit fitting.‶ Brooke said before she turned to the others, ‶So Zoe and I will meet you all by the doors.‶ Tracy and the others nodded their heads along with various styles of ‶Ok‶ was also said.</p><br><br><p>The thought of the outfit got her concerns, and paranoia raised. She couldn't help but wonder what precisely would the outfit be and what would they getting her to wear. The young teen hoped the outfit wasn't anything considered sexy. Zoe didn't think she could pull that kind of outfit off. Slowly, as she thought to herself, her hand moved up to her hair, which sadly was in a bit of a mess since she couldn't restyle it in the same style as the one she received yesterday.</p><br><br><p>Brooke, who was watching her, noted her actions and nodded her head.</p><br><br><p>As the girls conversed with each other, Brooke moved behind her, and diligently worked to get her hair back in the same style as yesterday. This caused smiles to form on the other's faces as they watched. Soon Zoe's hair was back in that beautiful new style, and just in time for the bell to ring, signalling the start of school. This meant that, for the most part, the girls had to separate.</p><br><br><p>Zoe and Cecilia walked together hand in hand to their first period class. ‶Remember what we talked about last night?‶ Cecilia asked her, which caused Zoe to blush at the memory. The teen nodded, though she couldn't believe that she might actually need relief.</p><br><br><p>Zoe knew that she was supposed to participate, but at the moment she wasn't aroused as far as she knew.</p><br><br><p>When she arrived at her and Cecilia's first period, she didn't ask because she didn't think she needed it. Then again, she also didn't think she ever got aroused. This caused Cecilia to sigh and shook her head. From what Cecilia had been told, Zoe had been eating and watching TV while she was naked, and now that it was their first period class, Zoe's best friend hoped she needed relief, but she also hoped that the relief Brooke gave her yesterday would be enough for the principal and vice principal.</p><br><br><p>Zoe, on the other hand, was focused on her English Assignment. But as she glanced over to Cecilia, she noticed she was typing something which reminded her. Tracy, Cecilia and a few others were using a special chat app.</p><br><br><p>Cecilia was tattling on her to her sister, or also the group chat. Zoe tried to focus on her class assignment, answering questions from the book they had been reading. The thought that she would be finished before the class ended caused a smile to form. Unfortunately, because she was being stolen in her second period, she would have math homework. She chose not to let it bother her, as she would have had math homework, anyway.</p><br><br><p>Eventually the bell rang, and as she looked down, she found that she'd been right that she was done before the bell. This caused a grin to appear on her lips.</p><br><br><p>Zoe packed up her things before she glanced at the door, where she spotted her sister. This caused another smile to form as she greeted her sister again. ‶Hiya sis, I'm ready to, uh, help you with your class!‶ She said with a smile on her face. Tracy smiled a little in response to her sister's words. ‶Awesome, I am glad to hear that!‶ She said as the two soon separated from Cecilia, who was going to math, which was down the opposite hall while Tracy and Zoe would head to Mr. Barr's class.</p><br><br><p>‶So ... You didn't ask for relief?‶ Tracy asked, confirming what Zoe had thought, that Cecilia had tattled on her. Then again, who knew how many students in their class were a part of the network? Zoe decided to be honest with her sister. ‶N ... No, I thought I needed to if I felt aroused and I didn't...‶ she told her. Tracy was frowning, but had said nothing, allowing Zoe to think silently, and discover mentally how she might be an introvert since she didn't seek out sex, which made it not occur to her to think about it... </p><br><br><p>Zoe would be lying if she didn't admit that what Brooke had done yesterday had felt amazing to her, but she didn't think she needed to seek it out.</p><br><br><p>As she and her sister walked to class, Zoe leaned against her sister, a result of a habit that developed when she and Cecilia walked together. Tracy seemed to expect this, and had moved her arm over her shoulder, which seemed to steady her. Nobody bothered them most of the time as they went. No student asked for reasonable requests.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, the two made it to the art class, where a man was setting up the class for his students. There was a seat in front of one of the Easel stands. ‶Ah, I take it she's Zoe?‶ Mr. Barr asked Tracy, who nodded. ‶Yup, also like I mentioned yesterday, I'd also like to go double, since Zoe is also someone I care for very much,‶ she said. Mr. Barr nodded his head, and they guided Zoe to sit down.</p><br><br><p>Now seated, Zoe took a moment to examine the seating. It seemed almost like it might be memory foam lined cushioned, which made it very comfortable to sit on. She also saw that there was a towel, which reminded her that she'd forgotten hers in class.</p><br><br><p>Zoe's attention went to the doors as the students entered the class, but she saw they didn't seem to pay attention to her, or even notice her there. Zoe soon thought that because it was Art Class, they were used to naked people, which included the 11th grader program participant in the class whose name escaped her. When she was spotted by the 11th grader, she quickly looked down out of fear of scorn... </p><br><br><p>‶Alright class, you'll notice we have another nude model here, which is only for Tracy to work on. Everyone else will be using their minds to make their art. ‶ Mr. Barr told the class, and then glanced to Zoe before he turned to Tracy. ‶Tracy, it looks like she may need relief. I'd like you to give her pleasure so that she can ejaculate her juices.‶ He said before the class reacted. ‶But she's her sister!‶ They were saying as Tracy gasped in shock and surprise.</p><br><br><p>Regarding the odd rules of the program, the teacher was well within his rights to make such a decision. However, he'd overheard Brooke's conversation with the principal, and felt that since Tracy was the only one she knew in the room, he thought was best to let Tracy take care of things.</p><br><br><p>Tracy stepped up towards her sister, blocking the view of the others as Zoe looked up at her with fear in her eyes. Tracy shifted her eyes and by that extension her sight towards her crotch and saw how wet she was down there. Her elder sister knelt before her, and with tenderness and love, she moved her sister's legs apart, and gently she touches Zoe's privates, with a gentle rubbing on the entrance until she reached what some call the clit. She knew what she was touching, and she knew exactly what to do here, as she continued to tease that as well.</p><br><br><p>Zoe's eyes closed at the touch, and as the sensitive part of her was affected, she began to ejaculate. Unfortunately, Tracy would soon get more than girl cum on her hands, because, in second period is normally when her bladder tells her she needed to go to the bathroom. This meant that besides girl cum, she also accidentally peed on her sister.</p><br><br><p>Fortunately, Tracy's teacher had the class's attention, so they didn't notice, but Tracy had noticed it. Tracy moved to wash her hands and brought a wet cloth to clean Zoe with and a new towel for her to sit on before Tracy got to her assignment. Zoe's embarrassment caused her to keep her head down, as her mind processed what happened, and the realization that as time passed she hadn't felt the need to go to the bathroom.</p><br><br><p>Zoe continued to sit there, though she'd had to change into a unique position. She tried to smile, but unfortunately, she wasn't feeling particularly happy. Finally, Tracy turned to speak to Mr. Barr, and say that she was done with her art assignment. Zoe saw a pair of legs walk around her, heading to where Tracy was, and heard him say he liked it. In addition, since she was also using the art as part of her second assignment, the two of them had free time until the bell rang for the third period.</p><br><br><p>Zoe didn't see Tracy nodding her head before her familiar feet moved to the seat beside her where she sat. Zoe felt hands, warm hands, rubbing her back, bringing her attention up to her elder sister. Tracy smiled kindly at her, before she spoke, after taking her younger sister's hands in hand. ‶Come on, let's go,‶ Tracy had told her, and Zoe followed her silently, not sure where they were going.</p><br><br><p>As time passed, she recognized the hallway, and saw the words on a door, they were approaching, saying the girl's locker room. Tracy continued to lead her through the quiet, empty room until they got to the shower area for the sports teams. ‶Let's give you a better shower than what I was able to do,‶ Tracy said as she got the stuff ready, before she removed her clothes and led her sister into the showers proper.</p><br><br><p>Tracy spoke as she got the body wash from the shelf. ‶Since the bathrooms are nearby, we can stop there if you need to.‶ But having accidentally peed, Zoe shook her twin tail-styled head. ‶I don't need to,‶ she said in a quieter tone of voice that was enhanced by the room's ambiance. ‶Ah, because you peed on my hand?‶ Tracy asked her as she lathered up the school's loofa. Zoe said nothing in response, but she heard something that sounded like her sister saying, ah thought so.</p><br><br><p>Tracy lathered her sister up and guided her to the shower to wash it down, and made sure the shower paid more attention to her sister's crotch than anything else. After her sister's care, Tracy dried Zoe, and then hugged her. Zoe took that moment to speak, ‶‶I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to! I was just so distracted.‶ This seemed to cause Tracy to hug her tight, as she replied to her. ‶Hey, it's ok, I'm not mad. We'll keep this as our secret, OK?‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy knew that Zoe was embarrassed about it so she thought they should keep it to each other.</p><br><br><p>Zoe nodded, as she was entirely fine with that. She didn't like the idea of telling people she urinated on her sister's hand. With the topic change, the girls talked about the fun things. Though Zoe had spoke about her day yesterday at home, Tracy was still interested in talking about it. Tracy had been proud when Brooke mentioned that Zoe had a talent when it came to music. Zoe smiled as Tracy laughed about how there were two prodigies in the family.</p><br><br><p>Zoe also mentioned having found out about Tracy being a captain of the basketball team. This time, it was Tracy's turn to blush. Brooke was right. Tracy didn't enjoy bragging about her basketball team position.</p><br><br><p>‶hey sis, I've been thinking ... About my time in the program.‶ Zoe started, causing Tracy to look over. ‶Oh? I thought we talked about everything. Is there anything new you want to talk about?‶ Tracy asked her with a smile. ‶Well ... I can't remember if it was third or second period, but Monday, as me and Cecilia left, we heard some boys talk about asking me for unreasonable requests, and one boy mentioned not wanting to get stabbed ... I didn't understand what he meant...‶</p><br><br><p>Tracy's smile was gone instantly. ‶I know what he was talking about ... damn... ‶ She placed her hand on her head. ‶Do I have a secret guardian angel protecting my purity or something?‶ Zoe asked, causing Tracy to chuckle.</p><br><br><p>‶Something like that ... But I think we should talk about this at home, with our parents.‶ Tracy said finally. ‶I think it would be better if we do it then.‶ She said eventually. Zoe nodded, thinking that would be a good idea. Then As if to signal the end of the conversation, the bell rang, and Tracy took Zoe to her third period. ‶You're going with Brooke after lunch, so don't go to your fourth or fifth-period class.‶ Tracy reminded her before leaving her sister.</p><br><br><p>In Friday's science class, the 9th graders had to dissect a frog. It was an act disturbing to Zoe, but fortunately, Cecilia was her partner, and they were able to get it done. They had to write and label the parts they saw on the worksheet after opening the frog for viewing. It felt odd to Zoe, being a naked person, and doing the cutting part of the discussion. But she helped her partner by pointing out the organs. While a Frog wasn't human, she thought that the placement of the organs were similar to where humans had it.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, the bell rang for lunch, so Zoe got herself cleaned up and went with Cecilia to the cafeteria, where they reunited with their sisters and their sister's friends. They soon found their seats, and Tracy, Cecilia, Jill, Jan, and Brooke left to get their food, as well as some food for Zoe. As they returned, she saw they were talking to each other, and soon included her in their conversation.</p><br><br><p>From what Zoe could figure out from the conversation, Tracy never mentioned what happened in her art class, and since Zoe never did either, their friends never knew. Zoe soon allowed herself to be distracted by the delicious lunch and she focused on that so intently that time flew by, and then it was time for the bell to ring.</p><br><br><p>Brooke helped Zoe up, and they separated from family and friends, as Brooke took her to the Auditorium for her part in the play. As they entered, Zoe saw the artwork and recognized what she'd painted, causing her to smile. Their approach brought her to a tower artwork, which it turns out was made out of cardboard, and wood so that it could hold her.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was soon seated, and members of the drama department bound her hands, as well as those of her legs, with rope. Then a large man, or woman, picked her up and carried her into the tower, and gently placed her down on a mattress. Zoe looked around and took note of a screen, which was currently black, seemingly off.</p><br><br><p>The door was open so she could see out, and saw Brooke arrive in a cool costume, with a fake sword, which she wielded as if she was an expert. Zoe smiled as she watched, before the doors to the tower were closed, and the screen activated, showing her an up close view of the scene outside.</p><br><br><p>Brooke held the sword up with a confident smirk. ‶Hear me, fowl ones! I, the hero Blix, am here to save the princess! Let me tell you now if you wish to survive this encounter, aid me in battle and save her, or stay out of my way!‶ She said as the students acting like the antagonist in the play arrived. ‶Hero Blix, you shall never again see the princess, for she is to be sacrificed to bring our master, the demon lord, back!‶ They said. The antagonists brandished their weapons and with them pretended to threaten the hero protagonist.</p><br><br><p>Zoe gasped as she saw Brooke, or rather Hero Blix moved forward, and with a swift sword movement, she disarmed her first opponent. It seemed to be a shock and surprise to them, as much as it was for her. Because the first disarmed antagonist just stared at the sword now on the floor, before he remembered he needed to get into character, which was the moment where Blix stabbed him through the heart.</p><br><br><p>Zoe observed the acting and noted how the first antagonist overacted as he fell to the ground and died from the wounds he received. She recalled from the movies and shows she'd seen how the scenes were played there. From what she'd seen, the villains Brooke was fighting were overacting, and unfortunately she wasn't sure this was realistic.</p><br><br><p>But she wondered, since her exposure had been TV shows, or movies, whether what she was seeing now was how death was really like.</p><br><br><p>The 9th grader smiled as she watched Brooke, or rather Hero Blix, defeat the bad guys one after another. When she disarmed another opponent and took his sword, Zoe began thinking that maybe had they stayed out during their date, that they or she would be safe on the off chance some bad person came up to them. Zoe was amazed at the skills Brooke was displaying, and clearly, the audience was as well.</p><br><br><p>Brooke ducked to avoid a strike, weaving through the crowd as if she was a ballerina. Blocking or dodging their attacks, deflecting sword hits, and disarming her opponents. Eventually, the 5 antagonists were down, defeated. With a swish, Brooke sheathed her blade and pressed onward, her eyes peeled for any danger or signs of Zoe's presence.</p><br><br><p>Of course Brooke knew that the tower Zoe was lying in was at the side, and covered with a curtain. This allowed for some realism to the play.</p><br><br><p>The lights dimmed, and the curtain closed over the stage, signalling a change to the scene. The screen showed the five people Brooke took down, getting up from the floor and shifted her view to the backstage manager. As the setting was moved into place again, the backstage manager appeared ready to open the curtain... </p><br><br><p>Zoe tried the rope bound around her. The ones who tied her had made it so her arms were behind her, like in movies or shows, though Zoe would prefer that they be in front of her rather than behind her. It was a little uncomfortable, but not as uncomfortable as the bounds on her legs. Fortunately, the bounds around her legs weren't too tight that they cut off circulation. But the one that bound her lower area with rope also added a loop around her privates, and when she jerked for whatever reason, it rubbed just right on her spot.</p><br><br><p>Unfortunately, because of the way the volume setting was, whenever the sword clanged, it caused her to jerk as it was loud and, at times, unexpected. Thus, by the time the next scene happened, she was soaked down there and dripping. She tried not to scream out at the effect it was having on her. She didn't want the audience to know something unexpected was happening.</p><br><br><p>Having felt the tower shake when she wiggled caused her to become afraid, and she tried not to wiggle so that the tower fell. Since she was inside, she knew she'd get hurt, but so wound the others in the play.</p><br><br><p>In the second part of the play, Brooke had made it into the castle and was now in the first room of the castle. There they met her with more soldiers in the employ of the dark side. Once more, she repeated her statements. ‶I, the hero Blix, am here to save the princess!‶ But unlike before, they interrupted her before she could say her next lines. Zoe felt bad for the character, but she knew heroes always win. She also knew that with Brooke's skills, with the sword, she'd easily win.</p><br><br><p>Like the ballerina, Brooke nimbly moved through the group of bad guys, fighting and slashing, causing the defeat of the bad guys. But as she watched, she noticed the volume on the screen seemed to be faulty, as sometimes it was loud, other times it was quiet. She didn't know what was going on, though. She tried not to focus on the sound, tried to tune it out. Since Brooke seemed to repeat her lines, she thought it would be fine, but she wasn't sure it was respectful.</p><br><br><p>Brooke/Hero Blix stepped forward towards the group of enemies ahead of her. Zoe recognized them as the same ones Brooke fought before, but there was a subtle difference and the masks they wore were different, too. Still the same swords though, and they still clanked against each other, causing her distraction, and didn't allow her to hear the lines they were saying.</p><br><br><p>Having had enough of the rope too close to her privates, she tried to reach with her hands to try to take care of the issue, but that didn't work out so well due to it pulling on the rope which rubbed against her crotch.</p><br><br><p>The lights dimming signaled a change, but this time she tried to call out to the outside to try to get some help. But she couldn't call out because they had covered her mouth. Then she felt the wobbling as someone came up the stairs to the tower. Lights shone in, illuminating Brooke's smiling face. Zoe was so pleased to see her, but the things she'd gone through had caused her tears to come out. This caused the smile to disappear.</p><br><br><p>Brooke looked over her to see what might be hurting her, and that's when she saw the rope over her crotch. So she signaled one of the backstage people to come up.</p><br><br><p>‶I think that's causing her problems. Why is it like that?‶ Brooke asked with an angry tone of voice. ‶Not sure. I mean, we didn't plan on tying it over her crotch. Come to think of it, Ben isn't here ... Odd, but I'll see what I can do. The backstage guy worked to loosen the rope and moved it away from Zoe's crotch as Brooke grabbed a Kleenex and gently whipped her privates and also with another Kleenex, she dried her tears. The gag was removed and Zoe was given a drink of water.</p><br><br><p>As Zoe drank, Brooke asked, ‶So what's Ben's last name?‶ Fortunately, Zoe had finished drinking by the time he gave the answer. ‶Sunder,‶ he replied before he checked to make sure the rope won't return. ‶Sunder?! Damn it all, I really hate that family!‶ Brooke groaned in anger. ‶Yeah, his brother got expelled for his shit too,‶ the boy replied, then turned. ‶I think I got it to where the rope won't slip anymore. But if it does, just tap your foot there three times‶ He pointed to where she should tap.</p><br><br><p>Remembering the volume issues, Zoe spoke before they left, ‶Wait ... Before you go, could you check the sound thing on that?‶ She nodded to the screen before explaining. ‶it's been getting quiet and then suddenly loud ... Caused me to jerk...‶</p><br><br><p>Brooke frowned and kissed Zoe on her cheek ‶I'm sorry they hadn't realized that‶ she told her, then glanced at the boy beside her. Who immediately went to check the screen. Apparently, the screen had a remote control for it, which also controlled the volume. Turns out Ben Sunder had been playing with it, as he watched. Fortunately, the remote was retrieved when he ran away.</p><br><br><p>Now Natalie, who Zoe had met, had control over the remote. Natalie also decided to keep Zoe company up in the tower, as she wouldn't be needed until the last scene. She got Zoe to a new position with Zoe's head resting on Natalie's lap. Zoe felt warm hands rubbing her arm as she prepared herself to watch.</p><br><br><p>Zoe watched Brooke as she began acting again, and as she did, she felt Natalie's hand resting on her shoulder. She gently rubbed as she, too, watched the performance. With Natalie now in control over the remote, she no longer jumped when the swords made contact. It wasn't loud at all. As Brooke as her character began fighting more bad guys, Zoe whispered, ‶Knowing how skilled she is with her sword, I feel so safe.‶ She told Natalie, who smiled as seen in the reflection on the screen. ‶Yeah, we took fencing together, growing up, so knew she'd be perfect for the part. But shh! Let's watch‶ she said not knowing if their voices could be heard by those on the stage or the Audience. She didn't want to cause a distraction, and neither did Zoe honestly.</p><br><br><p>Brooke dispatched a few more soldiers and made her way forward to where the antagonist's leader was. ‶Evil lord Velky Zadek! As you have seen, I have dispatched your army, your plan to sacrifice the lady Rose, princess of the kingdom, shall not succeed this day! Your Master shall forever suffer in the pit of torment where all evil goes when they die!‶ Brooke said confidently as she glared at her opponent. Zoe could almost sense an edge in her voice like she wasn't simply acting, but channeling anger in order to show emotion to what she was saying.</p><br><br><p>Zoe began thinking that Brooke was still angry about what happened. This caused her to worry that she was hurt more than she was, so to be on the safe side, she moved her thighs carefully, and when she found no pain coming from her crotch, she was certain she hadn't been hurt. But she knew only time will tell to show whether she was really hurt.</p><br><br><p>The teen chose to focus her mind on a different future topic, that of the fact that when she leaves the school, she will leave it dressed more than she had been. Zoe was aware, that those clothes were made by students, not purchased for her.</p><br><br><p>The evil lord growled as he arose from his throne. ‶No Hero Blix, the Master will be resurrected, and it will be the Princess Lady Rose whose blood and soul will fuel it! You may have defeated my army, but you will not defeat me, or stop the ritual. This I swear! To you, you annoying clown!‶ As he brandished his sword, Zoe heard the audience cheer for the Hero, and some of the more delinquent students cheered for the antagonists.</p><br><br><p>Zoe watched as Hero and the Dark Lord circled each other, ready to strike with their swords. A smile played on her lips as she watched her crush doing battle bravely. She gasped when the Dark Lord suddenly tried to stab at the Hero, but Brooke blocked it and expertly shoved his sword out of his hand. This forced the Dark Lord back, and Zoe could almost see the startled fear look on his face as she pointed her sword at him and stepped forward. This forced him to walk back until he fell onto his throne. ‶Dark Lord, I vanquish thee!‶ With that, she stabbed the Dark Lord, who overly dramatically dies.</p><br><br><p>The Curtain closed once again, and she felt the tower start to move. This caused Zoe to gasp, but Natalie spoke ‶shh ... Don't worry, they are just getting things ready for the final scene.‶ With another tender hug, before she scurried out of the tower since she wasn't needed. The lights and curtain came back again, and on the screen showed a different view, this time of Brooke and the audience. She saw her sister, and she could make out Cecilia and she saw her parents and other parents in the audience, too.</p><br><br><p>Brooke swung her sword, which broke something that caused the doors to open, and she stepped in. ‶Princess! You are safe now, my lady!‶ Brooke said and carefully undid the bounds on her arms and legs. Her final act was to pull the rope off of the naked princess before picking her up. Brooke carried her out of the tower and down the stairs. While distracted by Brooke's heroic carrying, she remembered she had lines to say, like Brooke had.</p><br><br><p>‶Noble Hero Blix, you have saved me! I shall be forever grateful for your courage and skill! As the Princess, I will fulfill any desire you have. Please let me know what it is!‶ Zoe said as she held onto Brooke. It surprised her that the audience didn't comment on her nudity. She supposed with how long the program had been active, that they were used to it.</p><br><br><p>‶Yes, Princess, there is something I desire. I wish to marry thee, for I love your beautiful face with all my heart!‶ The Hero Blix said, as she held Lady Rose close. ‶Oh, Hero Blix! Yes, I shall marry thee, for indeed, as a Damsel in distress, you are my hero and I truly do desire to spend time with you! Let us depart these lands and return home to the safety of our kingdom. Tell the queen of my rescue that she might aid us in making our marriage official!‶ She said, and the two kissed as the curtains closed.</p><br><br><p>Once it was opened again, Brooke and Zoe stood there facing the audience as their fellow cast mates joined them, and they all bowed to the audience. Natalie also gave thanks to the prop departments, and also Zoe's third period class for helping with the decorations, and not only that, but a special thanks to their Hero and Princess who volunteered to be a part of the play.</p><br><br><p>As Natalie spoke, the audience applauded, which grew louder at the special thanks. Once the Curtain closed, Brooke and Zoe said their goodbyes to the other drama club members before Brooke led her to her crush's third period class. Before her hanging was the most beautiful blue dress, she'd ever seen.</p><br><br><p>Brooke gently guided her to a seat where she saw a pair of underwear waiting for her. These also looked well made, and like the dress, it seemed as if it didn't look like something students could make. It made her think that she was underestimating students' skills. Brooke slid her new panties up her legs, and once Zoe stood up, she slid them all the way up, before the bra was put on. Both fit her perfectly same as the dress she now wore.</p><br><br><p>She remembered that Brooke's classmates had copied her notes, which meant that Brooke did the measuring perfectly. She smiled as she looked at herself in the mirror and then walked out to show Brooke. The reaction she'd gotten from Brooke caused her to smile wider, and now that there was more room, she swished the skirt part of the dress.</p><br><br><p>‶Alright, let's go find our friends and parents. ‶ Zoe said as she desired to return to her family and their friends. As part of Brooke's response, Brooke nodded her head before she spoke. ‶I'd love to see their reaction to you in the dress! But does it feel like it fits you? Nothing's loose?‶ Zoe nodded her head with the same smile that remained. ‶Yeah, it fits! And I love the color too!‶ She said, and she saw Brooke grin in pleasure. Brooke went in to change into her normal clothes and left the costume on the table.</p><br><br><p>The two walked out of the Home EC classroom into a quiet, empty hall, but they weren't worried. They knew exactly where to go and made their way to the concourse area of the school where they spotted their parents and their friends. As they approached, the former actresses heard Brooke's parents talking to Zoe's parents.</p><br><br><p>Brooke's smile widened as she called out to them ‶Hey everyone! I have something to show you!‶ Brooke said with a smile and stepped aside to show Zoe off. With her new hairstyle and her outfit, she looked cute.</p><br><br><p>She heard her parents swear, and Tracy gasped. All seemed to like what they saw as they walked closer. Nicole fished out her camera and took pictures of her daughter in the outfit. ‶Oh my sweetie, you look cute in that! And to think a student made it! Brooke, on Monday, could you thank your class for their kindness?‶ She asked, and Brooke nodded in reply. ‶I sure will!‶ She said before going into a conversation with her parents. Zoe assumed she was asking them what they thought of the play and it turns out they liked it. Turns out there was someone she hadn't seen done sign language so those hearing impaired could understand what was going on.</p><br><br><p>Kelly hugged her daughter and held her side as the group conversed with each other. It was decided that they would be going to a restaurant to celebrate the success of the play. Zoe soon found herself being picked up by one of the girl's fathers who'd heard about her condition, so he wanted to make it easier on her. With that, the large group of students and parents walked out to the various cars. Zoe went in Brooke's car with Tracy while the others went in the other cars.</p><br><br><p>Now in the car, safe, Zoe relaxed in the seat. She listened to Tracy and Brooke talk about the play, and since she hadn't been able to tell her before the next act happened, about the rope incident. Zoe recognized behaviors and sounds that told her that Tracy was angry, possibly at another member of the Sunder family. They thought it was fortunate that she hadn't been seriously hurt.</p><br><br><p>The next sound Zoe heard was clicking sounds, and because her eyes were closed, she opened them to see her sister texting on the app again. ‶I told the Principal about Ben, but he'd already heard about it, but he promised to handle it,‶ Tracy said and glanced Zoe with a smile. ‶Sounds good,‶ Brooke said as she focused on driving.</p><br><br><p>Deciding a change in topic was needed, Tracy spoke to Zoe. ‶You know you really do look cute like that, sis!‶ Her words caused Zoe to blush as they soon arrived at their destination.</p><br><br><p>The three joined the others at the table with their food already set for them. Someone in their group called ahead with their orders, and with that, they began eating their food. Zoe was silent like usual as she ate her food, but became distracted as she heard a ping sound from her sister's phone. She saw her reading a text from the app and smiled when their eyes met.</p><br><br><p>Tracy went back to eating her food, and Zoe started thinking about the app and the possibility of getting on it. Her thoughts caused her eating to slow to a stop before Tracy gently nudged her to catch her attention. Tracy also indicated she should eat her food, causing Zoe to blush and nod as she went back to eating her food.</p><br><br><p>Eventually, the group finished their meal, and then the dessert before it was time that they all separated. Zoe had wanted to go home and do her homework, as well as get to bed, as it had been an exciting and active day. She knew that Tracy had a date with her boyfriend, and like Zoe, Brooke wanted to go home and rest. The other girls in the group either had dates or homework to do so. They said their goodbyes and went their separate ways.</p><br><br><p>Tracy soon remembered the question Zoe had asked in her second period class. She knew that before the date, she'd need to set her parents and her sister down to talk. With Nicole and Kelly sitting on the couch with Zoe soon arriving, she spoke.</p><br><br><p>‶Zoe was asking about a stabbing she overheard some kids talk about, namely that if they did their requests that they might get hurt ... So I think it's time we talked about it.‶ Tracy started off, and her words caused her parents to become surprised and worried.</p><br><br><p>Tracy looked at her sister and spoke to her. ‶Zee ... remember when we had to switch schools in elementary school?‶ Tracy asked and Zoe nodded. Kelly sighed before taking over for her eldest daughter.</p><br><br><p>‶That hadn't actually been because of a new job opportunity,‶ Kelly said to Zoe, who now had a shocked look on her face. ‶When you were 6 years old, you were in the bathroom and you were going through your leg spasm. As you know how you are in that state, you're not aware of your surroundings...‶ Kelly said. Tracy interjected here ‶A teacher decided to take advantage of that he had your pants down, and was puling his own down too. I had kinda stolen Mama Kelly's knife for show and tell, but I used it ... I tried to cut his penis, but I missed him. As a result, they tried to expel me, siting violence, but our moms decided to take you out of that school and put you in a new one.‶ Tracy said.</p><br><br><p>Zoe was shocked and in awe as she listened to the tale, especially how she had just learned that she was almost raped when she was really little. Zoe found herself starting to cry as she hugged her sister, before deciding a change of scenery was needed, and returned to her room. She took the moment to process the information she'd been given, and that her sister had risked getting expelled to protect her.</p><br><br><p>She thought of her sister's actions and saw that her sister truly loved and was very protective of her.</p>"
