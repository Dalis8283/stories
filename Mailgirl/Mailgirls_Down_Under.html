                    subtitle: "",
                    content: `As this is an origin story it starts with the negotiations that led to Australian mailgirls evolving differently to those in other countries. So it takes a bit of time before the clothes come off. But be sure, they do.<br><br>To be clear, everyone in this story is over the age of eighteen.<br><br>I have been told that there are mailgirls in an office in a large Australian city, and I have been given certain details as to how the program is running there. As this has been based on a true story, names have been changed to those of famous sportspeople (except when they are not) to protect their privacy and the reputation of the company. I earnestly acknowledge all the mailgirls who have gone before in the stories of Cambridge Caine, Seahawk76, et al, and what they have been through. Without them and their experiences this run through the office would not have been possible.<br><br>We are occasionally accused of being upside down in Australia being south of the equator and all that. And so it was when mailgirls were introduced to one of our companies in Melbourne, the local subsidiary of the Japanese Harada Industries, a company that became internationally famous for its pioneering mailgirls programs in Japan and the US. But in Australia the authorities got involved and required a peculiar set of exclusively Australian conditions on their mailgirl program. This has led to some interesting variations to the experience in the company's other branches, particular to Australia. How would this affect mailgirls in other countries?`

                {
                    title: "Pt. 1",
                    subtitle: "Australian mailgirls turn it upside down, and everybody wins.",
                    content: `Mr Harada had come to Melbourne for a visit, and after a tour of the office and having sat through a briefing from his Australian management he was angry. He made his feelings utterly clear to them. He was appalled at the lack of respect that the workers had shown both to him and to the Australian managers during his floorwalk. He was concerned at the whole attitude of the Australian office. And he was concerned at their financial results too. He put Mitchell Johnson, the head of the Australian office, on notice. He had six months to turn things around and to bring it in line with the Japanese and American operations.<br><br>After Mr Harada left the office for a high level business lunch which he pointed did not invite the Australian boss to attend with him, Mitchell Johnson wryly confided to his number two Shane Crawford that Mr Harada may have overlooked the effect that the head office decision from three months prior to cut the Australian headcount by one-tenth had on his staff. One in ten desks in the office was still ostentatiously empty.<br><br>"That's what I'm talking about," Shane exclaimed.<br><br>"That's what you're always talking about," Mitch cautioned him.<br><br>At that moment, the boss's PA appeared at the doorway and Mitch ushered her in. "What do you think about Mr Harada's suggestion, Betty Cuthbert?" her boss asked her.<br><br>She stood rigid and glared at him. "I'm not going to work naked," she spat back.<br><br>"No one asked you to, and I'll make sure that it's not compulsory," Mitch assured her. "But you know the company's reputation overseas. You must have considered that it would come here one day?"<br><br>"I thought we were different in Australia," she retorted with some vehemence. "Isn't there something you can do about it?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Mr Harada expects us to do it," he conceded. "All I can do is try to make sure that it is done as respectfully as possible."<br><br>"Respectful?" Betty fired back. "There will be naked women running around the office. How can that possibly be respectful?"<br><br>Shane nodded. "She's got a point."<br><br>Mitch gave them both his 'I have this under control' look. "I have some ideas. Some local variations. You will just have to trust me and wait and see." The other two looked unconvinced. "Just trust me," Mitch repeated. "And let's keep this under our hats. How many other people know about this?"<br><br>Betty Cuthbert grimaced. "Uh, everyone."<br><br>"What?!" Mitch demanded.<br><br>Betty shook her head. "Mr Harada spoke to the press. They asked him if they were coming here, and he said yes." Mitch slumped at his desk. In the silence of the realisation both Mitch and Shane noted that Betty being Betty would not even utter the word.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After his return to Japan, Mr Harada was in regular contact with Mitchel Johnson eager to know the progress of the introduction of mailgirls to the Melbourne office. Oblivious to the effects of the downsizing, he was convinced that the problem of respect for management — and for him — in the Australian division could be solved by introducing mailgirls as the bottom rung of the office hierarchy as they were in the US and Japan. He explained to Mitch that their introduction would push the rest of the workforce into happily accepting their own place in the company structure. He was deaf to Mitch Johnson's remonstrations that Australia did not work like that, that they were not very accepting of hierarchies. Mr Harada — or his assistants — sent Mitch videos of how the program ran in Japan and in the US to remind him what was expected.<br><br>He sent them to Shane too. Mitch knew this because Shane would visit his office and talk about the latest video he had seen. Mitch suspected that Mr Harada — or whoever maintained his email account — assumed that Mitch would not watch the videos but that Shane would and the message would get to Mitch that way. Especially when the videos would arrive on Fridays in time for their debrief sessions in the boardroom with the large screen that Shane somehow always projected the latest one on.<br><br>So Mitch got to watch the ever unsmiling, austere Mrs Ogawa discipline the mailgirls in Mr Harada's office, got to see the US mailgirls preparing themselves in the morning. Got to see the mailgirls nonchalantly walking through the offices completely naked, stopping at a desk to collect a message, getting on their knees to assume the position on the floor next to a worker who was busy at their work while the mailgirl patiently waited for their next assignment. Mitch wondered if the videos were made by experienced porn producers judging by the way that the cameras unnecessarily lingered on their tight buttocks, on their smooth crotches and on their impressive breasts for longer than was really needed. Like they were trying to get a rise out of the viewer.<br><br>In Friday's clip, Mrs Ogawa had two attractive, completely naked mailgirls kneeling in the centre of Mr Harada's dark wood panelled office. She held a whip, a black riding crop, as Shane informed Mitch as he narrated the action. Shane translated Mrs Ogawa's recitation that Mailgirl 7 had been more than five minutes late on two occasions during the week. And that Mailgirl 13 had looked a senior executive in the eye. Mr Harada sat impassive in the background, watching the action. Mrs Ogawa advised the number of strokes that each of the mailgirls was due and then with a dangerous smile gave the whip to Mailgirl 7 who gasped as she learned that she was to punish the other mailgirl herself. She swished casually with her first attempt, clearly not experienced in doing such a thing. Mrs Ogawa barked something obvious at her so she leant into the next lash and kept it brutal for the remainder of the sentence.<br><br>Then it was Mailgirl 7's turn to be punished. Mailgirl 13 had barely flinched as the whip bit on her thighs and on her smooth, shiny bottom, and she now took the whip and loomed over the other mailgirl, who trembled knowing what was coming. The camera closed in on Mailgirl 13's face as a single teardrop ran down her cheek. The camera then pulled back to show ten men, no doubt, Mr Harada's senior executives, sitting against the walls, watching the spectacle as impassively as Mr Harada at his desk, as impassively as Mrs Ogawa with her arms crossed, and as impassively as the two young naked women in the centre of the room.<br><br>Shane stopped his narration for a moment. "I can't see that happening here," he commented. Mitch shook his head in agreement.<br><br>The video closed in on Mr Harada's face while in the background the taller mailgirl punished her colleague. Mr Harada looked into the camera as if he was looking straight at Mitch with a look that said 'this will happen in your office.'<br><br>The camera pulled back for the end of the punishment. Mrs Ogawa walked up to the mailgirls so that Mailgirl 13 could return her the whip as they both stood straight and bowed to her. They then strode around the room together to bow to each of the executives before they exited the room. The camera lingered on their marked buttocks for a moment before they had fully departed. At which point the video suddenly ended.<br><br>It should have been no surprise to Mitch that subsequent videos clearly showed the red whip marks on the shiny white buttocks of the apparently unconcerned mailgirls as they strode between desks and up and down stairs. Mitch realised that he was becoming desensitised to the point where naked, whip marked mailgirls could seem like a normal aspect of a busy office. The videos clearly tried to demonstrate that the clothed office workers of both sexes worked hard and diligently while the mailgirls wove between them. Perhaps Mr Harada was right and they did serve as some sort of warning or cautionary lesson to the others.<br><br>Of course, Mitch knew that it did not always work out that way. The US office at least was open about some of the disciplinary issues that they had with their clothed workers, especially the ones who overstepped the don't touch boundaries. And Mitch wondered how tempting such overstepping would be in his case. He has the wary eyes of his wife Jessica on him and he had been faithful to her, well at least faithful enough over their more than twenty years together, so he hoped that naked mailgirls around him would not prove too much of a distraction.<br><br>And in general that was one dilemma that he constantly pondered. How with the ever present temptation of a group of beautiful nude women could an office actually improve its productivity. There was no payoff that Mitch could imagine that did not result in time spent away from the workers' tasks at hand. The speed or reliability of delivery of messages did not seem like a likely counter to that. The resistance that his PA Betty Cuthbert had shown did not bode well either. Especially if others felt that way.<br><br>And there was the cost. Shane prepared a budget that estimated employing and outfitting six mailgirls and having someone to manage them was going to cost upwards of a million dollars. Shane nonchalantly stated that that cost was not a problem. Since he had an idea that he would share with Mitch at the right time.<br><br>On Friday, Shane burst into Mitch's office. "Got an American vid for you, boss. Assuming you haven't watched it."<br><br>Mitch smiled. It was there unopened in an email from Mr Harada. And they both knew.<br><br>"Five o'clock in the meeting room," Shane gushed. "And I have a special new vintage Shiraz that you have to try. And you can't say no. I know you'll like it."<br><br>Mitch groaned, there was no getting out of that. But he stared at Shane. "You came down from the tenth to tell me that?"<br><br>Shane laughed. "Sensitive communications. We don't want any others finding out, do we? That's why we need mailgirls."<br><br>Mitch shook his head at the illogic of that. "How's the new office?" he asked. Shane had moved from the sixth floor to the tenth after the decimation to take advantage of a suddenly vacated larger office.<br><br>"Secluded," Shane smiled, like it was the best thing to happen. Maybe it was.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Typically the video started by piling on its production values. A pristine empty office, the dawn light diffusing artfully through the floor to roof windows. And from the side of the shot a heavenly proportioned naked woman flows across as she speeds down the aisle and out of shot. And then the heavenly woman flowed again in the same way only this time the desks are occupied with diligent workers. She wafts through on her mission as the office keeps buzzing, the workers keep working and the sun keeps shining. The camera lingers on the mailgirl to show that she is statuesque and fit, with a hard body, firm breasts, taut buttocks and a flowing mane of wavy blonde hair.<br><br>The next setup shows the mailgirls showering. We first watch them somewhat obscured by the steam from the showers because we are watching them from the foyer while they are frolicking on the mezzanine. The film seems to be slowed down to linger on the exquisite, nude bodies as the water cascades from the shower heads.<br><br>"It's a shampoo commercial, but you get to see everything," Shane gushed. Mitch nodded because he was right.<br><br>A confident male voiceover drones about American values and the best conditions in the world to the point where it became background noise. Office workers enter the foyer from the street, glance up at the showering mailgirls with smiles of recognition on their business-like way to the lifts. A middle aged male concierge in a showy uniform grins like he has won the lottery because he gets to spend all the time greeting workers and hoping that they have a nice day as well as keeping his eyes on the mailgirls in the change room on the level above. He keeps glancing up. They are now out of the showers and attending to themselves and preparing their bodies to meet their required standards.<br><br>And the camera is amongst them. There is laughter and razors and open crotches as they make sure that they are hair free below the neck and perfectly groomed for their role in the office.<br><br>And Shane says what Mitch is also thinking. "They all look the same."<br><br>Which was true. The American mailgirls are all wide straight toothed smiles, pert noses, bright eyes, long flowing hair tied in ponlytails, lithe bodies, long legs and firm breasts and buttocks.<br><br>"Like they're all off Baywatch," Shane adds and Mitch nods because he is right. Are these actors, Mitch wonders or has Harada Industries in the US deliberately recruited some sort of naked realisation of the American dream?<br><br>At a signal that was not apparent to Shane and Mitch watching, the mailgirls stood to attention in a row as a smiling, elegantly dressed woman strode down the line they had made intimately inspecting them. Her fingers probe under their armpits, across their mounds and around their slits. Each one of them. She gave them each an approving smile. Satisfied with what she has seen and felt, she delivers a short pep talk about how they had to maintain standards for the good of the company and the morale of the workers or some such guff.<br><br>The girls all flashed their enchanting smiles when she was done and then broke ranks to affix their pagers to their arms and then paired off to adorn their bodies with their mailgirl numbers.<br><br>After that, they peeled away one by one as their pagers gave them their instructions and destinations. Eventually only one mailgirl is left, sitting on the bench in the change room, carefree and happy, in her natural state. The camera closes up on her perfect face and she beams a 1000 Watt smile as if she could not be happier. Apparently her pager has now beeped because without shifting a muscle on her face, she stands up and heads for the exit. As we watch her march out from behind, it is clear that she was the mailgirl in the initial dreamy start.<br><br>Shane raised his glass of red as the screen went blank. It was a sort of a toast but he was waiting to see how Mitch would react. Mitch thought for a while. "Rather clean and wholesome, wasn't it?" Mitch smiled.<br><br>"The wife will find it funny," sniggered Shane.<br><br>"You show her?" Mitch exclaimed, wondering what reception he would get from Jessica.<br><br>Shane was relaxed about it. "She finds them all hilarious," he smiled.<br><br>Mitch smiled back, wondering why. "Interesting that they were wearing the big phone things rather than the smart watches."<br><br>Shane got serious for a moment. "You really need to read those emails. That's part of our specs too. Apparently Mr Harada prefers the phones, so the watches have been scrapped."<br><br>Mitch got serious too, realising. "I'll bet that's because they're more visible. They make it more obvious that the mailgirls are slaves to the technology and what they are there for."<br><br>"The hierarchical thing?"<br><br>"I'd say so." Mitch took a liberal sip of his wine and nodded his approval. "Nice drop." Then he shook his head. "I still cannot quite see how it is going to work in here."<br><br>But both knew that the time was coming. And it was coming soon, and they had to become ready.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"Do your underlings call you Mr Johnson?" Mr Harada would ask, and the reply would be "No, everyone calls me Mitch." Because that is how an Australian office works. And the Australian boss did not want to even consider what his staff might call him behind his back. You just have to live with it.<br><br>Shane had raised the cost of the program with Mr Harada who promised that head office would bear the cost for the first year or, as he said, until the program started to pay for itself. Yeah sure, Mitch thought when Shane told him, like that is going to happen.<br><br>Mitch also had other mailgirl related pressures. So far he had manage to avoid contact with the Victorian government which had tried to contact him and others in the company a number of times to find out what they were doing. And there were constant attempts by the press to find out what was going on inside the company too. Which Mitch was sure was related to the increased number of people 'just taking photos' outside the front of the office in Swanston Street. And the occasional TV News camera set up to see if they could get something from the staff as they came or went. So far no one had said anything to the press that gave them anything to blow up into a controversy. A few protesters made some noise out in the street but the combination of Melbourne winter weather and the lack of any news on the progress of the program meant that they quickly ran out of steam and vanished, leaving the place running as normal most of the time.<br><br>Mitch was doubly upset by the attempts to make the issue public. He was a naturally private man and until Mr Harada's press announcement, Harada Industries in Australia had mostly flown under the radar which was a major reason why Mitch enjoyed his job. The company was a private subsidiary of the Japanese company, it was not listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and despite the worldwide notoriety of Harada Industries due to its mailgirls, Mitch expected that most people did not even know about the subsidiary's presence in Australia unless they found themselves doing business with the Australian arm or applying to work there. That had now all changed and he felt the pressure.<br><br>Mitch worked through the logistics of the mailgirls program. The company occupied six levels of a twenty-six storey building, floors five to ten, and due to a quirk in the lease had sole use of the gymnasium on the mezzanine which was officially level two. An IT company that Mitch knew little about occupied levels three and four which could be a problem for him if he chose — as the other countries had — to turn the gym, which was notoriously underused by the company's staff, into the mailgirls' base. There would be two flights of stairs for the naked women past their unknown neighbour between the showers and lockers and the company proper.<br><br>And then there were the employment contracts to consider. Mr Harada refused to believe that any of the issues that Mitch raised were any impediment to mailgirls in Australia. His message to Mitch was invariably that Mitch had to sort out any problems and get the mailgirls in the Melbourne office as soon as possible. And he kept reminding Mitch that his subsidiary was performing poorly in relation to the places which already had naked women delivering the mail between floors.<br><br>But Mitch and his team had to grapple with the realities of the project to introduce mailgirls into their work lives. Mitch also felt pressure from his wife who was not beyond suggesting that she was less than impressed with the whole concept. He wondered what his daughters thought about it. And his social friends, both male and female, who were all suggesting that he should invite them to the office once the program was up and running. To all of them, he replied 'it won't be like that.'<br><br>But 'like that' was what everyone had seen in videos and photographs and interviews on the net. And it seemed that everyone Mitch knew had seen the videos. The American mailgirls' morning change room routine was on public display to anyone who was in the foyer at the time. The photos and videos of mailgirls assuming their resting position on their knees with their straight backs and spread legs showing everything off seemed to be everywhere.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>And Mitch was copping it at home.<br><br>"Are you going to be staring at naked women all day at work?" Jessica demanded.<br><br>Mitch smiled at her, recalling some of their early days hi-jinks and wondering whether mentioning those would be a good or bad idea. But he couldn't control a boyish smile at his wife.<br><br>That did not seem to help her mood, as she seemed to read his thoughts. "Don't think you are going to get me onside with this by recounting what you and I used to get up to. This is totally different."<br><br>Mitch gave her his big boyish look. "There's nothing I can do about it, Jessica," he mock complained. "We've been forced to by head office."<br><br>"And if head office told you to make components for nuclear war?" his wife taunted.<br><br>Mitch gave her that look. "Oh," she said.<br><br>"It's that or get another job," he reminded her, gesturing vaguely at the palatial home they occupied.<br><br>Looking for a safe retreat, his wife conceded. "I just don't want the girls getting in this discussion." Mitch nodded. As if.<br><br>"Will they be home for dinner?" Mitch asked her.<br><br>Jessica shrugged. "You know as much as I do."<br><br>Cara got back from Uni just as Jessica was dishing up.<br><br>"Where's Emily?" Jessica asked her daughter. Maybe because they were twins, they had chosen different courses and kept separate hours. So Cara's response was unsurprising.<br><br>"Dunno."<br><br>The meal was on the table and they were digging in when Cara looked to her father and made sure that they had eye contact. "How's the mailgirls thing going?" she asked.<br><br>"Your mother doesn't want me to discuss it with you," Mitch replied.<br><br>"Well," Cara came back, "everyone else is discussing it, so I thought I'd get the right story from the person responsible."<br><br>Mitch laughed. "I don't want to know what you know," he tried.<br><br>What sort of girl would do that?" Cara wondered.<br><br>"I don't really know," Mitch admitted. Because he hadn't thought about it since they were nowhere near recruiting yet.<br><br>"They would have to be athletic, good looking and shameless," Cara continued.<br><br>"Do we really have to have this conversation?" Jessica asked her daughter.<br><br>"Why not?" Cara responded. "It looks like dad could do with some assistance." She turned to her mother for the eye contact with her. "Are you okay with it?" Cara demanded of her.<br><br>"I don't think that's a fair question, Cara," her mother responded.<br><br>But Cara did not seem to notice her mother's tone. "Women naked on their knees in the middle of offices. It's available on videos, it's all over the internet. Everyone knows what a mailgirl is. Running around the offices trying to meet impossible deadlines so they don't get punished. And ex-mailgirls alleging that they were virtually slaves to their companies, that they had to just about make jailbreaks to get away and get their lives back to normal. And now, thanks to Dad it's coming to Australia."<br><br>She looked back to her father. "I'm going to ask you the question that mum wants to but I'll bet she hasn't asked. Would you let your daughters do it?"<br><br>Jessica interrupted her daughter. "You're smart and you're getting an education."<br><br>That did not put off Cara. "Mum, they've got girls with MBAs running around naked in the US office. They boast about it on their website."<br><br>Jessica looked over to Mitchell. "Is that true?" she queried.<br><br>Mitch tried to parry. "It's going to be different here.<br><br>"Dad," Cara complained.<br><br>Again Jessica intervened. "Cara, trust your father. Give him a chance on this, okay? Let's keep it all at the office for a while and keep it out of our home, all right?" Jessica held her stare.<br><br>Cara noted her mother's view and nodded, although clearly she still held some reservations.<br><br>But her mother had not quite finished. "And before you get ideas, I don't completely support the idea either. But..." She looked sternly at her husband who gave her a weak smile back. "All right?" Jessica pressed her daughter.<br><br>Cara shrugged. "All right."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Later on, Cara heard her sister come home and go into her room, she thought she ought to catch up with her. She went into her sister's room without knocking, as usual, and found Emily spread out on her back on her bed feigning exhaustion.<br><br>"Where have you been?" Cara asked her, with mocking concern.<br><br>"Celebrating. We scored one against the patriarchy," her sister stated like she had been at the barricades and lucky to get out of a sticky situation intact. Cara considered her sister's state again. Then she noticed that Emily had her phone strapped to her arm.<br><br>Cara came up close and pointed. "Em, why did you do that?" she asked. "You haven't started exercising have you?"<br><br>Emily sighed. "I was part of a protest against the misogynist creeps who are introducing mailgirls to Australia."<br><br>Cara took her gently by the arm and looked deeply into her sister's eyes. "You do realise that dad is the boss of that company?"<br><br>Emily looked genuinely surprised. "What, really?" she asked.<br><br>Cara shook her head. "FMD," she declared.<br><br>Emily missed that. "You should have been at the protest. Do you have any idea what a turn on it is to be naked in public?" she gushed.<br><br>Cara looked aghast at her sister's complete nonchalance. "Double FMD!" Now she was worried. "Were there photos? Was there a video?"<br><br>Emily smiled. "Of course there is. Want to see it?" She took the phone off her arm and did what she needed to cue up the video. She patted the bed next to her, insisting that her sister sit and watch.<br><br>Cara worriedly obeyed and looked over. The video started with Emily already naked and kneeling on a floor. There were others around, that was clear. "I'm glad we're not identical, sis," Cara observed. "But I must say that you scrub up pretty well." Cara concentrated on the images on the phone. "So you are in the middle of the Uni caf. I can only see you in the shot. How many of you are there?"<br><br>Emily smiled. "One."<br><br>Cara laughed. "That's what it looks like. You. Just you naked with your legs spread and surrounded by a couple of dozen of what, supporters? Pervs?"<br><br>"But two other girls joined in later. Look at the next video."<br><br>Cara waited for Emily to start the next one. "Okay, there they are. Nice tits."<br><br>Emily ignored that. "And plenty of others strapped their phones to their arms in solidarity."<br><br>Cara shook her head. "True martyrs to the cause," she noted dryly. She looked hard at her sister. "It would be better if dad and mum don't know about this." Her sister nodded, but clearly only to be agreeable to her twin. Cara could only worry what further demonstrations were planned, whether her sister would make the news and if anyone else would make the connection with her father. She did not dare yet ask her sister any of that. She would have to think if there was a way to stop Emily continuing.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane had made a breakthrough. The IT company on levels three and four was capable of providing and maintaining the comms for the mailgirls' pagers. Mitch had some real fun wrapping the employees of BAD Solutions up in contractual red tape that would silence them and keep them from divulging anything to the outside world about what went on with the mailgirls, under threat of certain destruction and bankruptcy. There was one concession that Mitch made to them however. Floors three and four would be part of the mailgirls program. This was predicated around the need for the IT people there to have access to the hardware and software when their assistance was needed. But it was an easy way to clear the passage up and down the stairs between the gym and the Harada Industries offices. One problem solved.<br><br>The gym was visible from four of the upper storeys above it. Due to a lucky quirk, its windows opened onto the back of the foyer. So the mailgirls would not be visible to people coming into the foyer from the street. You would have to make your way past the security desk and through the lift area to be able to get any view of the mailgirls in what would be their change room. The five floors above the mezzanine could witness the mailgirls getting ready in the mornings, those floors being the two levels of BAD Solutions and the three lower floors of Harada Industries. Shane and Mitch discussed how they were glad that there was little chance of paparazzi style photos of their mailgirls being snapped by unauthorised intruders, and they should not have to worry about the tenants on the higher floors. Visitors to BAD Solutions could be a problem and one that they would deal with. But like all problems that was one that they were sure they could solve. Probably with non-disclosure agreements and more threats to BAD Solutions. So that was solved.<br><br>Eventually Mitch engaged with the government officials. To his surprise the government was mostly concerned with the mailgirls' employment rights and not interested in their lack of clothes. He agreed to a meeting with a pair of government officials who emphasised that any women who agreed to be mailgirls would have fair contracts with proper pay and clear conditions. So the next step was to work out those.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch and Shane were waiting in Mitch's office for the union rep to appear.<br><br>"I bloody hate unions," Shane blustered.<br><br>Mitch stopped him. "I know how you feel. But we have no choice if this thing is going to happen."<br><br>"And what will happen when Mr Harada finds out we have a union in the office. You know what he thinks."<br><br>"Yes, the same as you. But I'll tell him what I told you, we do not have any other choice." And Mitch raised his hand to Shane to warn him that their venting time was over. Because he could see Betty Cuthbert escorting a thin, confident looking young woman to his door. She was dressed professionally, Mitch realised, in a dark jacket, a white blouse and matching dark slacks. Was he expecting her to turn up in a boiler suit or dirty overalls or something? Betty gestured with a smile for her to go in to meet Mitch and Shane who went to the doorway. Introductions were made while they were still standing there.<br><br>"I'm Marjorie Jackson," the visitor announced as she reached out and gave them both a firm handshake. "Everyone calls me Jackson," she added.<br><br>Mitch looked over to Betty but she gave him a sneer and closed the door, returning to her desk outside the meeting. Mitch invited the others to sit down.<br><br>"We didn't want the union involved," Mitch started, "but the Fair Work Commission insisted that we draft an agreement that they could accept, and no law firm would touch it and our own in-house lawyers begged off, saying that they didn't have the expertise. So we had to turn to you. We were advised to contact you by the government."<br><br>Jackson smiled and folded her arms. "Because we cover massage parlour workers?" she challenged.<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "Maybe, I guess. The government people told me that if the lawyers wouldn't do it to call you."<br><br>"And the lawyers wouldn't do it?"<br><br>Mitch smiled at that "We went to left wing firms thinking that they would want to protect vulnerable workers but they said that they have principles. So we went to some right wing lawyers thinking that they would take a libertarian stance and look after anyone's right to do anything that they wanted, but they said that they had principles too. If you ask me, both sides were just scared of what their clients would think of them. So that's why you're here."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "What a great time for lawyers to find their principles."<br><br>"Indeed," Mitch agreed. Shane smiled too. They seemed to have started on the same side.<br><br>Jackson adopted a more serious pose. "Do you think that I don't have principles?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "On the contrary. I assume that you are driven from your experience looking after the interests of marginalised workers to do an honest job here so the workers we are talking about are best protected." Why was no one using the vital eight letter word, he wondered.<br><br>Jackson smiled at that. "Nice words, very flattering. So I help you and you get your government sign off. Yet some quick research tells me that you do not usually let unions anywhere near your workers."<br><br>Shane spoke up. "Because they are not downtrodden."<br><br>Jackson gave him a knowing smile. "Well I guess we'll find out about that." She paused. It was time to begin. "Tell me what are your attitudes to mailgirls?"<br><br>Mitch took that head-on. "I saw one briefly when I was visiting the US office. I think that they are a distraction and I'll be honest, I think this is a personal foible of Mr Harada for his own gratification. Personally, it's not my choice." He let that hang, the implication that he had been saddled with mailgirls, whether he wanted them or not.<br><br>"The controversy and the degradation of women is just a lucky side effect?"<br><br>Mitch nodded. "Something like that. But you know all the counter arguments. The women are well paid, they know what they are getting themselves into and it can be brief time for them that allows them to fast track their way up the hierarchy in a way that is not open to men with similar abilities."<br><br>Jackson picked up his tone. "You don't sound convinced," she noted.<br><br>Mitch smiled out his concerns. "I'm not. My wife and daughters are not completely behind me on this."<br><br>"But here we are."<br><br>Mitch sighed and stated the obvious. "I have been instructed to introduce the program here. Mr Harada has decided we are getting mailgirls, and he is following my progress closely. I have to deliver this. But I want to do it in the best possible way. Which is why you are here."<br><br>"But I am a last resort?"<br><br>"Pretty much so. The people from the government have no template for this. Except to emphasise that we have to look after the rights of all our workers. So there's an opportunity for you."<br><br>Shane burst out. "We're not used to dealing with unions. We thought you would be opposed to it from the start, take a radical feminist view that the whole thing was bad and you'd fight us all the way to ensure that it didn't happen."<br><br>It was Jackson's turn to sigh. "I'll be honest, I didn't support the idea when I was told to come here and see if I could help you to implement this mad idea, but if you are really prepared to be reasonable and deal fairly, I am committed to helping to try to come up with something that can work."<br><br>The temperature of the room fell, as they started to sketch out how the program would work.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch realised that he was sizing up all the young women he saw — in the office, in the street, at bars and restaurants — as potential mailgirls, imagining them naked and kneeling in his office, waiting for him to give them a message or an item to deliver to someone else in the building. He knew that it was not healthy. But what could he do?<br><br>Mitch watched as Jackson strode confidently up to Betty Cuthbert's desk and said hello to her, looking past her to see if he was free yet. "Good morning Marjorie," Betty greeted her with some warmth. Mitch waved her into his office.<br><br>"Good morning Jackson," he chimed in as she entered, heading to her usual seat at the small round table where they worked. "Belinda should be here soon."<br><br>This woman, this thin attractive sassy union rep who was half his age was soon nonchalantly bossing him around in his own office because it was obvious to both of them that she knew much more on the matter at hand, how to draft an acceptable contract for the mailgirls, than he did. Even so, Mitch found himself wondering what Jackson would look like as a mailgirl, naked, thin and pale and slinky, easing her taut narrow buttocks between the desks outside his office on her way to meet her delivery deadlines. He looked at her hoping that she could not read his face or his mind. Shane with Belinda Clark, the head of HR, soon joined them. Mitch had to concentrate harder or he would miss, in his reverie, what Jackson was saying. But there they were, her perky breasts under her blouse and blazer. All he had to do was make her a mailgirl so that he could see her breasts and her buttocks and everything else. So that he could see them. He gave himself a mental slap. This is what he had become.<br><br>Jackson was explaining the tribunal again, as she had developed the concept further. The tribunal was to be three of the mailgirls who would deal with matters they did not like. Which included inappropriate attention from other staff. Belinda Clark was taking notes and seemed to be considering all the details. She had been pressing Jackson on where the tribunal ended and normal HR processes started and there had been quite an email exchange between them. This was Jackson's chance to try to bed down the details. She was riffing on the finer points on where the line would be. Mitch waited for Jackson to finish and for Belinda to finish typing into her Ipad before he spoke up.<br><br>"We need someone who knows how the tribunal should work, how it integrates into the team and who can make sure that it doesn't get carried away with its power."<br><br>Jackson sat up straight and teasingly licked the top of her pen, then rolled it along her lips. Shane looked at Mitch and then looked back at her with his mouth open, showing how Mitch felt although Mitch knew to control his own face.<br><br>"Someone like?" she smiled. "You're talking about their supervisor?"<br><br>This was a role that they were also trying to bed down. Belinda wanted to keep HR at arms distance from the mailgirls and had suggested they employ a fulltime supervisor. Shane had confirmed to Mitch that Mr Harada was in favour of that role and was funding it, probably because he imagined someone in the role like Mrs Ogawa. Given the way that the contracts were looking, the supervisor was more likely to be somewhere between a mentor and social worker with no scope for corporal punishment. Mitch looked at Jackson, sitting there so self assured.<br><br>"Yes," he agreed, "their supervisor."<br><br>Jackson seemed to be reflecting on that.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Cara looked in on Emily in her bedroom. It was one of the things that the twins had always done, walked into each other's bedroom without knocking or warning when they wanted to chat. She found Emily poised on her knees on the floor and naked. And inspecting herself in the mirror, thrusting her hips forward with her knees apart. Her phone was strapped to her arm.<br><br>"What are you doing?" Cara asked, although it was pretty obvious.<br><br>"Practising. You should too," Emily replied without taking her eyes away from the mirror. She rolled her shoulders back to see if that was an improvement.<br><br>"Not my thing," Cara replied, although she did wonder why that was the case. And then she pondered, was everyone going mailgirl crazy like this? She looked closer at her sister. Were there hundreds of women in Melbourne practising like this at that moment? So many articles in the news, so much on social about it. Cara looked again. "Back has to be straighter," she barked. "Legs further apart." She had seen the videos of course and she knew the position. But why had she been so harsh to her sister? And why did her sister instantly obey?<br><br>Cara walked slowly around her poised naked sister, nudged her knees with the toe of her shoe to make her spread wider and poking her back to make her stance just that little straighter, with her breasts forward just that little bit more. Cara felt a sensation that she could not quite describe although she knew it was tied to a sense of control over her sister. It felt good. She looked hard at her sister. "You've got the body to be a mailgirl," she told her. But did she have everything else that it required?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch wondered how he was going to sell a contract with no demerits and no punishments for mailgirls to Mr Harada. Jackson was due for another scoping meeting and he hoped she would give him something to use to make his boss happy.<br><br>Jackson entered Mitch's office with another woman she had brought with her and asked how the rest of the planning was going. Belinda reported that they had a job role drafted for the Mailgirl Supervisor and Mitch caught Jackson's eye, noting her interest in that.<br><br>Jackson then introduced the colleague who had come with her to the meeting. "I brought in a psychologist in the field, Fanny Durack to help me. She has written a report that I hope you have all had the time to read." The looks on the faces of Mitch, Shane and Belinda suggested that Fanny should just get on with her presentation with the assumption that she was starting from zero.<br><br>Fanny knew how to introduce the subject. "Well, it looks like half the psychs in the US are doing their Masters on mailgirls, so I thought I better get in on the ground floor in this country. Due to our labour laws, mailgirls in Australia are going to be a special case."<br><br>This they already knew, she realised as she leafed through her copy of her report titled 'A satisfied mailgirl is a happy mailgirl.' She read out the executive summary stressing the main points.<br><br>Shane interrupted her. "What does that ever mean?" he asked.<br><br>"Sorry, what?" she asked.<br><br>"The title," he explained.<br><br>"Ah," Fanny realised. "Interviews with American mailgirls have found them in a state of sexual tension brought on by their state of undress in an office situation, no surprise, and by the time pressures placed on them to deliver, the poses they are required to hold and the ban on touching themselves or otherwise getting off except when they are showering or on breaks." Fanny looked around to confirm as she expected that she now had everyone's attention. "Interviews have revealed that this is their most disliked part of the job."<br><br>Realising that this was a potential HR problem, Belinda spoke first. "So what are you suggesting?"<br><br>Fanny smiled. "If you want a happy group of exhibitionist naked workers in your office, you have to give them opportunities for relief."<br><br>"That's going to be skating close to the edge of what we are allowed to do in the office?" Mitch asked Jackson.<br><br>Jackson smiled her assurance at him. "That's why I brought Fanny in. She and I have been working on a number of options to, um, keep the mailgirls satisfied while staying within what the Fair Work Commission seems to be allowing us."<br><br>"Such as?" asked Mitch, wondering how much he would dread the answer. He dwelt for a quick moment on Jackson's use of 'us' before giving full attention to Fanny.<br><br>Fanny flicked through her report to the page she wanted. "It comes under the general heading of respect shown to the mailgirls by the workforce. And the setting of boundaries..."<br><br>"Meaning," Jackson concluded for her, "that there will be no touching of mailgirls except with their explicit consent. And..."<br><br>Fanny jumped back in. "There needs to be ample opportunities for the mailgirls to get relief throughout the office. It's a win / win situation. The mailgirls are happy and able to enjoy their job. And if the designated places for them to do it are public enough, then the workforce gets incentivised by viewing the, um, performances in a safe, positive manner."<br><br>"This is all too weird," Mitch complained.<br><br>"But you're always complaining that the mailgirls program needs to be respectful," Shane argued. "And this is respectful."<br><br>"Is it?" Mitch fired back. He looked to Belinda who looked to Jackson.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Sort of," she suggested.<br><br>"See!" Shane insisted. He looked over to Fanny. "What about these public places? What were you thinking of?"<br><br>Fanny looked to Jackson who gestured that the ball was in Fanny's court, so she better play it. "A dildo station on every floor. That way if the mailgirls cannot get off by hand, or just if they happen to choose otherwise, they have a selection of toys to help them."<br><br>Shane's eyes lit up. "A dildo station! Perfect!" he exclaimed then looked around to find that Belinda and Mitch did not seem to share his enthusiasm. He eyeballed Mitch. "Don't you see, Mitch. Tell Mr Harada about these dildo stations and he'll love it. They will overcome his reservations about all the other stuff that you are going to change from what he expected."<br><br>Mitch nodded slowly. Shane might just be right. He could push how the mailgirls were going to masturbate in front of the rest of the staff as something that would contribute to the morale of the office, which was the apparent point of the program and could downplay the stuff that he knew Mr Harada would not like. He leaned back in his chair and nodded slightly more enthusiastically. "We will have dildo stations," he agreed not quite believing what he was saying.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mr Harada did not immediately love the dildo stations. He preferred his mailgirls in state of sexual tension. It makes their punishment sessions more interesting for him.<br><br>So Mitch had to break the news about that to him. "We are not allowed to punish the mailgirls."<br><br>"How can they stop us?" Mr Harada demanded.<br><br>"They can fine the company for duty of care to its workers, they can charge any employees who do the punishment with assault, and they can charge management with negligence. And I have a legal opinion that they could also charge you as the ultimate owner of the company with a whole lot of stuff when you come to visit. They would probably take your passport and keep you in the country for a while." Mitch waited for another tirade.<br><br>For some time Mr Harada said nothing. Then he spoke slowly. "What are suggesting instead?"<br><br>Mitch took to that task with apparent enthusiasm as he repeated the idea. "The dildo stations. The mailgirls are happy, the staff are happy and everybody is productive. Do you want me to go on?"<br><br>"No, you win. You get your dildo stations," Mr Harada relented with some level of exhaustion for the issue. Then he perked up. "If these stations work in your office, we may consider them for the other offices," he added in a way that suggested the idea would be his if it worked.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After the usual working party of four had gone through the draft of the employment agreement, Mitch engineered a moment alone with Jackson. He contrived to take the lift down to the foyer with her after the meeting, still buzzing from the meeting and agreeing that they had a workable agreement that he could hope for approval by the Fair Work Commission. But when they were alone in the foyer, he revealed what he had on his mind.<br><br>"You must be interested in how this thing is going to work, what with the time and effort that you have put into it. We were thinking of offering you a role here."<br><br>Jackson looked at him with interest. "I don't know, supervisor would be a bit mundane," she answered straight away.<br><br>Mitch put on his best negotiator's face. "I wasn't thinking of supervisor. You're right, that role will be a bit mundane."<br><br>Jackson stared at Mitch for the longest moment, clearly waiting for him to come out with what he was thinking. Realising it was up to him, Mitch blurted "would you think of becoming a mailgirl yourself?" Jackson looked at him with shock, but he had started, so he continued. "You know how much it pays and I am pretty sure that the pay is probably higher than what you are getting."<br><br>Jackson looked him in the eyes for another long, silent moment to ensure that he was being serious. She tried to deflate the situation. "Haha, if I was going to consider becoming one of your mailgirls, I would be doing so for the other benefits, not so much the money."<br><br>Mitch narrowed his pitch down to what he thought was really at issue, so far as he was concerned. "We need someone with your skills to make sure that it starts smoothly. You know how to run the tribunal and make sure that it didn't get out of hand. I don't know of anyone else who could do that. Would you consider it for a week or perhaps a little longer until we had things running smoothly? It would be purely transactional."<br><br>Jackson smiled dangerously. "And you get to see my tits."<br><br>Mitch thought he would play along. "And your arse." Jackson did not slap his face which he thought was a positive.<br><br>Instead she kept her hard stare. "Why did you think to even ask me?"<br><br>Mitch had that answer ready. "Because while you were drafting the rules you were thinking what conditions you would expect to see if you were going to be a mailgirl. You were thinking yourself into the role of a mailgirl. And I think we gave you everything that you wanted."<br><br>Jackson shot Mitch a friendly smile. "That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard." She paused and saw the need in his stare. "Since you're so insistent let me think about it."<br><br>Mitch continued. "Just imagine, this would be a way to test your post-feminist principles in a practical way. While getting paid for it. You know all the rules. And this is going to be completely different to anything that has been tried in the workplace before. I think it will be interesting and fun."<br><br>Jackson smiled amicably but she was trying to back out into the street and away from the man. "Okay, you've made your case. Let me think about it."<br><br>Mitch kept his smile to himself as Jackson exited from the foyer with her usual confident stride. In his experience thinking about it usually led to...<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The team of four had a working session. Mitch advised that Mr Harada was happy with their progress and that the Fair Work Commission had approved the employment contracts.<br><br>"I suspect," Shane smiled, "that they didn't read it too closely."<br><br>Belinda smiled. "I suspect that they did."<br><br>Mitch looked over at the apparently comfortable union rep who sat relaxed as usual in her jacket and slacks. He smiled at her. "With you on board for three months, we will start with a total of six and see how we go. So that's five we need to recruit. Let's advertise internally first then see how many we will need from outside. We'll run some discrete public ads after a week."<br><br>Jackson stared back at Mitch with the most normal of workplace appropriate looks. "Do you think you can find five recruits inside the company?" she asked.<br><br>"I have absolutely no idea," he replied and looked to the other two who shrugged. "And," he addressed Jackson, "you're good for three months?"<br><br>She smiled and responded with a sly smile. "You never know. I may have to check in after that to see how well the project actually works." Mitch could only wonder what she was thinking and how she had reached that point. Regardless he had a meeting to run.<br><br>"It would be good to see if you can get the tribunal running properly during that time. None of us have any experience with something like that."<br><br>"Haha, neither do I," Jackson reminded them.<br><br>"But at least you can conceptualise how it is supposed to run," Mitch explained.<br><br>Mitch tried not to concentrate on looking too much at Jackson knowing that he would be seeing her nude every day for three months in the near future. And still he wondered, what makes someone agree to be a mailgirl?<br><br>The Contract<br><br>The mailgirl's conditions of employment in the Melbourne office of Harada Industries:<br><br>Mailgirls are fulltime employees and have all the benefits of employment as offered by Harada Industries to any staff.<br><br>Mailgirls will be recruited on a number of factors other than looks. They are however to be naked during normal working hours, between the mezzanine and level ten.<br><br>Additionally, mailgirls can smoke, drink and masturbate as much as they like in the office during working hours so long as they meet their delivery targets.<br><br>Mailgirls are to be called by names that they select. Not by numbers. They are free to choose their own names or any other names they fancy.<br><br>They can discipline other workers if they are disrespectful to them. Video evidence is to be presented to a tribunal of mailgirls who can set serious penalties for bad behaviour. (See Annex 2.)<br><br>Mailgirls can only be touched with their express consent.<br><br>Mailgirls can demand that workers pleasure them in any way that they see fit. This is not compulsory and is only to occur between the mezzanine and level ten of the building during working hours. If a worker says no to pleasuring a mailgirl, the mailgirl is not to ask that worker for pleasure until such a time as the worker informs the mailgirl that they permit it.<br><br>Mailgirls are allowed to keep bush but have to shave armpits and legs at a minimum each morning in their change room on the mezzanine.<br><br>Mailgirls are eligible for up to two days period leave a month.<br><br>Rather than demerits for missing timelines and for other infractions, mailgirls will be awarded bonus points for exceeding timelines and maintaining standards. (See Annex 3.)<br><br>The company's obligations:<br><br>The company will ensure that mailgirls can only be viewed by employees of Harada Industries and BAD Solutions or other people who are required to work on levels three to ten or are otherwise authorised to be there.<br><br>The company will run compulsory mailgirl respect sessions for all workers on floors three to ten and mailgirl induction sessions for any contractors or new staff which they must attend before having access to those floors.<br><br>The company will set up dildo stations on each floor of the office for the mailgirls' relief.<br><br>Only mailgirls are allowed to touch the items at the dildo stations unless they expressly give other workers permission to handle them.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>As soon as the employment contracts were approved, Belinda advertised the roles. She had impressed Mitch that it didn't matter whether the adverts were discrete or public, the result would be the same, and they would get a better range of applicants the wider they advertised. And Mitch knew that the reports of such a level publicity would impress Mr Harada and keep him happy for a while. Belinda hired Wendy Turnbull as the Mailgirl Supervisor, starting straight away to assist her with the recruitment. Wendy Turnbull was a middle-aged beauty consultant who was looking for 'new opportunities' and radiated the right mix of control and empathy that Belinda was after for the role.<br><br>Wendy and Belinda read the applications as they came in, grading them for the shortlist. They hoped to interview only the five best applicants and then work their way down the list if not all of those five worked out. As it turned out, five women already employed by Harada Industries had applied. Belinda did her preliminary checks, decided all five were suitable and agreed with Mitch that she would interview them with him.<br><br>They had received the induction manual from the US office which outlined the intrusive nature of their interviews and the questions that the candidates were required to answer about their sex lives and proclivities. After some discussion, Mitch and Belinda agreed that they would ask the intimate questions about the candidates' sex lives. But they would stress that the candidates did not have to answer them. What they needed to do was be certain from their interview that the candidate would not mind being nude in the office.<br><br>Mitch knew a way to answer that issue. But still he asked Belinda "So what's the best way to find that out?"<br><br>Belinda smiled wryly. "Well, the interviews will be done with them in the nude. That should answer a few questions." As Mitch expected.<br><br>The interviews were conducted off-site and outside of work hours since all the interviewees were staff and Belinda and Mitch agreed it would not be appropriate for the office to know who would become mailgirls until the contracts were signed. And it would be worse if any of the candidates proved to be not suitable. Only Belinda, Mitch and Wendy Turnbull knew the names of the shortlisted candidates.<br><br>Mitch and Belinda ran the interviews one evening after leaving for the neutral venue separately, acting as if they were just going home. The candidates had been warned that they would do their interviews in the nude. Mitch stationed an Admin Assistant, Annette Kellerman, outside the hotel function room that they had booked. She had been briefed about the candidates, how to manage them in and out of the venue, and she had been given a nice payment for the evening. She had that position fortuitously, as she had applied to be a mailgirl, and she would be the final interviewee.<br><br>Kimiko Date, finance department — interviewee number one<br><br>A knock on the door and then a thin woman, slightly shorter than average height meekly entered the room, careful to close the door behind her. She found herself facing Mitch and Belinda who sat behind a desk at the far end of a medium size room, so there was some space between the candidate and them. Noticing a table against a side wall, she stepped over and undressed, removing her jacket and carefully laying it flat, then removing and folding her blouse on top of it, slipping down her skirt and being equally careful before, now only in matching white pants and a bra, she looked over to the two behind their desk. They were watching her impassively, so understanding her prior instructions, she unclipped her bra, stepped out of her pants, placing them tidily on top of the rest of her clothes. Naked, without any sign of serious emotion or hesitation, she trod up towards the table where the two interviewers sat watching her. Ignoring the chair facing them, she assumed the position on her knees in front of the table, straightened her back and looked down at the floor.<br><br>Mitch spoke up. "Kimiko, you don't have to do that," he urged gently.<br><br>The interviewee did not move from her prone position. She adjusted her knees wider and addressed the floor in front of her in a soft voice. "I know that is how a mailgirl is expected to present herself in Japan," she told them quietly.<br><br>Mitch tried to put her at ease. "Ah, you have been watching the videos of the overseas mailgirls. We won't force you to do that here. But you can if you want to. Now why do you want to be a mailgirl?"<br><br>"I have something to prove to my family," she replied with her soft, determined voice.<br><br>Okay then, Mitch thought. He could only try to guess what that might be and he knew that he would be wrong whatever he thought. He looked over to Belinda who raised her eyebrows. So she asked the next question.<br><br>"I read in your application that you interned in Harada Industries' head office in Japan before moving to Australia and getting a job here. Did you see the mailgirls there?"<br><br>Kimiko kept her pose. "Yes, of course. They were a normal part of the office. Culture, I guess. But in case you are going to ask I never dreamed of being a mailgirl then."<br><br>"May I ask why?" Belinda probed gently.<br><br>"I'm three years older now," Kimiko mysteriously replied.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Business Analyst Lauryn Mark — second interviewee<br><br>Early in her interview. Mitch asked the Business Analyst Lauryn Mark "What's your motivation? Why do you want to do this?" After all, she had a pretty good wage with Harada Industries already and a responsible position in the company.<br><br>Like a well trained interviewee, Lauryn made sure to look both Mitch and Belinda in the eyes as she answered, sitting naked in front of them. "To pay off my student debt, maybe save enough to buy a house." She gave them a look that said she was being totally honest. And gesturing at her state of undress, she added "I have nothing to hide," and laughed. Both her interviewers smiled. "And before you ask, my partner is all for it. He says he is ambitious for me."<br><br>"And do you have any doubts?" Belinda asked.<br><br>Lauryn shook her head. "I've been languishing in my job for a couple of years with no apparent career progression. There doesn't seem to be any movement in my section. And I like working for the company. So I thought I'd try this to see if it gives my career a boost. They say that that is one of the perks in the US."<br><br>"Interesting," Belinda smiled, "do you think that running messages in the nude will give your career the boost that you are hoping for?"<br><br>Lauryn shrugged. "I guess we'll see."<br><br>Mitch spoke up. "We don't want to sugar coat this. We want you to know precisely what you are getting yourself into here."<br><br>Belinda gestured at her state, naked in front of the two of them "I wouldn't be here like this if I wasn't reasonably sure what I was getting myself into here."<br><br>Mitch and Belinda nodded their acceptance of that.<br><br>"So when will I know if I have the job?"<br><br>Mitch looked to Belinda who nodded at him, so he nodded at her. Belinda spoke up. "We'll have the contract for you in the next few days."<br><br>Lauryn stood up and approached them, her breasts swinging freely in front of her. "Thanks," she said and shook both their hands. She exuded confidence and seemed totally at ease naked, Mitch noted. Not for the first time did he wonder what was being unleashed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Heather McKay. "I was born like this." A short stocky worker from the stockroom. Interviewee number three<br><br>A short stocky woman entered the interview room and wandered up to the desk. She wore a loose blouse and a skirt belted tight above her hips. Neither item flattered her.<br><br>"I'm here for the interview."<br><br>Belinda looked her over. "Heather McKay?" she asked and the woman nodded. Mitch smiled at her.<br><br>"Oh," she realised, "I take my clothes off now." Belinda Clark nodded at her. Nonchalantly, she loosed her belt, dropped her skirt and lifted her blouse over her head. She carried them over to the table where she removed her bra and panties as well. She turned around and returned to stand by the desk displaying a fit, curvy body that she was clearly proud of.<br><br>"You can sit," Mitch told her. But she shrugged and remained standing where she was, close to the table but fully visible to her interviewers. With her hands by her sides they could see she had trimmed her bush and she clearly looked after her fitness and her skin.<br><br>"I reckon I was born to do this job," Heather announced. The other two looked at her, so she gestured at her undressed state. "I was born like this," she reminded them with a raucous laugh. Mitch and Belinda smiled. "Ashes to ashes, funk to funky," she recited, "that's the bible."<br><br>"I think it's David Bowie," Mitch grinned.<br><br>"Whatever," Heather responded, her face blank.<br><br>Mitch decided he better start with the questions. "What's your motivation?" he asked.<br><br>"My what?"<br><br>"Ah," he realised, "why do you want to be a mailgirl?"<br><br>Heather cracked a bit smile. "They reckon I'm lazy in the stockroom. But they keep giving me the hardest jobs, the heaviest stuff and the longest deliveries. I reckon that they're setting me up to fail."<br><br>Belinda looked concerned. "Why do you think that?" she asked.<br><br>Heather seemed to know herself. "Because I'm the only girl employed there. I think I scare them. So if I can deliver things around the office as well as any of the other girls I reckon that will show them." She had it worked out, it seemed.<br><br>"In the nude," Mitch confirmed, since she had left that part out.<br><br>Heather did not seem fussed. "In the nuddie, that's right."<br><br>Mitch wrote in his notes 'that's fucked up'.<br><br>"And," she added, "the money."<br><br>Belinda asked Heather if she had any questions. "What training do we get?" she asked them.<br><br>Belinda looked to Mitch. "Well, if you're successful you'll be shown how to use the comms device and given the instruction booklet," he told her.<br><br>Heather looked peeved. "And that's it? No training courses?"<br><br>Belinda weighed in. "Well, I'm not sure what there is that we can give you as a training course. If you think of anything, please tell us. After all, don't forget this is a pilot project for the office, so there's no one experienced. You'll be setting the marks and establishing things as you go."<br><br>Heather finally admitted what she had on her mind. "So we're not going to be sent to the US to learn from the program there?"<br><br>Mitch spoke to that. "I think you will find that things here are quite different from how they are in the States. So no, we won't be sending you there."<br><br>Heather looked disappointed.<br><br>"Is that a problem?" Belinda asked.<br><br>Heather suddenly brightened up. "Nah, that's alright. Although I was hoping for a free trip to the States. You know, see all their sights and eat all their burgers. If someone else is going to pay for it."<br><br>"So are you still interested in the job?" Belinda checked.<br><br>Heather laughed. "Of course. Wandering around the office all day in the nuddy for the money you're offering. Someone's mad, and I reckon it's you."<br><br>They all laughed at that.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Interviewee number four — Jan Stephenson, programmer<br><br>Jan Stephenson, a tall thin programmer with prominent breasts and long blonde hair sat stiffy in front of Mitch and Belinda with a steely look of determination on her face. She had stripped off without a smile or any acknowledgement that they were in the room. Then she trod over and set herself in the chair facing them for the interview.<br><br>Mitch wondered whether she had already made up her mind and had decided that this was a formality or whether she was scared and trying to cover it up. Maybe she was just a habitual bad interviewee. Who could ever find out someone else's true motivations?<br><br>Belinda had picked up the vibes too. "Why do you want to do this?" she snapped at Jan. Mitch shot Belinda a warning look, but Belinda gave him a glance that said she had this under control.<br><br>The interviewee seemed to look straight between the two of them. "Because I'm sick of the rest of the programmers ogling me all day," she stated, with little emotion, maybe just a trace of bitterness. Like if that was how her colleagues treated her, she may as well show them everything, particularly if the company was paying her to do it.<br><br>"And do you think this will help?" Mitch asked her gently.<br><br>Jan shrugged. "Well, I'll do this for two years if I'm successful and then I'll go back to my job. Hopefully by then they would have seen enough of me to leave me alone to get some work done."<br><br>Belinda tried to make eye contact with her "Do you really think that will work?" she asked, still trying to break down the barrier.<br><br>At that Jan got off autopilot, realising that they wanted to see at least something of the real her. "I don't know," she admitted. "But if my job is guaranteed after two years of this and then there's the extra money, then why not?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette Kellerman, PA — interviewee number five<br><br>As soon as the fourth interviewee closed the door behind her on the way out, Annette Kellerman stepped inside. She pulled her dress over her head and took it off revealing that she had nothing on underneath, showing off her strong, athletic body.<br><br>She posed with one hand on her hip. "Good enough?" she asked with a smile.<br><br>"Yes," Mitch replied then, a little worried at his enthusiastic response to her naked body, he looked to Belinda who nodded. Then smiled.<br><br>"I thought you might had have enough of the long interviews," Annette Kellerman suggested. "You can see what you're getting. Is there anything you have to ask me or can we just pack this up?"<br><br>"You read our minds," Mitch joked.<br><br>"That's a skill of mine," Annette Kellerman replied with a serious inflection. "So if I've passed the interview, let's all go home."<br><br>Mitch and Belinda nodded, why not. As Jackson's psychologist colleague had suggested it was about self confidence and a lack of shame. What could go wrong?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was relieved after the interviews. All the candidates seemed suitable and all had agreed to the conditions. And the press had not found out about the interviews which suggested that he could hope for a soft launch without too much hoo-ha, which was how he liked it. He was a bit worn out after his long day and the stress of remaining professional in the presence of five naked women, but he was resigned to that being his lot once the show got started properly. He opened the front door to his home to see Emily waiting for him inside. Looking like she meant business, she dragged him to their empty front room with the others presumably somewhere else in the house.<br><br>"Dad," she exploded, "I didn't get an interview, did I? Did you have anything to do with that?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Fortunately not. I didn't even know that you applied. I did not see any of the applications, only the shortlist. And everyone on the shortlist was an internal applicant. So honestly, I didn't even know you had applied. Does your mother know?" Should he tell her that he did not want his daughter to be a mailgirl. Or would that make her mood worse?<br><br>Emily ignored his explanation anyway. "So it was a fix?"<br><br>"No, we made it a public process because we didn't know how many internals we would get. If any at all. And they had an advantage, I'll grant you, because they had already passed our security clearance — which was a condition — and as well, they could better answer the other criteria which gave them a natural advantage."<br><br>"Other criteria, right." Emily looked resigned but unimpressed.<br><br>So it had come to this. Here he was having a perfectly normal conversation with his daughter about why she was not going to spend her weekdays running naked around his office.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "It’s time for mailgirls to hit the floors.",
                    content: `This was the meeting that Mitchell Johnson was dreading. Shane, his second in command in the Australian operations of Harada Industries, laid out the situation to Mitch and Belinda, the Head of HR. "We have the contracts signed, we have gym converted and we have the dildo stations ready to be set up. That will take about an hour or so. We have the IT gear ready to go and those guys have signed all the disclosure agreements that we could think of. So all we need is a start day."<br><br>"Let me think on it," Mitch suggested.<br><br>"Monday," Shane replied.<br><br>"What?" Mitch retorted.<br><br>Shane was calm and straight. "Let's start it Monday." He looked to Belinda who shrugged and nodded. "Think about it. It's clean, everyone is ready. And it gets Mr Harada off our backs. And by the time he gets himself organised to interfere, everything will be running smoothly and it will be too late."<br><br>Belinda spoke up. "I will confirm that Wendy is ready for the launch." Mitch looked quizzically at her. "Wendy," she reminded him, "the mailgirls' supervisor. You know, the one who did the shortlist with me." Mitch remembered and nodded his tired assent.<br><br>"Great," Shane enthused. "I'll get everything organised. Belinda will tell the mailgirls to be prepared, and I'll get Betty Cuthbert to organise the press." Mitch looked at him, horrified. "So they can cover the launch, Mr Harada would want that." Mitch's mouth stayed open. "Joking," burst Shane. There would be no press.<br><br>"But," added Belinda, "it would be good if you could give a short speech, Mitch. Just to remind everyone what is expected."<br><br>Of course, Mitch worried as he nodded carefully. Everyone will be wondering what to expect. Not least of all himself.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jessica greeted Mitch at the door that night with a concerned look. "Our daughter is not going to become a mailgirl," she declared.<br><br>Mitch sighed. "She's spoken to you too. No, she's not. And believe me, I had nothing to do with it. I only got to vet the short-listers."<br><br>Jessica relaxed at that news with a smirk. "You vetted the short-listers. I don't recall you telling me about that. It must have been onerous."<br><br>Mitch smiled back at his wife. "If I lay even a finger on them I get into trouble."<br><br>Jessica was not done with the discussion. "And if you lay an eye on them..."<br><br>"They are..." Mitch stammered, wondering why any discussion of the subject with his sensible, understanding wife was so difficult. Was there something about her attitude to mailgirls that he had missed? How many ways could he assure her? Mitch looked at Jessica, pleading.<br><br>Jessica backed down. "I know, naked women running around are a normal part of your working day." She smirked. She knew, Mitch had explained the rules.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Two men and a woman in overalls with the hi-viz came around the corner into Betty Cuthbert's area. Mitchell Johnson's PA stopped what she was doing on her computer. The man who led the other two in appeared to be in charge as he studied his tablet while the other two hauled in a low table between them, following him as he studied what were evidently his instructions, the office plan, or both.<br><br>"What are you doing?" Betty Cuthbert demanded in her most managerial voice.<br><br>"The plans say to put this here," the man in charge commented while trying not to engage with her.<br><br>"Put what where?" Betty pronounced loudly, clearly ready for a fight.<br><br>The hi-viz woman spoke up like she thought her gender could ease down the tension. "The plans say that we have to put a dildo station here."<br><br>For some reason that did not seem to please Betty Cuthbert. "I'm not having any of those things anywhere near me," she told them adding that there would be great vengeance if they tried to follow the plan.<br><br>The boss tried nonchalance. "And furious anger?" Betty Cuthbert did not flinch. He looked closely at his tablet. "There has to be one on each level, that's what this thing is telling us."<br><br>Betty stood up and approached them with the confidence of someone who regularly wielded power. "Listen to what I am telling you," she ordered. "You see that corner over there? The one that you came from. Please put it behind that corner, right behind the corner," as she added vehemently "Where. I. Can. Not. See. It. Thank you," she added sweetly.<br><br>She returned to her seat, confident that she had sorted that problem out to her satisfaction.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was dreading Monday. To make things worse, he told none of his family during the weekend what was going to happen in the office after those few days off. Instead he was just unusually irritable and refused to explain why. He wondered how the six mailgirls were handling their last few days of normalcy and decided that they were probably relaxed about it and resigned to what would happen. The interviews suggested that they had all worked out in their own ways what they were doing and why. The five that he had interviewed. Although they were not the ones who carried responsibility for the program. They just had to look after themselves. The five.<br><br>Their contracts made it pretty clear that they were going to be well looked after as well as well paid. No wonder Jackson had agreed to be a mailgirl for three months. She had worked out a pretty cushy wicket for the term of her contract. Probably a lot less stressful than her usual job. He wondered how she would handle it. Jackson. Jackson who had not interviewed or taken anything off or in any way shown that she was capable of being a mailgirl. She had simply gone straight into his office, looked him in the eye and told him she would do it. It was too late to do anything about it, Mitch decided. Finally, he slept well on Sunday night.<br><br>And the other thing. Mitch had been trying to prepare his speech for Monday. Every attempt had either been too pompous, contained observations that were probably not wise to make in front of his staff or the mailgirls or was otherwise just boring and pointless, an interesting irony considering what was going happen in the office. And each draft seemed to turn into a litany of warnings. That was not the way to launch the program, he knew that. Was his starting point really that the presence of six naked women all day in the office would turn everybody back to the worst aspects of their adolescence? It seemed so. He knew that haranguing the staff at the start of their adventure was not a good idea.<br><br>So he decided to wing it. He would look around on the day and get inspiration on his feet. He would be positive at all costs. He did toy with the phrase "I hereby declare the mailgirls open" but knew he was not going to say that.<br><br>And then it was nine o'clock on Monday morning and Mitch was standing in front of perhaps half of his staff with a number of others watching on the video link. Mitch knew that the six who soon to be mailgirls were there dressed, amongst their unsuspecting colleagues in the meeting room, clothed in the office for the last time and soon to be revealed. He looked around for Betty Cuthbert, but she had carried out her threat to stay at her desk and look after any incoming calls.<br><br>Mitch rabbited on for a short while about the exciting phase about to happen in their office, first time in Australia, the noble traditions of Harada Industries, then assuming that he had said enough that no one would remember, he introduced Wendy Turnbull, a large but appealing woman who would be the mailgirls' supervisor. Then without any clever comments, as plain as he could make it, he named the mailgirls one by one. As each one was announced, she moved to the front from where she had been standing in the room, stripped off her clothes and handed them to Wendy Turnbull then stood, naked and facing her colleagues. It was clear that the Melbourne mailgirls were in no way uniform in appearance like the Japanese or American ones. The local cohort ranged from the tall, lanky Annette Kellerman to the stocky and curvy Heather McKay.<br><br>Mitch called out Jackson's name last. There was a gasp of surprise. Mitch himself was curious about seeing her naked. Jackson had been standing near Mitch, where you would expect someone who had worked closely with him to be. But when her name was called, she went over to Wendy at the other side of the room to strip and then to the end of the line of naked mailgirls, furtherest from Mitch, so he had no option but to rubberneck to see her, which he wasn't going to do as he professionally made eye contact with the front row of colleagues who despite the distractions in front of them also were trying to appear professional.<br><br>Wendy took over as soon as Jackson had lined up with the others. "Mailgirls will be going down to the mezzanine now for final briefing, an inspection and the final testing of the pagers," she announced.<br><br>Mitch butted in there. "You will be able to summon the mailgirls for deliveries, let's say, from about midday." He looked over at Wendy Turnbull who nodded. "In that case the meeting is over. Enjoy the rest of your day."<br><br>And who knows, he thought, what is going to happen next.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After the excitement of the launch, Mitch sat at his desk, alone in his office trying to process that there were now six naked women on the mezzanine who would be naked throughout the working day somewhere in the building under his watch.<br><br>Shane burst in. "This is great day for the company, Mitch. Drink?"<br><br>"You think so," Mitch asked sullenly.<br><br>Shane was not going to be downbeat. "We did it," he exclaimed, "naked women in the office!" He looked closely at Mitch. "Does Mr Harada know?" he asked with a knowing smile.<br><br>Mitch conceded a reluctant smile to his deputy. "I was just going to tell me."<br><br>For once Mr Harada praised Mitch and told him that he would not regret it. Ever his own publicity machine, Mr Harada made sure that the press knew about the Melbourne mailgirl launch which meant that TV cameras and photographers descended on the office. Mitch's preparations however went well and no one got any footage of anyone without their clothes. A few workers from the office were chased by journalists trying to evade the cameras when they went out of the office at lunchtime. The only one who appeared on the news was a young guy with a ton of attitude who stopped, stared into the closest camera and stated "if there are any naked women in our office, I haven't seen them." That kept the excitement outside the office alive for only a day or so. Later in the week, a news crew would chase that same employee down Swanston Street shouting "have you seen any yet?" and only getting an enigmatic smile in response.<br><br>So that first day's excitement quickly died down outside the offices of Harada Industries. Inside the office it was a bit of a phony war. Mitch checked the app at three in the afternoon to find no one had thought to call out a mailgirl for a delivery yet. He emailed the news to Shane and was not surprised five minutes later to find a call had registered. Not surprisingly the call was logged to Mailgirl 1, the first on the list. Recalling that the Melbourne mailgirls were to be addressed by their names, Mitch wondered which mailgirl was on their way to pick up from Shane. He called the IT people downstairs and explained the issue to them.<br><br>After a refresh of the app with the numbers replaced by their names, Mitch saw that the order was Annette, Heather, Kimiko, Jan, Lauryn, and Jackson. So the lanky triathlete was the first to pick up and deliver solo in the building. Heather was beeped shortly after and so it began.<br><br>The next morning, Mitch arrived in the foyer to wonder why so many of his employees were gathered at the windows on the upper floors that looked down on the entrance area. He was in the lift before he remembered. Mailgirl preparation and presentation. It did cause a dilemma for him. Did he lead the charge and also watch what was happening on the mezzanine. Or did he stand back and discretely let the others perve and just not get involved until he had to. Getting out of the lift Mitch found the matter was resolved for him. The windows on his floor were crowded with employees craning to see what the mailgirls were up to. With no room for him, Mitch went straight to his office. Betty Cuthbert was at her desk engrossed in her computer screen.<br><br>"Good morning, Betty," Mitch called to her.<br><br>"Is it?" she muttered, not looking up. "Don't forget you have a nine o'clock with the audit and risk team." Mitch nodded his acknowledgement wondered how to deal with her. Could she ever accept the mailgirls?<br><br>At quarter to nine, Jan wandered past Betty who pointedly did not look up from her screen and knocked on Mitch's door. "Come in," he called out.<br><br>Jan strode in looking straight ahead, just past Mitch. He appreciated that she had a light sweat from climbing the stairs. She stopped a good way short of his desk.<br><br>"Everything okay?" Mitch asked her.<br><br>"Am I supposed to get down on my knees or something?" she asked.<br><br>"I don't think so," Mitch replied. "Unless you want to."<br><br>"Ah well, I'll stand then," she decided. She slouched where she stood, a naked woman with one leg a little bent in front of the other for balance, one hand on a thigh. "I have a message for you," she recited. "Mr Crawford wants to remind you there's a meeting at nine."<br><br>"Thanks Jan, it's pretty slow at the moment," Mitch observed.<br><br>"Well, we're getting paid," she responded without much enthusiasm.<br><br>"We'll have to learn how to keep you busy," Mitch promised.<br><br>"I hope so," Jan came back. "Otherwise I'm going to have to do repeat stair climbs on my own volition or something else to keep in trim. This was going to be training for me." Mitch shrugged and smiled at her. She stayed where she was.<br><br>"Am I supposed to stay here until I get another call?" Annette asked.<br><br>Mitch looked at her, sussing that she did not like to stay still for long. "You can stay or you can do your thing on the stairs," he urged and looked back down at his screen.<br><br>"Thanks," she smiled and turned around to exit. She stopped near his door and turned with a cough for attention.<br><br>"Yes?" asked Mitch looking up and getting the whole picture of a tall, nude blonde who was shapely and athletic. He could not help but be impressed by her and she noticed.<br><br>"Thanks for the opportunity," Jan said like she meant it. And she skipped out of the room, past a scowling Betty Cuthbert who glanced in at Mitch and wiped his smile right off his face.<br><br>It took to the end of the week before staff on all floors had found reasons to use the mailgirls. Mitch was surprised at the slow take up. As with the other programs, all staff had the right to use the mailgirls to deliver items within the office. But it was a change from not having mailgirls. Belinda kept Mitch informed that after the first day, on most days at least one of the mailgirls was absent for one legitimate reason or another, meaning that the four or five who turned up were kept pretty busy which must have allayed Jan's concerns. Although Belinda informed Mitch that all the absences were legitimate and tracking at the levels expected.<br><br>One thing was missing from Mitch's office experience during the early days. He had not seen Jackson, and it was Thursday. He had no chance to eyeball her at the launch. And he knew that he could watch the mailgirls preparing in the mornings which meant that he would be able to see her. But somehow he had not had the opportunity to do that. He could have used his admin privileges to call her to his office for a delivery. But he felt that was a bit gauche. And he felt the collective weight of the views of his wife, his daughters and the vehement presence of Betty Cuthbert, all looming over him. As if summoning a mailgirl was, for him at least, a moral failing.<br><br>But still the caveman inside Mitch wanted to see the attractive woman who had held intellectual sway over him during the planning stages naked in his presence. And an aspect of that caveman felt jealous of the other staff who had seen her while he had not. He felt somewhat proprietorial for first of all bringing her into the office and then for encouraging her to become part of the mailgirl program and therefore naked somewhere near him.<br><br>Mitch was pondering this as he took the stairs to the lunch room on the eighth floor from his office on level sixth when Jackson bounded down the stairs from a higher floor and almost barged into him.<br><br>"Hi Mitch," she sang out as she brushed past and through the door to the seventh floor. And like that Mitch had seen the naked Jackson and she seemed her usual sassy self, unselfconscious about her appearance, not fussed about being naked around him, and she was gone. And Mitch was left with only the memory of a flash of bare thigh.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lauryn Mark strode towards Mitch's office. As she waltzed past Betty Cuthbert, the beligerent PA made a point of looking the other way. Mitch noticed that Lauryn was her typical self, all swaying breasts, as she approached him with an air of confidence. She swished into Mitch's office and planted herself on a seat facing him, arms on the rests and legs crossed. If she was smoking and clothed she would be Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct.<br><br>"What's wrong with her?" Lauryn demanded of Mitch.<br><br>He smiled. "Ah, Betty Cuthbert is still not comfortable with the mailgirls program. She just needs time."<br><br>Lauryn laughed. "How much time?"<br><br>Mitch smiled. "Another hundred years or so." He paused. "But having someone in the office with that attitude keeps the rest of us grounded. Don't forget, if you can, that this is an unusual environment. If you or I were to go out and go to work for another company it would be unlikely that they would have naked women wandering through the office."<br><br>"Too true. I may have to engage some of my other skills." She straightened her back to emphasise her bust. "But I guess you're not interested in these since you've got Jackson. Now, you wanted to see me to find out how I was getting on."<br><br>Mitch let that slide to concentrate on how Lauryn was handling the role. She assured him that she was fine and had no issues and was enjoying the reactions of the clothed staff. "The fabrics," she confided. Mitch mentioned how confident she had been in the interview and how she seemed to be self-assured whether she had clothes on or not.<br><br>"Well, I guess I can tell you now there was something that I didn't put on my CV," Lauryn smiled. Mitch looked at her enquiringly. "When I was at Uni, I worked as a topless waitress for a time." Mitch looked at her non-judgementally. She smiled broadly. "And sometimes the bottoms came off." Mitch gave her a puzzled look. "All right, I was a stripper."<br><br>"You haven't got cynical about men from it, have you?" Mitch asked her as she recrossed her legs.<br><br>Lauryn shook her head. "Only when they have too much to drink and get a bit ahead of themselves."<br><br>Mitch was quizzical again. That's not a phrase I've heard before."<br><br>Lauryn shrugged. "I think it's self explanatory. Be assured that I know how to look after myself."<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "It was good to talk to you," he concluded. "If we don't have any other reason to catch up beforehand, let's have another chat like this in a few months." Their talk had satisfied Mitch. He felt that maybe he was beginning to understand why these women had taken the path that they had.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Kimiko liked to try to see if she could be invisible. After six weeks, she reasoned that the office was getting used to having naked women wandering the floors or just being present, sitting still or kneeling at their waiting stations. And she suspected that as the quietest mailgirl of all she would make even less of a footprint in the minds of her colleagues. Her way of getting through the day. She checked her pager and saw that she called to visit her old section, where only just over a month before, she was diligent, quiet and clothed.<br><br>She heard the anticipated sounds of her former close colleagues as she opened the door to exit the stairs after her climb from the mezzanine. Since they were talking loudly and laughing, Kimiko decided to remain invisible, just around the corner from them for a moment since she had arrived with forty-five seconds to spare.<br><br>"She was so quiet when she was in this section. Whoever thought she would have what it takes to be a mailgirl," one them commented.<br><br>"But," another argued (a woman?), "she is doing the absolute minimum. The word is that despite clearly being shaved down there, people have only seen a hint that there is even a slit."<br><br>"The world's most modest mailgirl," someone else laughed. "Thought the idea was that they were supposed to be exhibitionists." More laughter.<br><br>This cannot stand, Kimiko decided. She took a deep breath and marched into the cluster of her colleagues.<br><br>"Good morning all," she chirped in a voice that was louder than she had previously used in the office, clothed or otherwise. She shook her fingers out and certain that all eyes were on her, she tweaked her breasts for a moment. Her nipples stood right out, suddenly large and succulent. "How is everybody today?" she continued as she pulled hard on a nipple with one hand and ran the other hand down her flat chest as she spread her legs apart. Reaching her previously hidden parts, she spread her labia. However as she was standing, she couldn't achieve what she wanted. "I guess this could be better," she suggested and leant back on the nearest desk, so that she could raise her legs in the air and then spread them wide while she gave herself some pleasure. This went on for a few moments, keeping her colleagues speechless which did nothing to interrupt her growing louder moans. After she had a mini-orgasm she stood back up, her hands by her sides.<br><br>In her most timid Kimiko voice she asked them "does someone have a pick up for me?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch looked up from his work. Someone had come around the corner into Betty Cuthbert's area of the office. Mitch quickly realised it was a mailgirl and then recognised that it was Jackson. Betty, as expected turned to deliberately look away from her as she passed by and into Mitch's office.<br><br>"Good afternoon," Jackson sang out to Betty as she opened Mitch's door knowing that she was further infuriating her previous friend.<br><br>"Afternoon Mitch," she smiled warmly while feigning a side-on modesty that put her small firm breasts on full display for him. "You have a pick up for me?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "No," he insisted.<br><br>Jackson looked at her device. "That's funny, Shane said here that you had something for me."<br><br>Mitch rolled his eyes. Why had he ever given Shane general access to the mailgirl call system? He knew the answer. Shane had insisted that in case Mitch was away from the office unexpectedly, he needed to have admin rights.<br><br>Jackson plonked herself down in one of the chairs facing Mitch, slouching back low with her legs spread as if that was the only way that she could sit. "Do you think Shane sent me up here on purpose?" she smiled, twirling a finger around a nipple.<br><br>Mitch gave up what he was working on. "You seem to have settled into the role quite well," he smiled at her.<br><br>"It's somewhat less stressful than what I was doing, it's a nice holiday," Jackson smiled.<br><br>"Not too intellectually rigorous?"<br><br>"I'm gaining insights. Learning about the human condition in a way that I never expected."<br><br>"That law degree is coming in useful?"<br><br>Jackson laughed. "Well, I made the rules."<br><br>Mitch smiled at that because it was clearly true. "Did you draft them with any thoughts that you would be here, like this?"<br><br>Jackson lifted her finger off her breast and wagged it at him. "You know that's not how it happened, Mitch."<br><br>Mitch nodded. "Well I better make this worthwhile. Here, I'll give you a note to deliver to Shane." Mitch grabbed a pad, wrote something down and tore off the page, folding it before handing it to Jackson who stood up, walked around the desk to Mitch's side and leaned against Mitch from slightly behind him, pressing one breast against his shoulder blade. She reached down to take the note out of his hand and breathed a warm "thanks" into his ear.<br><br>Jackson straightened up to leave on the errand.<br><br>"Drop around any time you're free," Mitch told her with some feeling.<br><br>The lithe mailgirl turned around to face Mitch front on. "You know," she smiled, "I just might." And she skipped out of the office.<br><br>Mitch shook his head after she had gone around the corner. He could only wonder. This was not how he had ever imagined Jackson to be. He didn't know anything any more.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>They had an arranged meeting in her office, so Mitch went to the ninth floor to meet with Belinda Clarke in the HR section. He was early and was glad to find Kimiko Date just inside the doorway, on the floor, kneeling in the traditional mailgirl pose with her back straight and her legs spread waiting for her next assignment. She had set up near the entrance to the office area on that floor where most of the workers could see her. Perfect, thought Mitch.<br><br>He walked up to her. Of course she had her head down. "I've been hoping to have a chat with you," he stated, quietly enough to make clear that this would be a private conversation. She looked up, surprised, forgetting her unnecessary protocol. Mailgirls didn't look at the boss, at least that was the rule in Japan. Angry with herself, she looked back down. Mitch continued. "What happened, Kimiko?"<br><br>She knew what he was talking about. "Nothing," she murmured into the carpet.<br><br>"Come on," Mitch insisted, "something happened." He squatted down to her level and gave her his caring boss look.<br><br>Kimiko shrugged. "I guess it was when I overheard some of them talking about me. Apparently I was the world's most boring mailgirl. So I decided to show them." Kimiko blushed. "And I have to admit I enjoyed it. Are you telling me off? Am I going too far?"<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "I don't know. I haven't had any complaints, if that's what you meant. But I have to be concerned about your welfare. If I see a member of staff — any member of staff — acting differently, I like to make sure that everything is still all right with them."<br><br>"So no one has complained?"<br><br>"On the contrary, people are talking about you. If we were ranking mailgirls, you would be on top of the table at the moment.<br><br>"The table," Kimiko smiled.<br><br>Mitch laughed. "Oh yes, I hear that you've been on the top of a few tables."<br><br>Kimiko looked back down at the floor. "Of course you don't think I'm the most attractive mailgirl."<br><br>Mitch feigned concern. "Why do you say that?"<br><br>Kimiko mumbled "because you have Jackson."<br><br>Mitch laughed, maybe a little nervously. "More like Jackson has me," he corrected. "But listen, I don't play favourites with you. For a start, I'm a married man."<br><br>Kimiko smiled. "I know all about married men." She gave him a warning look that made him wonder.<br><br>Mitch decided not to pursue that line of discussion. And he was not going to ask her why she had reverted to demure, submissive mailgirl at this time, given what he had heard about her performances elsewhere. He shrugged. Her body, her choice. It was not like he was going to force her to perform.<br><br>Looking at his watch, Mitch gestured that he should get going to meet with Belinda. "My door is always open," he reminded her. Kimiko gave no hint of a response. She was staring at the floor again. So Mitch went on to Belinda's office. As he closed the door he gestured back towards the entrance and the still kneeling mailgirl.<br><br>"She's not always like that," Belinda smiled. Mitch gave her an interested look. "Now, if you had been here yesterday, there was a real performance."<br><br>Mitch looked interested. "Still waters," he mused. And they got on with the meeting.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Another day was over. Mitch arrived home and checked that the house was empty as Jessica had earlier promised him. He took off his office clothes, happy to be free of the trappings of his authority now that the day was done. But he did not put any other clothes on. He wandered naked from his bedroom through the quiet house, through to the room which held some of the relics of their daughters' childhood which the family still called the games room. Mitch assumed the position and waited for his wife to come home. Jessica had messaged him that the girls would not be back until late, so it was 'one of their nights.' He faced away from the entrance kneeling on the floor in the middle of their games room. He would not see anyone come in to the room. But he knew that it would be Jessica. He straightened his back. Something about the trust he had in her.<br><br>He heard Jessica come home and close the front door. Then he heard nothing. She was obviously in another part of the house, apparently taking her time. Of course how much time passes when you are waiting, in an unnatural position, and you cannot see what time it is. Suddenly without warning, Mitch felt a hand on his back. Jessica stood behind him silently for a while. Then she stepped around him, inspecting Mitch as he stared at the floor, waiting still. She tapped his erection with the tip of her finger and laughed. "That's why we don't have mailboys," she smiled. After all his erection was super hard and poking out from his body, in need of attention.<br><br>Mitch smiled.<br><br>"How was your day?" Jessica asked as she always did while she nudged his legs wider and straightened his back.<br><br>"The usual," Mitch answered casually. "Jackson teased me whenever she got the chance. She came into my office on a pretext in the morning. She sat down, spread her legs as she discussed how she was going to run a tribunal hearing. Some minor infraction. It's all distracting me from my work, maybe a little too much."<br><br>"Go on," urged Jessica, "give me the details."<br><br>Mitch knew which part of the story Jessica wanted to hear. "As she explained how she would run the tribunal — one of the stockroom boys had been inappropriate with a mailgirl, allegedly, he had said a few stupid things to her, Jackson was opening and closing her legs. And as she reminded me that the mailgirls on the tribunal would of course be nude while they questioned the stockroom boy, she took a finger, licked it and put it inside herself."<br><br>"Put it inside herself," Jessica mocked. She stiffened her mood. "Did she wank herself with it?"<br><br>Mitch sighed. "I guess you could say that she did," he conceded. In his memory, she was pumping two fingers into herself. But he was not sure if that was real or his fantasy. He had been trying to concentrate at the time on what she was telling him. Which was that he should attend the tribunal, to see how it operated or some such reason.<br><br>"Why don't you just fuck her?" Jessica asked bluntly as she took off her clothes, using a tone suggesting that she had worked out the best possible solution for her husband.<br><br>"It would be like having an affair," Mitch pointed out.<br><br>"No, it would be having an affair," Jessica corrected as she lowered her underwear. She was now also completely naked.<br><br>"Right," Mitch agreed, correcting himself. "It would be having an affair."<br><br>Jessica knelt down and took him in her mouth. They had an understanding that she would relieve him first given the situation he was trapped in at work. But Mitch knew that he would have to reward her well for that concession.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jessica smiled at Mitch as they faced each other across the table all the way through dinner.<br><br>Finally Mitch gave in. "What?" he asked his wife.<br><br>The radiance of her smile remained. "Who would have thought that mailgirls would be good for our sex life," she smirked.<br><br>"Good for your sex life," Mitch complained.<br><br>"My poor boy," Jessica consoled him after a moment or two. "That's what happens after more than a few years of marriage."<br><br>"So what we were talking about earlier. Do I have your permission?" Mitch probed.<br><br>"Permission for what?" Jessica teased.<br><br>"Were you giving me permission to mess around with the mailgirls at work?"<br><br>"Ah, we're talking about your Circe. Why not bring her home? First I'd like to meet my competition. Then we could do whatever comes next in a controlled environment."<br><br>"Yes, that seems like a perfectly insane idea. Why don't I ask her?"<br><br>They ate for a while.<br><br>"By the way," Mitch asked, "where are the children."<br><br>Jessica shrugged. "I gave them a hundred dollars and told them to go out and get into trouble."<br><br>Mitch tried to smile. "It's nice to spend some time together, just the two of us and not have to worry about what the children are getting up to."<br><br>Mitch was nude. Jessica was fully dressed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson sat at Mitch's round table. "You realise that I am just a humble mailgirl who takes messages from one part of your office to another," she smiled, leafing through the pile of papers on the table in front of her.<br><br>Mitch smiled. "You realise that you're the only person in the office who understands this stuff."<br><br>Jackson poked him further. "You do have an HR department."<br><br>"Yes, Belinda personally delivered this lot to me and said, quote, unquote, no one in the section has any idea."<br><br>Jackson read through the covering letter, nodding as she did. She then turned to Mitch suddenly. "Are you looking at my tits?" She straightened up and turned to face him, ensuring that her bust was on full display to him.<br><br>Mitch smiled. It was not worth trying to deny it or make any excuse. He made a point of looking into her eyes and then dropping his gaze to take in the view.<br><br>"Well here they are," Jackson teased, playing with her nipples for a moment then dramatically throwing her head back and letting out a moan. She held that pose pulling on her nipples for a moment. Then she went back to looking at the documents. "Now where were we?" she asked in her controlling voice.<br><br>"My wife's been asking about you," Mitch tried.<br><br>Jackson stopped her work and looked over to him apparently ready to start the self stimulation again. "Oh really?" she challenged. "What sort of interest does she have in me?"<br><br>"I think she would like to meet you, size you up. Maybe have you over for dinner."<br><br>"She suggested that? All the things a concerned wife would do if she were worried about an office dalliance."<br><br>"Dalliance?"<br><br>"What would you call it?"<br><br>"If I knew what it was I might have a name for it."<br><br>They both laughed. Then Jackson got serious first. "If I was to come for dinner, there would be no talk about the office. Or this." She swept her arm theatrically along her bare torso. "And you would not be surprised that I would be demurely dressed up like a nun. I think I would be quite able to cause more problems with a visit to your home than I might be creating in your wife's imagination at the moment." Jackson paused for a moment. Then she added "and yours."<br><br>She lifted up the cover letter to reread it. Clearly they were back to the job at hand.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch looked up when he heard his office door open. Jan Stephenson stood there with a smile on her face and nothing else on. Mitch smiled at her so she took a step in, her tight abs highlighted in the sharp office downlights.<br><br>"I just wanted you to know I took three minutes off my PB on the weekend," she gleamed.<br><br>"That's great," Mitch tried, "what was the event?"<br><br>"Triathlon. Coach said that my technique is improving too." Mitch nodded in approval. Catching that Jan turned around, looked over her shoulder and flexed her muscular buttocks at him. In case he missed it, she did the same again. "I couldn't do that two months ago," Jan boasted.<br><br>"Very impressive," Mitch agreed.<br><br>"Nothing like that stair work." Jan clenched up her buttocks and her hamstrings to prove it.<br><br>"Indeed," Mitch admired, wondering what he could say to convince her that he really was impressed with her muscular show. And for it to finish.<br><br>Jan dropped her smile. "You really must be very busy. Sorry to disturb, I'll leave you to it." She turned to exit then bent from the waist to touch her toes in a show of pure physique. She straightened up turned back to Mitch and blew him a kiss, suddenly acting quite feminine. "I really do appreciate this chance to be the best that I can," she oozed.<br><br>"And I'm glad we can offer it to you," Mitch answered a little too automatically, wondering as he did whether he was showing his workers enough that he cared.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>With nothing on her app, Jackson took the stairs back down to the mezzanine. She sighed as she opened the door into the room causing Lauryn to look up from her laptop.<br><br>"What's up?" Lauryn asked her.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "I am so wet."<br><br>Shaking her head in amusement, Lauryn asked "what have you been up to now? Have you been teasing the boss again?" With a wide smile Jackson nodded. Lauryn closed her laptop and moved it away, to make space. "Want me to help you with that?"<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "Yeah, why not?"<br><br>Lauryn licked her lips. "Good that you're so enthusiastic. You hot bitch."<br><br>Jackson stepped over the bench and gave Lauryn a long kiss. Lauryn broke away to push the slim mailgirl onto her back so that she had easy access to her erect nipples first and then to her pussy. "You are absolutely soaked," Lauryn confirmed as she worked two fingers easily into Jackson who writhed under the other mailgirl's attention. It did not take long. She came strongly as Lauryn worked her tongue in all the right places. After a few more moments, Lauryn relented and Jackson propped herself up on her elbows.<br><br>"Shit, I needed that," Jackson exclaimed. She then laughingly confided that Shane kept sending her to Mitch's office giving her so many opportunities to tease him. And then added that she was still helping Mitch with the regulatory mailgirls stuff.<br><br>"Shane is absolutely enjoying this whole thing," Lauryn agreed. "It's like he thinks we're Team Crawford or something."<br><br>Jackson did not think to explore that. Instead she asked what Lauryn had been doing on her laptop.<br><br>Lauryn smirked. "Yeah, my team have been getting me to help them out too. With the stuff that I used to do. I guess I'm keeping my hand in there as well as with Shane's demands."<br><br>Jackson laughed. "We are being exploited. On so many levels," she agreed.<br><br>And in her post orgasm high, she did not read Lauryn's look that said 'possibly more than you realise.' Instead she checked her app to make sure that she had not missed her next delivery.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch wandered back to his office after a meeting and sat down, preparing himself to start his next task. Betty Cuthbert came to his door and of course he waved her in and encouraged her to sit down with him.<br><br>"You look worried, Betty," he commented.<br><br>Betty gave him a serious look. "I am. I haven't seen anyone do any work recently. Are you sure we can carry on like this?"<br><br>With a swish, the tall athletic figure of Jan entered Mitch's office with a document for him. She stopped part way in realising who Mitch had with him. "Hi Betty," she called out sweetly as she stepped up carefully next to Betty to place the document on Mitch's desk and started to retreat immediately.<br><br>"Yeah hi," Betty grumbled. Knowing that Betty would not turn, Jan went on pointe, flexed her bottom at Mitch, then reached over and pretended to hump the doorframe.<br><br>Mitch looked beseechingly at Betty. "They're trying to be friendly to you," he tried.<br><br>Betty glared back. "No, they're trying to get a reaction from me. They won't get it. And what are you grinning at?"<br><br>"Nothing," Mitch dissembled. Jan was back on pointe, her buttocks twitching in turn as proof of her new found prowess. Sensing it was time, she skipped out and around the corner.<br><br>"And what's that?" Betty snapped, gesturing at the envelope on Mitch's desk.<br><br>Mitch opened it and read it. "It's from Shane confirming the defence people for tomorrow. They liked the proposal. And just to assure you, it's worth about a billion dollars if the meeting goes well. We are getting some things done here."<br><br>Betty Cuthbert harrumphed. "I just hope there's not too many distractions."<br><br>Silently Mitch hoped that she was right.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The next morning, Mitch and Shane were prepping for their meeting with the defence people later in the day.<br><br>"You know that the folk coming to meet us want to see a mailgirl," Shane suggested.<br><br>"Sorry," Mitch came back at him, "are you suggesting that this contract hinges on whether some visitors to our office see a naked woman or two here?"<br><br>"That's exactly what I'm suggesting," Shane enthused. "I'll organise for a pick up during the meeting. We'll act like it's most normal thing in the world, they'll be impressed and presto, contract signed and money in the bank."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "I'm not sure I can even start to articulate what is wrong with that plan, Shane."<br><br>"Great, so I'll organise it," Shane enthused. Mitch groaned, certain that he was going to regret it. He put that thought to one side as they had a presentation to polish.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was furious after the defence contractor meeting. He dropped his normal placid demeanour and did not care what the others thought of it. He called Shane and Wendy Turnbull into his office. He stood behind his desk, glowering down at the two of them who were sitting, trying to be calm, waiting. "Whose idea was it to send in the mailgirl with No War written on her chest?" he shouted at them.<br><br>Wendy looked to her feet. "It wouldn't have mattered," she mumbled.<br><br>Mitch glared at her. "Why not?"<br><br>Wendy continued. "They all had No War on their chests today. They talk."<br><br>Mitch gestured wildly. "Oh great. Who's going to tell them that they probably cost the company $1 billion? How are they going to make that up with productivity savings?"<br><br>Shane spoke up. "Well..." he started.<br><br>Mitch turned on him. "Well what?" he snapped.<br><br>Shane for some reason seemed immune to Mitch's rage. He held out a thick document, pointed it towards Mitch. "Lauryn Mark just gave me this report for you to read. Apparently the components we were trying to sell to Defence can also be used for renewable energy."<br><br>Mitch looked at the report cautiously. He was still steaming. "Who wrote this report? Why haven't I seen it?" he demanded.<br><br>Shane had the answer as he opened the report and skimmed the executive summary. "She did. Remember, Lauryn was originally employed by us as a business analyst, and this is her area of speciality. And she has also attached a list of companies to contact. She has projected sales of $2 billion based on the expected growth of the renewables market in the next five years. It's all in the report."<br><br>Mitch was still angry. "So why hasn't she told us about this before?"<br><br>Wendy spoke up carefully. "She has an answer for that which you may not like. She says that you never took any notice of her work when she had her clothes on."<br><br>Mitch sat down and shook his head. He sat silent while the other two waited. Eventually he shook his head. "This company," he grimaced.<br><br>Shane looked to Wendy as he placed the report in front of Mitch, on his desk. Shane gestured to her that it was a good time to leave.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mid afternoon, Kimiko Date rapped lightly on Mitchell Johnson's office door. He gestured for her to come in and obeying she slunk in a few steps. "Do you want me to kneel?" she asked, looking at the floor rather than at Mitch.<br><br>"No," Mitch replied immediately. "That's not how I do things here. I hoped that you knew that."<br><br>Kimiko nodded and stepped a little closer. "Have I upset Betty Cuthbert?" she asked just as softly.<br><br>"No, that's how she always is." Mitch gestured to the chairs facing his desk.<br><br>Kimiko slid into one of the chairs and wriggled herself so that she was sitting straight, her pert breasts gently swaying for a moment.<br><br>Mitch smiled at her. "Thanks for coming in, I thought it was time that we had a talk. I'm trying to check on how everyone is doing after the first month."<br><br>"Hmm," Kimiko replied. She relaxed, pushing her chair back so that she could slouch comfortably. She hooked one leg over the armrest which exposed her to Mitch. After licking a finger lasciviously, she ran it down her chest, over her mound and ran it through her slit. "This area needs a dildo station," she suggested, using one finger and then another on her clit in lieu of having an office supplied tool at hand.<br><br>"That's not going to happen," Mitch replied with a smile and a gesture towards the back of Betty Cuthbert's head as she worked at her desk.<br><br>"What would you like to talk to me about?" Kimiko asked as she buried a finger right into her vagina.<br><br>Mitch was impressed at how she could carry on their conversation while getting herself off as if that was how interactions now occurred in the office. He remembered himself enough to ask "have you considered your future?"<br><br>Kimiko removed her finger, but it turned out that was so she could pinch both her nipples at the same time while keeping her legs spread for Mitch's apparent enjoyment. "Oh, it is that sort of talk," Kimiko mocked, raising her voice a little and giving Mitch a sardonic look. "Is this because you are concerned about my behaviour?" She ran both hands down to her pussy and proceeded to work away at her clit and vagina at the same time. "Am I concerned about my behaviour? No, in this role, I only consider the present." She stopped for a moment to let a minor orgasm ripple through her. Then she continued calmly as before "Oh, you maybe think that me being a mailgirl will make things hard for me in the years to come and I will find it hard to get a normal job? Are you applying a misogynistic stereotype to me? Are you worried I am becoming a sex maniac or something?" Kimiko stopped wanking for a moment and licked a finger on each hand, making a show of it for her audience of one. She looked hard at Mitch daring him to contradict her.<br><br>Mitch said nothing and tried to look managerial, expecting that he was failing at that, given the performance in front of him.<br><br>"How are things going with Jackson?" Kimiko asked in her soft yet probing way. "Does she do this for you?" Kimiko swung around in the chair until she was kneeling on it, facing away to give Mitch an unobstructed view of her pussy and her bottom hole. She smiled over her shoulder at him.<br><br>"I do run a large business," Mitch answered, trying to sound light hearted about it.<br><br>Kimiko missed the mood as she swung back to sit down, again with her leg spread over the armrest. "That's not how it looks to me," she purred as she went back to masturbating. Mitch raised an eyebrow, a question. "From here it looks like a circus with naked women running all over the place. I wouldn't be surprised if it was all shut down."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "You don't have to be worried about that. We're funded by head office."<br><br>"For their amusement?"<br><br>"Something like that I expect."<br><br>"I worked in head office, as you are aware. They do not smile very often."<br><br>"I think we can make them smile," Mitch answered, wondering if that was actually true.<br><br>"You may find that harder than you think," Kimiko whispered as if she knew something that Mitch didn't.<br><br>"Well, you know them," Mitch agreed.<br><br>"Indeed," rejoined Kimiko with a strange look on her face. Mitch decided to dismiss it. Maybe she was just getting off on the conversation and from her wanking.<br><br>Kimoko reached an orgasm and when it finished she slumped down in the chair. "Sorry," she said meekly, looking down at the floor. "This was supposed to be a talk about my performance? How well am I doing?" Back to the quiet, shy Kimiko, a total change in demeanour.<br><br>Mitch smiled. "I am always trying to work out what you are thinking."<br><br>Kimiko smiled but privately as she maintained her submission. "And what am I thinking now?" she again whispered.<br><br>Mitch conceded "I have absolutely no idea."<br><br>"Do you have any problems with my work?" Kimiko asked.<br><br>Mitch looked at his screen, at the app and checked her progress report. "No, your work looks pretty good, based on your stats. But I want to know how you feel about what you are doing here."<br><br>Kimiko sat up straight, her legs on the floor and her hands by her side. She looked Mitch seriously in the eyes. "For the first time, I feel truly that I am in the right place." On that she was quite emphatic.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane burst into Mitch's office with a bottle of red and two long stem glasses. "You have to try this beauty," he insisted.<br><br>Mitch looked up from the report he'd been reading. "It's four o'clock, Shane."<br><br>"Ten past," Shane corrected. "Just one glass, a taste, to agree I'm on a winner with this one."<br><br>Mitch groaned as Shane plonked the glass for Mitch on top of the report that he had open on his desk. Shane had the bottle open and had poured before Mitch could react in any way. "Got to let it breathe for a moment," Shane warned as he held his own glass up to his nose. "Smells promising," he reported.<br><br>Mitch gave up any protest and took up his glass for a sniff. "I can tell it's not off," he replied.<br><br>Shane laughed. "You have the best nose for wine that I know," he insisted.<br><br>"Okay," Mitch relaxed, "how much was it?"<br><br>"Seventy-five dollars," Shane shrugged, "and worth every cent." He took a sip and nodded his appreciation. And then looked back to make sure that Mitch's door was closed and that Betty Cuthbert was otherwise engaged. "How are you getting on with the mailgirls?"<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "I see them, we talk. You send them to my office on a regular basis, in case you had forgotten."<br><br>Shane looked concerned. "You're the boss. You're supposed to be taking advantage of your position, what with a horde of naked women in your office."<br><br>Mitch shrugged like it really did not occur to him. "They all think I'm getting it off with Jackson."<br><br>"Well you are," Shane retorted. And then studied Mitch's face for a moment, hoping for a confirmation. There was no confirmation. Reading his boss, Shane shook his head. "Well, I wonder who is then," he concluded.<br><br>Mitch looked hard at Shane like he really did not understand him. "Shane, you're a married man with kids."<br><br>Shane was not ruffled by that. "And with all those horny nude women in the office all day." He widened his eyes at Mitch. "Let's call one in now." And got out his phone. "Who do you want to see?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "You know, I take my wedding vows pretty seriously."<br><br>"And then temptation comes along," Shane taunted him, walking his fingers across the desk towards his boss.<br><br>Mitch sighed. "Yes, I had noticed that. But I guess I can be strong about this. I mean, who knows what would happen if we gave in..."<br><br>Shane smiled. "We?"<br><br>Mitch looked shocked. "You mean?" he spluttered.<br><br>Shane shrugged. "Some of us are only human." He thought for a moment and then looked completely satisfied. "It was all completely consensual."<br><br>"Shane, why aren't you up in front of the tribunal?"<br><br>"Because I play by the rules. You know what's in the contract. I do what they tell me to."<br><br>Mitch shook his head while Shane grinned at him.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Betty Cuthbert was sitting with Mitch in his office for their weekly status meeting, her laptop open on his desk so she could update anything if it came up during their discussion.<br><br>"You see," Mitch told her, "there's been nothing in the press, no harassment of our staff, and no reporters have bothered to contact me for a while. All we had to do was sit tight and see it out."<br><br>Betty Cuthbert looked unimpressed.<br><br>Mitch continued, knowing he was trying to convince himself as much as he was Betty. "The world has moved on, they have found much more interesting things." Betty gave him her look. "What?" he asked her.<br><br>"Mr Harada is about to visit again. Remember what happened last time?"<br><br>Mitch gave her an acknowledging look. "That's what I'm talking about, to quote Shane. It blew up then and it went away."<br><br>Betty struggled for the words to reply to that. "Then there weren't, there wasn't the situation there is now."<br><br>Mitch nodded. He reminded Betty that with the help of some judiciously worded statements from Jackson, the press had been discretely warned of the penalties associated with worker privacy breaches under the Fair Work Act which had apparently worked. Social media had nothing to feed on after the hoo-ha caused by Mr Harada's announcement because there were no pictures, for a start.<br><br>The Age had tried to turn Harada Industry's Fair Work Agreement with the mailgirls into a story since the agreement was a published document. They reported the most salacious details and asked Mitch for a comment that they didn't get. But with no photos and no quotes from anyone affected, they did not seem have put much effort into the story and it ran deep in the paper and was almost impossible to find in the business section of their website. No one, it seemed, really cared about a private company that no one had heard of before it introduced mailgirls and no one seemed interested now, so long as there was no kindling. Even The Hun had been unable to come up with anything to confect any outrage.<br><br>Mitch had his radar up. He knew that Four Corners had some poor resolution footage of the Emily protest — although he did not know it was Emily — which they were reluctant to use as being unable to identify her, they did not know whether she was of age. And apart from that they had little more than The Age had. ACA had been waving their chequebook around but with absolutely no success. All anyone had was the footage of Mr Harada in the foyer saying it would happen. And his press statement saying that it had. No one outside the building could even be certain that the program was running. Somehow, all the workers at Harada and BAD Solutions had kept it from leaking through friends and teammates. Maybe, just maybe, they would get through this.<br><br>Now, if only he could make Betty Cuthbert believe him.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Cara Johnson wondered what was going on with the mailgirls program. Her father had given the twins no inkling of what was happening in the office since Emily had found out that she was not on the shortlist. Cara walked into her sister's bedroom unannounced as usual finding Emily standing nude on tiptoes.<br><br>"What's doing sis? How's the protest going?" she asked like their situation was the most natural in the world.<br><br>Emily gave her a wicked smile. "We've gone underground. Want to join in?"<br><br>"Amazing the video hasn't leaked," Cara reminded her and got a pout.<br><br>"I trust the others in the resistance," she insisted.<br><br>Cara gave her a knowing smile. "Trust no one," she suggested.<br><br>"You do things your way, I'll do them mine," Emily responded. She flexed her calves. "This position is worse than the other one," she complained. "I don't know how they do it."<br><br>Cara walked around her, inspecting how her sister was standing. "Why are your hands behind your back," she asked.<br><br>"I'm imagining that they are tied together or handcuffed or something."<br><br>Cara thought about that. "I would have you with your hands by your side," she suggested.<br><br>"Really?" asked Emily, "why?"<br><br>"That makes it easier to punish you on your bottom. Your hands aren't in the way." Cara thought for a moment. "I'm sure that's how they are in the Japanese videos."<br><br>"Oh," Emily nodded, "I don't think I have seen those. But you're probably right." She moved her hands to her sides. "Definitely this," she agreed. "This is much more uncomfortable." Cara stood staring at her sister for a while, smiling as Emily winced with the pain rising from her feet and the stiffness now running from her shoulders to her fingers. "Will you punish me?" Emily asked.<br><br>Cara crossed her arms and looked warmly at her sister. "No," she teased, "I'm not going to." She shook her head. "I don't get it. Why are you doing this?"<br><br>Emily smiled then winced. "You have no idea how hot this is."<br><br>Cara shook her head again and left her sister to it.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>With the dates confirmed, Mitch sent out an office-wide email warning that Mr Harada was visiting for two days starting from Monday. Mitch knew that he would have to address the mailgirls the next morning as he knew that not all of them were bothering to check their email accounts. After all, why should they? They could let the app govern their workdays, and they did not have to care about anything else if they chose not to.<br><br>Mitch informed them in the gym as they were getting ready. For once they had all presented to work that morning. He felt the frisson of being surrounded by six naked women who were unashamedly preparing themselves for the day. Jan who insisted on keeping her pussy completely bare, had her legs spread on the bench right close to Mitch as she wielded her razor. She looked up and smiled at Mitch then checked her pussy for errant hairs before starting on her legs. Wendy Turnbull lurked in the background, pretty much superfluous. She was supposed to inspect them at eight o'clock before they went on duty but as she had complained to Mitch there was little to inspect. The mailgirls were self sufficient and the rules were loose enough that they were almost never going to break them, unless they decided that they wanted to.<br><br>"So?" asked Jan looking up to Mitch as she finished shaving her legs, "why does any of that matter to us?"<br><br>Mitch smiled knowing not to show any exasperation. "Because mailgirls is his baby, if I can put it like that. He is coming here primarily to see how the program is running. So it does kind of matter to you."<br><br>"And if he doesn't like what he sees?" Lauryn asked Mitch.<br><br>Mitch sighed. "He can wind the program up. After all, he's paying for it."<br><br>The rest of the mailgirls looked over to Jackson who was stretching in a corner. She knew why. "If he does that the company would still have to pay our contracts out," she reported to general affirmation. She smiled at Mitch with a look on her face that seemed to say to him, this is what you and I have done.<br><br>Heather saw an opportunity for her ambition. "They can't move us overseas and make us American or Japanese mailgirls then?" she asked. There was more than a little hope in her question.<br><br>Jackson faced the room, blithely doing a knee stretch that opened her crotch for Mitch's view as he looked over to see what she would say to that. "Our contracts don't allow it," she reported. "We are Melbourne mailgirls only. With a Sydney option we can take if the company ever extends the program there."<br><br>Annette joined in the discussion. "How does Sydney sound, Heather?" she teased. "The New York of the south?"<br><br>Amid the laughter, Heather tried to convince them that one day she would be a mailgirl in New York. The others were not convinced. "You'll see," she glowered, not entirely convincingly. She looked to Jackson with hope, but Jackson shrugged back at her meaning no.<br><br>Lauryn waited for that to settle down, a moment of relative quiet to question Mitch further. "So we can just do our work as usual on the big day and Mr High-and-Mighty can like it or lump it?" She looked over to Kimiko who was bent over concentrating on her nails or simply trying to stay out of the situation. "Kimiko," Lauryn called to her, "how do you think he'll take it?"<br><br>They all looked over at Kimiko who looked up as if she had just realised that they were all there. She shrugged and went back to inspecting her nails before looking away at the mirror to confirm that her appearance was up to her standards. She spread her legs and looked closely at her pussy, screwed her face up and tweezered a hair off her now completely bare mound.<br><br>"Well, that's settled then," Mitch concluded, worrying privately what ideas the mailgirls may have in mind for Mr Harada's visit, after the No War episode. Better not to dwell nor say anything further to provoke them, as he knew he would not find out if they had any plans until it was too late.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>It was ten o'clock. Mitch knew that Mr Harada was due any moment and was mostly ready for him.. But somehow Mr Harada took him by surprise when he strode into Mitch's office flanked by an immaculate young man and an equally immaculate young woman who both wore the most serious looks, both dressed in dark suits that matched Mr Harada's for quality and cut. Mr Harada waved his assistants away and they left Mitch's office, to speak with Betty Cuthbert who led them out of the area.<br><br>Mitch tried to guess Mr Harada's mood. He did not have to wait more than a moment.<br><br>"I am not happy with your mailgirl rules," Mr Harada told Mitch who still stood as he sat himself down in front of his Australian manager. Mitch stood and waited.<br><br>"Which rules?" Mitch asked after waiting a moment to see if Mr Harada had finished.<br><br>Mr Harada spoke up. "You are aware of the rules that we have in Japan and the US for our mailgirls. We made those rules for a reason. Yet I see that your rules are almost the opposite of what we have shown to work."<br><br>Mitch tried to point out how Australian labour law meant that he had to take a different approach than the other two programs. "But it is working out well," he suggested without much support for that assertion.<br><br>"I did not see any mailgirls on my way in," Mr Harada harrumphed.<br><br>Mitch decided to try to fix that. "Let's see if there are any in their change room at the moment. Mitch led Mr Harada past Betty Cuthbert's still empty seat to the window that looked out on the mezzanine and the foyer. Two mailgirls were visible, both typing on their laptops. Mitch pointed at the closer one who had squatted on the bench with her legs spread facing their way but engrossed in her laptop. "That's Lauryn," Mitch informed his boss. "She's helping out her old team, she was a business analyst. They have a report due tomorrow afternoon, so she's pitching in when she's free and not on a delivery." Mitch did not add that she was off the call list until her work was done because they needed her expertise if the report had any chance of being completed successfully.<br><br>Mr Harada grunted an acknowledgement.<br><br>Mitch continued. "And Annette over there..." who had stretched out on her front on the other bench with her face close to her laptop, "she is doing an online economics course in her downtime. She fits it in between her calls."<br><br>Mr Harada seemed to be impressed when she let one leg slip down the side of the bench exposing herself — unknowingly — to Mr Harada and Mitch and to anyone else who may be watching from any of the upper floors as she maintained her concentration on her coursework.<br><br>Mr Harada kept his watch over the two in the change room. "So the other four are delivering mail or waiting on the other floors?" he asked.<br><br>Mitch checked the app on his phone. It told him that two of the mailgirls were currently on jobs, that Heather was on period leave and Jan had the day off for unspecified personal leave. Which meant, he felt with a pang, that Jackson was naked somewhere on another floor. Should he tell Mr Harada about this? Why not? Mitch explained the situation to him.<br><br>Mr Harada, already unhappy, was even less happy that there were only two other mailgirls there and made that clear. Mitch tried to explain that the leave the two absent mailgirls had taken was a minimum employment condition in Australia.<br><br>Mr Harada's face tightened. "Does anybody work in this country?" he demanded. Mitch decided to try to placate him by starting to recite his practised outline of how the Australian operation was running.<br><br>Mr Harada let him run on for a while before stopping him. "Since this is my company, I'll go for a walk around the office," he announced. "Am I allowed to do that in this country?" he growled.<br><br>Betty Cuthbert came back as Mr Harada walked out, nodded officiously to him and told Mitch that she had found spare desks for Mr Harada's assistants to work at. She gritted her teeth at the company owner when he was safely around the corner to Mitch's amusement. When Mr Harada returned to Mitch's office he smiled politely at the stolid Betty but looked a bit more comfortable. He walked in on Mitch and sat at his desk, somewhat relaxed. "I am pleasantly surprised by the level of diligence that I saw in the office. Perhaps I may have been a bit premature about your changes to the program. Now I would like to visit your IT contractors on the lower floor. I'm curious about their level of capability."<br><br>Mitch relaxed too. "I'll take you down there and introduce you to them." He called to confirm that their CEO would be available for a visit. On the way down, Mitch explained that the IT company also used their mailgirls and got a nod of approval for that revelation.<br><br>Mitch led Mr Harada out of the lift, past BAD Solutions' receptionist who smiled at him, and they turned the corner to the CEO's office together. They both saw the mailgirl in the kneeling position, naked, flawless and pale, her firm breasts proudly forward, with her legs spread so she knew that she was completely exposed to anyone who could see her, waiting patiently outside the office of the CEO.<br><br>Ah, Mitch thought, she is in that sort of mood at the moment.<br><br>Mr Harada smiled at him. "Now that is a mailgirl." Mitch chose not to reply to that, waiting for Mr Harada to expand. "You see," he continued, "with proper training and the right attitude, your mailgirls can reach the same standards as the ones we have in Japan and in the US." Mitch again decided to stay silent. Better to not give Mr Harada any false expectations about his unpredictable employee.<br><br>They came close to her. The mailgirl stayed in total submission looking down at the floor, absolutely still, her long thick black hair partially obscuring her face. "Hi Kimiko," Mitch smiled as they reached her. Startled, she looked up, and seeing the two men a shot of fear opened her eyes wide. Wondering what was wrong, Mitch looked to her, then to his boss, then again to her.<br><br>Mr Harada seemed to be equally as shocked as the quivering mailgirl, his face tight with confusion. He stared at her open mouthed for a long moment. "Kimiko," he demanded once he had almost recomposed himself but still with a tremor in his voice, "what are you doing here?"<br><br>To be continued...`

                    content: `Mitch looked up from his work awakened by a knock on his door. It was Jackson, so of course he waved her in. Jackson swanned into the room seductively. She licked her lower lip as she approached Mitch who tried to look unaffected by her performance. Jackson tilted her head back as if in ecstacy as she squeezed a nipple then ran her hand down to her crotch. She made eye contact with Mitch as she fingered her clit for a moment. Then she stopped and smiled.<br><br>"Oh yeah, I have a message for you," she smiled, "now what was it?" She placed her hands behind her head and outstretched one knee. She held that pose with her legs spread for a moment. "You know that you can just give in," she smiled at Mitch salaciously. Mitch shook his head with a wry composure.<br><br>"Do you know anything about Kimiko?" he asked her.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "I asked her, but she said nothing." She gave up on the posing and sat down in the seat facing the office boss, across his desk from him.<br><br>"Do you have any ideas?" Mitch saw Jackson as much as an ally in the office as a determined object of his desire. She shook her head at that too. "Anything else of interest?" he tried.<br><br>"Oh yeah, the message," Jackson recalled. "Shane told me he wants you to come to his office," she reported. "He says it's urgent," she added with a smirk.<br><br>"What's he up to now?" Mitch assumed that Jackson knew everything that mattered in the office.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "I guess you'll just have to see."<br><br>Mitch sighed and organised himself to go up to the tenth floor to find what his deputy wanted.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>While most of the department got on with their work concentrating on their screens, Lauryn Marks swivelled around in the office chair that was once hers, sitting at her old desk from her pre-mailgirls days in Harada Industries' Business Analytics department. She was of course naked, as she was one of the six mailgirls employed in Harada Industries' Melbourne office. She smiled knowingly at the man sitting at the workstation next to her. "Your office politics and carry-ons take on a whole new perspective ever since I started to dress like this," she announced, gesturing how her bare body was on display to him. "Was I doing all that, the gossip, the intrigues, back in my fabric days?"<br><br>Michael slouched back in his chair as usual and gave Lauryn an incongruous serious look. "Do you miss your old desk?" he asked. It was unoccupied, exactly as it was when she had cleared it before starting on her new role.<br><br>Lauryn smiled at her familiar colleague. "You mean do I miss the days when I came to work each day, sat here, and kept my clothes on?" She let that issue hang and instead wheeled her chair over right up close to Michael and reached over to adjust his tie. "The way you tie your tie has been bugging me for years," she laughed. Michael seemed a little nervous with his naked co-worker so close to him. She seemed not to notice as she attempted to improve his neckwear. After trying to fix it, she gave up, loosened it and pulled it off Michael's neck, unravelled it and inching closer to her clothed colleague, she expertly retied it. "There," she announced as her breasts jiggled, so close to his face but unabashed by her display, "done."<br><br>Michael felt the newly corrected tie around his neck and acknoledged that it was now more comfortable. "How did you know how to do that?" he asked, trying to concentrate on her face.<br><br>Lauryn shrugged as she skidded her chair back to her old desk. "I went to that sort of school. So I got good at getting it right every day. It's a habit. They said it would help me with my career." She lifted her breasts, playing with the undersides. "But I'm not sure they had this role in mind. All I have to get right each day is this." Lauryn spread her legs to show how smoothly she was shaved bare of any pubic hair. She winked at Michael. "Did you ever want to see me like this?"<br><br>Michael unashamedly stared as he absorbed the whole picture, his former colleague sitting back where she used to be but nude and showing herself off. "Well, I wouldn't have passed up the chance," he admitted boldly.<br><br>Lauryn got up out of her old seat and stepped over to face Michael, sitting on the corner of his desk, so close to him although knowing that he would not dare to touch her, in line with the office rules. She spread her legs wide as she reclined back on the desk. The mailgirls had decided that this pose was a suitable level of provocation and broadly in line with their role to inspire the other staff. Leaning back on their summoners' desks hands behind them on the desk for support, legs spread and breasts thrust up. As they had agreed amongst themselves, wasn't that what the management wanted? Were they not there to stimulate the other workers to be better employees? Lauryn smiled down at Michael who appeared not to be too fussed by her pose, so she sat back up and closed her legs.<br><br>Michael shrugged at his former close colleague like he was now used to her working naked in the office. "What's up with Kimiko and Mr Harada?" he asked her. That encounter had naturally been news right through the office. Everyone knew that Mr Harada had recognised her, said her name and asked her what she was doing.<br><br>Lauryn shrugged at that. "I wish I knew," she admitted. "She's not talking about it."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette Kellerman eased past Mitch as he entered Shane's office. "Everything all right?" he asked her since the lithe red-haired mailgirl looked a little dishevelled and seemed intent on avoiding eye contact with him.<br><br>"Yeah, sure," she mumbled looking away from him to the side, in a way that indicated she was not going to tell him if anything was wrong.<br><br>"There is always the tribunal if you need it," Mitch suggested. He looked over to Shane who, relaxed behind his desk, seemed as unruffled as ever.<br><br>"Don't forget that message for Belinda," Shane called to her. She turned around, just outside the door to Shane's office and nodded, apparently happy to look Shane in the eye from a distance. The mailgirl then set off on her task, winding past the IT staff's desks. Mitch was sure that they were ogling her while pretending that they weren't interested.<br><br>Shane smiled after her as she disappeared. "In the US or Japan she would be getting demerits and punishment for being in the office with her hair mussed up like that," he laughed. "Here, the issue is whether she'll get incentive points for getting the message down to HR within the target time."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "You wanted to talk about?" he asked Shane as he sat down opposite him.<br><br>Shane said one word. "Kimiko."<br><br>"Yes?" Shane had his attention.<br><br>And Shane looked serious, or at least as serious as was possible for him. "I've done some digging and got the guff on her. You won't like it."<br><br>"Tell me," Mitch asked with a look of resignation.<br><br>Shane looked pleased with himself. "She's his granddaughter."<br><br>Mitch groaned. Mr Harada was his mailgirl's grandfather. That was bad. Then he had a thought, a hope. "Are you sure? The surname."<br><br>Shane shook his head to wipe out that possibility. "Mitch, surnames don't stay the same when you're a daughter of a daughter."<br><br>Mitch nodded his resignation to that fact. He had employed this mailgirl who spent her days naked around their office, who by all reports provided the most intense shows at the dildo stations when she was not otherwise acting as the most submissive of the group, and she just happened to be the granddaughter of the company's owner and founder. Resignation seemed the right feeling especially as Mitch recalled standing next to Mr Harada and experiencing the full reaction of Mr Harada when he recognised Kimiko. But Mitch noticed that Shane did not seem too concerned. Was there hope? "Do you have a plan?" he asked his deputy.<br><br>Shane maintained his composure, like it was no big deal. "Maybe we can sack her for lying on her CV." he suggested.<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "I don't think it's a statutory requirement to list your grandparents on your resume. So you don't have a plan." He thought for a moment. "Well, at least we know what it's about. I'll talk to her."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson strolled into Mitch's office. "You were expecting Kimiko, I guess," she started as she sat down facing Mitch across his desk just how they used to meet back when she was a consultant to the business wearing clothes. Which meant that she was up close to the desk resting her elbows on it, although with her breasts on display to him, now that she was a mailgirl.<br><br>"Well yes," Mitch agreed. "I did ask her in for a chat." He tried to give Jackson the impression that he was not currently interested in her breasts.<br><br>Jackson sat up straight and looked Mitch hard in the eyes. "Kimiko was worried you would be angry so she asked me to attend."<br><br>Mitch relaxed back in his seat. "Why would we be angry?" he replied. Jackson waited to see if Mitch was going to add anything to that. When he didn't, she smiled and then laughed, her breasts shaking just a bit. Mitch laughed too, releasing a bit of his tension.<br><br>Jackson straightened her demeanour. "She expects to be punished," she reported flatly. "That's what she told me."<br><br>"That's not going to happen," Mitch replied equally flatly.<br><br>Jackson shrugged like it wasn't her thing but her duty to report. "She wants to be punished," she repeated. "That's all she told me."<br><br>Mitch rolled his eyes. "Isn't there somewhere she can go and pay for that sort of thing?" he tried.<br><br>Jackson shook her head although she knew where Mitch stood on that issue. "I'm just reporting. She wants to be punished as a mailgirl in the office. She's been watching the Japanese videos."<br><br>Mitch thought about that for a moment. "It runs against everything that we have been trying to with the program here. And it goes against the rules and what we are allowed to do to you. You, of course, know that."<br><br>Jackson stood up and tilted her head in a sort 'I'm thinking this through' gesture. The thin mailgirl walked around to sit on the corner of Mitch's desk, up close to him in the now standard provocative manner. Although rather than reclining back she sat pretty much upright, swinging one leg open with the other anchoring herself to the floor.<br><br>"What are you trying to do?" Mitch asked her softly.<br><br>Jackson spread her legs just a little bit more, exposing herself to the manager of the Australian operations. "I'm just trying to work out a way for you and me to sort this out," she said. Mitch did not flinch, nor did he say anything to try to prise out the meaning or ramifications of that challenge. "Oh well," Jackson concluded and got up from her pose. "I'll talk to Kimiko and report back if there's anything to say. See you later Mitch," she promised as she turned around to give him a view of the curve of her bottom as she exited.<br><br>Don't you love her as she's walking out the door, Mitch thought as Jackson slowly trailed past Betty Cuthbert's desk tossing off her usual greeting to Mitch's PA which as usual Betty Cuthbert chose to ignore acting far too busy in her work to acknowledge the attractive young nude as she made her way out of the office area.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The next morning Mitch was working at his desk when Annette walked in, an unusual smirk on her face. She stopped near the door indicating that she would be quick so she did not need to settle in. "Shane says he needs you in the boardroom urgently," she said with a mysterious glint in her eye.<br><br>Mitch chose to respond straight. It was 10am so not yet time for a red wine tasting. At least he hoped that. Perhaps another brainwave about Kimiko? He started to get ready. "Any idea what for?" he asked the waiting mailgirl.<br><br>Annette screwed up her face, trying not to laugh. Apparently she did know but was under orders not to reveal what. She gave Mitch a look which said that the situation was not her fault.<br><br>"Okay," Mitch surrendered as he got up from his desk. Annette was looking hard at him. "Oh yes," he remembered and marked her call as done on the app. Annette checked her app which pinged just as she did calling her to another errand.<br><br>"Gotta go," she called out to Mitch as she turned and strode past Betty Cuthbert's desk, with the usual non-interaction from Mitch's beleaguered PA.<br><br>"I'll be in the boardroom," Mitch advised Betty.<br><br>"Yes, I heard," she snapped. She was never at her happiest after the appearance of a mailgirl.<br><br>The first thing Mitch noticed in the boardroom was the wrapping mess on the board table. "We had a delivery," Shane told him rather unnecessarily. "From Mr Harada apparently." At that point Mitch noticed a set of six very large prints that Shane had spaced out along the floor around the walls. "Well let's face it, the outback landscapes were looking a bit tired," he laughed waving his hand to where they hung languidly, lifelessly adorning the room like a hundred or more meeting rooms in the city. Mitch was not going to argue with Shane about that. They were so bland he barely noticed them. He took a closer look at the art that Mr Harada had sent. Should anything the owner of the company do surprise him any more? Now that Australia was within the mailgirl orbit, it seemed that plenty of other things would change too.<br><br>Mitch studied the set of matching prints. They were high quality photographs. In the first full length view, a thin naked Japanese woman had her hands bound behind her in a complex roping which also wrapped around her neck and her breasts but left her unobstructed from the waist down. Shane came up close to Mitch to admire it. "I'd say that was taken in Mr Harada's office, judging by the background," Shane noted. "Classy, isn't it? Certainly will add something to the ambiance in this room."<br><br>Annette sidled into the room and stood between Mitch and Shane, hands on bare hips, to also peruse the print that they were studying. "Nice," she agreed, "but not my thing."<br><br>"Are you sure about that?" Shane asked the naked woman who was now standing right next to him. She gave him a sharp warning look. At least that was what Mitch thought he saw but it was all gone before he could fully register.<br><br>"Oh yeah," Annette remembered, "I am actually here with a message. For you, Mitch." She stopped to closely regard the strained posture of the restrained model in the portrait and twisted her own arms back in the pose as she looked at it. "No," she decided as she loosened them back out purposely running one hand across Shane's cheek as she did so. "Ah yes, the message," she remembered. "the Bad boys downstairs got a few of these for their boardroom too. They were just affixing them to their walls when they called me to ask you if you wanted their help in putting this lot up."<br><br>Mitch looked at her a little confused. "Don't we just take this lot down and put the new ones up on the hooks."<br><br>Annette smiled. "That's what they said you would say. Apparently these prints are much heavier than the old stuff. You do that and you'll end up with a hole in the wall where the hook used to be. And a smashed print when it falls off. They have all the necessary gear and they're ready to help you now." She broadened her smile with the knowledge that she was right. What else could he do? Mitch nodded. Annette glanced down at his mobile. He remembered after a moment to record her mission as completed. And then to set up the next one, the return back to the third floor to invite someone up.<br><br>"Thanks," Annette added. "I'm going to get those merit points if it kills me." Mitch looked concerned. "But," she added, "it won't come to that." She stepped away from the two men, wriggled her bum at them as she departed back downstairs.<br><br>Shane shook his head. "I'm trying to remember if things were easier before all this started," he joshed.<br><br>Mitch looked at him, surprised. "You're complaining?"<br><br>Shane laughed. "No, not really."<br><br>But Mitch couldn't resist it. "At least for me, things were a whole lot easier B.G."<br><br>"Beegee?" Shane asked.<br><br>"Before mailgirls."<br><br>Annette returned with one of the tech guys from BAD Solutions who seemed happy to follow her into the room as she pretended not to notice his focus on her bottom and her legs. He did not seem particularly physical to Mitch, but he carried a set of tools with the authority of someone who knew how to use them. "This is Len," Annette happily announced.<br><br>"Annette here said you were going to hang those prints using the old hooks," he chided. "Just as well you got me in, Annette," he smiled.<br><br>"We'll leave you to it," Mitch responded. He and Shane started towards the door. "Annette?" he asked the mailgirl who showed no intent to come with them.<br><br>"Oh, I'm staying, helping Len." She saw the looks on the faces of her managers. "I do this all the time at home."<br><br>"Like that?" asked Shane who seemed genuinely concerned for her. "There must be some health and safety thing about it."<br><br>"Like health and safety wasn't an issue when you two were going to hang them on these hooks," Len soliloquised as he yanked one of the old hooks out of the wall and replaced it with a much more impressive one. Mitch and Shane watched as Annette lifted the large print easily, legs astride as Len apparently impervious to her stance helped her to manoeuvre the print safely into place.<br><br>Annette looked over to see Mitch and Shane still watching. "We'll be good," she stated firmly and smiled sweetly at them. Len had a wide smile too.<br><br>As Shane and Mitch left the boardroom, Shane grabbed his boss by his arm to look seriously at him. "Have you spoken to him yet?" Shane asked.<br><br>Mitch knew what Shane meant. "Not yet." Mr Harada had said nothing to Mitch during the rest of his visit. And Mitch had heard nothing since Mr Harada had returned to Japan, not even the emails he expected were sent in Mr Harada's name to him by his staff.<br><br>Shane shook his head. "You know you're going to have to at some stage." Shane stared at him. "And you are going to have to sort out Kimiko too."<br><br>Mitch nodded vaguely, still trying to work out what to do with the iceberg that could not be avoided.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Given that Kimiko had again avoided a request from Mitch to have a chat about the way things were, he finally gave in to do what Shane would insist was the only thing to do in that situation and used his administrator privileges to summon Kimiko to the boardroom, ostensibly for a message.<br><br>Mitch loitered alone for a few moments in the boardroom, wondering whether Kimiko would respond or perhaps whether she would twig and send Jackson again. He glanced at the walls of the room where in contrast with the cream plaster ambience of the walls, the recently hung prints depicting restrained naked women hinted at a fantasy of a darker milieu. Not for the first time Mitch wondered what was real, his office life or the promise of bondaged naked women that the prints suggested was a part of Mr Harada's workplace experience.<br><br>Kimiko sidled quietly into the room while Mitch was in his reverie so he did not notice her until she had taken her usual kneeling position, in this case not far from the door. Looking downwards, she held that position with her gaze fixed firmly on the floor in front of her. Mitch realised that this was the same pose that her grandfather had discovered her on his floor walk. Mr Harada was back in Japan. And Mitch was still in a dilemma.<br><br>Mitch strode up to Kimiko so that she could not but know that he was standing right close to her.<br><br>"Thank you for coming," he started. He looked down at her imagining her in one of the pictures that Mr Harada had sent, which loomed over him as he tried to connect with the submissive mailgirl. Why had he chosen this place for such a discussion with her? Once again he had to work hard to concentrate on the person in front of him and put a vision of her bound and helpless out of his mind.<br><br>"I did not have a choice, did I?" she replied. She was not going to make this easy, he realised.<br><br>"Kimiko," he stated gently, "you could have taken the day off."<br><br>Kimiko maintained her pose on her knees. And her defensive attitude. "I didn't have a reason."<br><br>Mitch sought to lay on the kindly approach. "I don't want to tell you off. For a start, there is nothing to tell you off about as you didn't do anything wrong." He thought that he noticed Kimiko nodding at that so he continued. "I wanted to talk to you so we can both be sure about your future here, how we can be sure that you are comfortable staying here and how we can help you."<br><br>Kimiko looked up at that, making eye contact despite her best effort not to. "Help me do what?" she asked softly. It was said calmly but there was a lot of force about it.<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "Help you continue on here as you want to."<br><br>Having looked up for the first time, Kimiko noticed the new artwork on the walls with a jolt. She focused on the nearest one. "Did granddad send these?" she asked, standing up to get a better look. Mitch nodded. "That's his style," she added. She got up and walked close to the nearest one. Shot from the back it showed a naked woman — who, Mitch realised, somewhat resembled Kimiko — on her knees with her hands crossed behind her back, and to judge by the submissive look on her face which she had half turned from the camera, she was calmly waiting for her hands to be tied. A decent length of thick rope lay coiled ready at her feet.<br><br>"It's called Kinbaku," Kimiko told Mitch as she knelt near the print, copying the model's pose and gazing over her shoulder at Mitch to see his reaction. "Sometimes it's called Shibari," she added as she crossed her hands behind her back. There was no rope.<br><br>Mitch managed to keep his voice steady. "That's what people keep telling me," Mitch agreed. "You're not going to be tied up here," he added.<br><br>"And if I wanted it?" Kimiko challenged him. "I should be punished!" she demanded forcefully.<br><br>"Kimiko, I'm not going to punish you," Mitch insisted. He stood back from the kneeling mailgirl trying to work out how to get their conversation back on track. In the silence, Kimiko loosened her hands from her pose. She reached down past her firm belly with one hand and underneath her trim bottom with the other one. She began to frig herself vigorously, one hand on her clit, the other inside her lips.<br><br>"Punish me," she insisted as she bent forward to more easily pleasure herself while still on her knees, legs spread and taut.<br><br>"Kimiko," Mitch pleaded. "You know me. That's not the sort of person I am." He took breath before offering his weakest rebuttal. "That doesn't happen here."<br><br>Did she take any notice? Deep in her own thoughts and sensations, Kimiko pumped her hands harder, she could have been there alone in her own imaginings. At that moment, the door to the boardroom opened. Jackson stood there, naked of course with a broad smile on her face, poised and ready to enter. "Am I interrupting anything?" she smirked.<br><br>"Kimiko and I were just having a conversation," Mitch advised.<br><br>"I can see that," Jackson agreed as she closed the door and walked up to Kimiko who had chosen to slide onto her back, her legs wide as she groaned, clearly close to an orgasm.<br><br>"Kimiko, I'm here, I came as you asked me," the former union rep advised, leaning over the wanking mailgirl, her breasts only inches from her face. Kimiko ignored Jackson as she concentrated on pleasuring herself, clearly close to orgasm.<br><br>Jackson shrugged and went over to stand with Mitch. "Nice weather we're having," she joshed with Mitch as the other mailgirl started to grunt then moan and lurch as she appeared to begin to climax.<br><br>"Yes," Mitch agreed, "I might go for a run after work."<br><br>"Haha, I get all the running I need here. In case you weren't aware." Jackson looked over to Kimiko who was thrusting her hips, it seemed in some sort of frustration at not being able to get where she wanted. "Do you need a hand?" Jackson called out to her cheerfully. That seemed to do it, Kimiko erupted into a series of intense spasms. Jackson and Mitch waited patiently for her to finish. When Kimiko looked over from her prone position and smiled at them, Jackson picked up on why she was there. "Where are we up to Mitch?"<br><br>Mitch sighed. "I'd like to say that things can stay the same as they were, but I can't tell you that, Kimiko."<br><br>"Why not?" Kimiko demanded. "I'm my own person. And we have a contract. Surely I have agency. What are my rights, Marjorie?"<br><br>Mitch gave them each a grave look. "It's not my choice. It's what Mr Harada wants."<br><br>Kimiko shook her head. "Granddad wants a lot of things. He doesn't always get them."<br><br>Mitch nodded and looked to Jackson. "I think this is my area," Jackson stated unnecessarily, since the other two clearly knew that. "You want Kimiko to stay with us, right Mitch?" she asked and Mitch immediately nodded. If it was up to him. "And Kimiko is correct," Jackson added, "you cannot actually fire her for anything like this. First of all there's unfair dismissal. So the Fair Work Commission would get involved. But there's also the other thing." She paused. Mitch and Kimiko looked at her for the big reveal. Jackson rolled her eyes. "Mitch, the publicity. If you obey Mr Harada if he tells you to sack Kimiko, say she went to the press. I believe the adverse publicity and the dishonour is something that Mr Harada would prefer to avoid? Family company, family scandal. All of that."<br><br>Mitch thought about that for a moment, nodding as everything Jackson had said seemed to be right. He looked to Kimiko who was starting to play a finger on her clit.<br><br>Jackson noticed too. "Insatiable," she smiled. "I don't know how you do it."<br><br>Mitch smiled at both of the mailgirls. "It looks like Jackson has solved this for us. Let's wait and see what Mr Harada says when I finally do hear from him." He smiled at Jackson. "Thanks, I guess I have answers to whatever he tells me."<br><br>Jackson shrugged like it was no big deal. "I guess you do," she added, as if it was all a matter of Mitch working things out for himself.<br><br>"I think this is the point where I leave," he stated.<br><br>Jackson pulled a long face. "Oh Mitch, do you need to?" And she ran a finger down to her clit. As if she was going have some of what Kimiko was having. Mitch shook his head at her.<br><br>Kimiko looked up from the floor smiling at the boss as she worked both hands on herself, trying for another orgasm. "Mitch, you are the best boss ever," she gasped, shuddering from getting close again.<br><br>But Mitch chose to go despite what was going on in front of him. Well, he thought, there's probably no other boss who has six naked masturbating beauties working for him all day. Maybe he was doing something right.<br><br>He stepped into the hallway and turned to see that Jackson had followed him. She smiled. "Honestly," she laughed, "that girl's always on the verge, always just about to go off."<br><br>Mitch felt bold. "Not your thing?" he tested.<br><br>Jackson grabbed him gently by the shoulder. "Mitch, you know what I want."<br><br>Mitch shook his head trying to me light about it. "Not going to happen."<br><br>Jackson shook her head, smiling, as she held him. She ran her hand down his arm and let go. But she stayed close to Mitch, very close. "One day," she whispered, "one day." And she jogged off, around the corner and out of Mitch's sight.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette Kellerman slunk into Mitch's office. Although she had a confident look on her face, she betrayed her nerves by biting on a pinky as she sidled towards Mitch's desk in a coy way, hiding her crotch from his view. Mitch tried to recall if she had ever been as brazen as Jackson or Kimiko with him as he watched her slowly come towards him. He gestured at one of the chairs in front of his desk.<br><br>"Have I done something wrong?" she asked him, still biting on her finger. He recalled how confident she had acted in the job interview, or what there had been of it given how quickly it was over. She had stripped in front of him and Belinda Clark, had said that she wanted to be a mailgirl and that was pretty much that. Maybe her bravado then was a complete act, a rehearsed way to pass the interview. He would try to find out, not wanting her to be trapped as a mailgirl if she had now found that was not what she wanted to be. "Mitch?" she reminded him. Obviously he had been in his own thoughts for too long.<br><br>"No, you've done nothing wrong. At least not that I know of." Mitch smiled and the naked mailgirl opposite him smiled back with her wide thin lips and brightly dark eyes that hinted at things that he did not know of. "I am hoping to speak to all of you now that we have been doing this for about three months to see how you feel so that I can get an idea of how things can be improved or changed for your comfort."<br><br>Annette leant back in her chair. "Oh, you want me to be comfortable," she teased, opening her legs just a little, resting her hands on the armrest so that she was totally exposed to the manager.<br><br>Mitch glanced at the mailgirl's alluring body. Undressed, she turned out to be the Australian mailgirl who was closest to the American ideal of the fit, perfect hardbodied mailgirl that their videos promoted. Realising that he was ogling her body, Mitch made the effort to look her in the eyes. "Do you have any doubts? Any feelings of regret about choosing this? Or are you totally happy with the way that things are going?"<br><br>Annette Kellerman sat up straight, crossing her legs and folding her arms around each other almost in embarrassment as she thought about an answer to that. Had he put her in interview mode again? "I guess if you had told me a year ago that every day I come to work, the first thing I would do is take my clothes off. Well! I don't know what I would say to my one year ago self about that. But regrets..." She thought for a moment. "I was kind of expecting to get punished."<br><br>Mitch looked concerned. "That's not going to happen. But why, what for?"<br><br>Annette relaxed a bit. "Because it would be kind of hot. Isn't that what you are supposed to do to mailgirls?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "You'll need to go to the States or Japan to get that. Have you forgotten your contract?"<br><br>Annette smiled. "I didn't read the contract. I mean who does? I know what you told us, but I thought that was just words to trap us in or something. I thought it would be like the videos, I guess." She hooked a finger in her mouth to think for a moment. "So you cannot punish me?" She squirmed in her seat as if she knew the answer was yes but still hoping that it was no.<br><br>Mitch shook his head again. "I am not allowed to under your work conditions. And anyway, you have done nothing I can punish you for."<br><br>Annette perked right up. "I'm sure I can think of something." She looked around the room.<br><br>"I know you're joking." Mitch looked at Annette, but he was not so sure that she was joking to judge by the hope in her posture. "Anyway," he continued, "that's not going to happen. I am just not going to do that to my employees."<br><br>Annette pouted. But what was a girl to do?<br><br>Mitch sighed. "I know it's weird. We're paying you a lot of money to not wear any clothes and to do a few things around the place that are not too difficult. One thing I don't know about you, one thing it would be useful to know is whether you have any career plans."<br><br>Annette thought for a moment. "Not really. I didn't mind what I was doing here before. But I don't miss it."<br><br>"Have you kept in touch with your old department? Where you were the PA?"<br><br>"Not really. They haven't paged me yet and I've had no reason to go there."<br><br>"So you don't think about what you would do post-mailgirl?"<br><br>"Should I?" Annette looked worried. "Is there something? Are you telling me?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Nothing like that. It's good that some of you are keeping up your skills and studying. How are you still finding the economics course?"<br><br>"Just in case?"<br><br>"Just in case."<br><br>Annette thought for a moment. "The economics course is a bit, well, dry. But the BAD boys downstairs said that if I wanted they would find me work there. They would train me up."<br><br>Mitch looked concerned.<br><br>Annette shook her head. "Oh I know." She squeezed her breasts at Mitch. "I'm sure that it has something to do with the naked part of the job. But there wasn't just helping with the prints in the boardroom. I've done a few other things down there, helped them with some assembling and stuff. So they know I'm good with my hands."<br><br>Mitch smiled.<br><br>Annette gave him a theatrical sigh. "No, not just doing that," she asserted.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was serving up dinner for all four of the family.<br><br>Emily looked at hers. "Impressive, dad."<br><br>Cara looked at hers. "Not out of a box, dad?" she asked.<br><br>"No, Cara. I should be offended. You know I can cook."<br><br>"But you've been so busy at work, dad," she continued. Then she smiled. "How was your day in the office?"<br><br>"How was Uni?" he asked back. But his daughters were not going to be deflected.<br><br>"Yeah," Emily added, "how were all those naked mailgirls? Were they bothering you?"<br><br>Jessica glared at both the girls. But this level of taunting was not unusual, so the girls brushed that off.<br><br>"Well," Mitch smiled, deciding to play up to them. "One of them decided that she needed to be punished."<br><br>"Wow," Emily exclaimed, "did you do it?"<br><br>Mitch looked appalled at the thought. "No, of course not. First of all, that's not how I treat my employees and, well, it's just wrong."<br><br>Emily wasn't satisfied with that. "But she's a mailgirl in your company and she must expect to get disciplined. That's part of being a mailgirl."<br><br>"Not with us. We don't have anyone in the office who would discipline our mailgirls. We don't hire people like that," Mitch said, trying to be light about it, but he suspected that he had not completely succeeded.<br><br>Jessica shot Mitch a look that if the girls had seen, they would not have understood. "Not in front of the girls, Mitch," she warned.<br><br>Mitch stirred his dinner. "I think they're old enough."<br><br>Cara spoke up. "I'll do it!" Emily gave her a wide-eyed look. One that their parents did not read. One that they would not have understood.<br><br>Jessica turned to Mitch. "That's why not in front of the girls. You have one daughter who wants to be a mailgirl and now the other one wants to beat them up."<br><br>Both girls smiled angelically at their mother. Mitch smiled when he noticed.<br><br>Jessica shook her head. "I give up."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mr Harada was on the Skype with Mitch. He had finally made contact for the first time since his visit, and it was not going well for Mitch. "Do you even read the reports from Tokyo and New York?" Mr Harada harangued him. Mr Harada did not wait for an answer. They both knew what the answer to that was. Mr Harada looked sternly into his camera. "Your report is due on the fifth," he stressed slowly. "I suggest you read the reports from the others so you see what we expect from you." There was no emotion in the older man's voice, not even a hint of weariness or the strain of having to deal with his troublesome Australian boss. And not a flicker of a hint of how he felt about the issue at the root of the fracture. Kimiko. Mr Harada stared for a moment longer with Mitch wondering if the Skype image had frozen. But no, the smallest gesture of dismissal came from Mr Harada and the call was over.<br><br>Mitch sat back for a moment to find his equilibrium. When he had calmed he took a look through the recent reports as Mr Harada had suggested and after thinking for a moment, he got onto the app and paged Jan Stephenson since he had spoken to her for a while. She appeared after only a few moments, jogging past Betty Cuthbert before the PA could react and came straight into Mitch's office with a wide grin.<br><br>"This is a rare privilege, Mr Johnson," she grinned, as she sashayed towards Mitch. "You want?" she asked hopefully.<br><br>Mitch seemed to missread her performance as he smiled at her. "I want Wendy," he stated flatly. "Can you find her? Ask her to come in here. It's rather urgent." He finished and looked at Jan who had not moved. She had her hands on her hips, poised like there was something that Mitch had forgotten. He looked at her and woke up. "Sorry Jan, I have something urgent on my mind. I hope that didn't sound too dismissive?"<br><br>Jan shook her head, showing that she understood. "Is there anything else that you need?" she asked, still trying to give some cheer to her clearly troubled boss.<br><br>"Sorry," he replied. "It's not you and I know you're trying to help. Can you please find Wendy to help me sort something out."<br><br>"It's not something that we've done?" Jan asked, worried as she stepped up to put her hands on his desk, to look down to Mitch with concern.<br><br>"No, nothing like that at all. I just need Wendy to help me with some reports." He paused and looked up to the face of the tall, athletic nude who towered over him. "Sorry," he apologised. "I've been meaning to catch up with you, have a chat to see how things have been going. When I've got a moment..." Mitch gestured at all the stuff on his desk that was taking up his time.<br><br>Jan smiled reassuringly. "I understand. I'll go and find Wendy." And she jogged out, as Mitch sat hopeful that he was not alienating his staff with his own issues.<br><br>Wendy came in not long after, bustling and blousy but exuding an air of control. Mitch explained the problem to her and showed her the report from the States and let her read through it. Wendy Turnbull did not seem perturbed or flustered as she scrolled down. Was this because she knew it was his problem, not hers, Mitch wondered. After she seemed to have absorbed this gist of the report, Mitch spoke up.<br><br>Can you assemble the data by the third?" he asked her.<br><br>"Already on it," she smiled. "I've got most of it done."<br><br>Mitch was taken aback. "Oh, how come?" he questioned her. He tried to look impressed with the shapely woman who was the mailgirls' supervisor.<br><br>Wendy laughed a little. "Betty Cuthbert forwarded the emails to me. I have had them for a few weeks now." Wendy sat back, serene. "You do know that you are meant to comment on the Tokyo and New York reports? I didn't see any comments from you on last month's."<br><br>"An oversight," Mitch laughed.<br><br>Wendy went along with that. "Well, I have a good part of the report drafted. The rest of the data is on the app. I just have to download it and organise it to make it readable. You should have a look at those reports," she added. "Lindsay Davenport has added some comments to the American report. I think she's gone out of her way to be critical to you. She's your equivalent in the US operation, right?"<br><br>"Well, if you call running an operation twenty times bigger than mine, yes, she's my equivalent. Although she's a vice president, I think."<br><br>"Funny then that she seems to be taking an interest in the Australian operation then. Sounds like she should be busy enough with her own. Anyway, have a look at what she said. I'll highlight the passages and email it to you," Wendy advised, efficient as usual.<br><br>"What would I do without you?" Mitch wondered aloud.<br><br>Wendy smiled. "You would have to check on the girls every morning yourself." She paused. "Just joking. But we will have to work out who should cover for me if I take any time off." Mitch looked worried. Wendy read his concerned look and explained. "I'm planning some holidays," she explained. "Don't worry, it's not for a little while. But did you know that we have fewer absences than the New York office?" she added, feeling confident to show her range.<br><br>Mitch strode up to Kimiko so that she could not but know that he was standing right close to her.<br><br>"Thank you for coming," he started. He looked down at her imagining her in one of the pictures that Mr Harada had sent, which loomed over him as he tried to connect with the submissive mailgirl. Why had he chosen this place for such a discussion with her? Once again he had to work hard to concentrate on the person in front of him and put a vision of her bound and helpless out of his mind.<br><br>"I did not have a choice, did I?" she replied. She was not going to make this easy, he realised.<br><br>"Kimiko," he stated gently, "you could have taken the day off."<br><br>Kimiko maintained her pose on her knees. And her defensive attitude. "I didn't have a reason."<br><br>Mitch sought to lay on the kindly approach. "I don't want to tell you off. For a start, there is nothing to tell you off about as you didn't do anything wrong." He thought that he noticed Kimiko nodding at that so he continued. "I wanted to talk to you so we can both be sure about your future here, how we can be sure that you are comfortable staying here and how we can help you."<br><br>Kimiko looked up at that, making eye contact despite her best effort not to. "Help me do what?" she asked softly. It was said calmly but there was a lot of force about it.<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "Help you continue on here as you want to."<br><br>Having looked up for the first time, Kimiko noticed the new artwork on the walls with a jolt. She focused on the nearest one. "Did granddad send these?" she asked, standing up to get a better look. Mitch nodded. "That's his style," she added. She got up and walked close to the nearest one. Shot from the back it showed a naked woman — who, Mitch realised, somewhat resembled Kimiko — on her knees with her hands crossed behind her back, and to judge by the submissive look on her face which she had half turned from the camera, she was calmly waiting for her hands to be tied. A decent length of thick rope lay coiled ready at her feet.<br><br>"It's called Kinbaku," Kimiko told Mitch as she knelt near the print, copying the model's pose and gazing over her shoulder at Mitch to see his reaction. "Sometimes it's called Shibari," she added as she crossed her hands behind her back. There was no rope.<br><br>Mitch managed to keep his voice steady. "That's what people keep telling me," Mitch agreed. "You're not going to be tied up here," he added.<br><br>"And if I wanted it?" Kimiko challenged him. "I should be punished!" she demanded forcefully.<br><br>"Kimiko, I'm not going to punish you," Mitch insisted. He stood back from the kneeling mailgirl trying to work out how to get their conversation back on track. In the silence, Kimiko loosened her hands from her pose. She reached down past her firm belly with one hand and underneath her trim bottom with the other one. She began to frig herself vigorously, one hand on her clit, the other inside her lips.<br><br>"Punish me," she insisted as she bent forward to more easily pleasure herself while still on her knees, legs spread and taut.<br><br>"Kimiko," Mitch pleaded. "You know me. That's not the sort of person I am." He took breath before offering his weakest rebuttal. "That doesn't happen here."<br><br>Did she take any notice? Deep in her own thoughts and sensations, Kimiko pumped her hands harder, she could have been there alone in her own imaginings. At that moment, the door to the boardroom opened. Jackson stood there, naked of course with a broad smile on her face, poised and ready to enter. "Am I interrupting anything?" she smirked.<br><br>"Kimiko and I were just having a conversation," Mitch advised.<br><br>"I can see that," Jackson agreed as she closed the door and walked up to Kimiko who had chosen to slide onto her back, her legs wide as she groaned, clearly close to an orgasm.<br><br>"Kimiko, I'm here, I came as you asked me," the former union rep advised, leaning over the wanking mailgirl, her breasts only inches from her face. Kimiko ignored Jackson as she concentrated on pleasuring herself, clearly close to orgasm.<br><br>Jackson shrugged and went over to stand with Mitch. "Nice weather we're having," she joshed with Mitch as the other mailgirl started to grunt then moan and lurch as she appeared to begin to climax.<br><br>"Yes," Mitch agreed, "I might go for a run after work."<br><br>"Haha, I get all the running I need here. In case you weren't aware." Jackson looked over to Kimiko who was thrusting her hips, it seemed in some sort of frustration at not being able to get where she wanted. "Do you need a hand?" Jackson called out to her cheerfully. That seemed to do it, Kimiko erupted into a series of intense spasms. Jackson and Mitch waited patiently for her to finish. When Kimiko looked over from her prone position and smiled at them, Jackson picked up on why she was there. "Where are we up to Mitch?"<br><br>Mitch sighed. "I'd like to say that things can stay the same as they were, but I can't tell you that, Kimiko."<br><br>"Why not?" Kimiko demanded. "I'm my own person. And we have a contract. Surely I have agency. What are my rights, Marjorie?"<br><br>Mitch gave them each a grave look. "It's not my choice. It's what Mr Harada wants."<br><br>Kimiko shook her head. "Granddad wants a lot of things. He doesn't always get them."<br><br>Mitch nodded and looked to Jackson. "I think this is my area," Jackson stated unnecessarily, since the other two clearly knew that. "You want Kimiko to stay with us, right Mitch?" she asked and Mitch immediately nodded. If it was up to him. "And Kimiko is correct," Jackson added, "you cannot actually fire her for anything like this. First of all there's unfair dismissal. So the Fair Work Commission would get involved. But there's also the other thing." She paused. Mitch and Kimiko looked at her for the big reveal. Jackson rolled her eyes. "Mitch, the publicity. If you obey Mr Harada if he tells you to sack Kimiko, say she went to the press. I believe the adverse publicity and the dishonour is something that Mr Harada would prefer to avoid? Family company, family scandal. All of that."<br><br>Mitch thought about that for a moment, nodding as everything Jackson had said seemed to be right. He looked to Kimiko who was starting to play a finger on her clit.<br><br>Jackson noticed too. "Insatiable," she smiled. "I don't know how you do it."<br><br>Mitch smiled at both of the mailgirls. "It looks like Jackson has solved this for us. Let's wait and see what Mr Harada says when I finally do hear from him." He smiled at Jackson. "Thanks, I guess I have answers to whatever he tells me."<br><br>Jackson shrugged like it was no big deal. "I guess you do," she added, as if it was all a matter of Mitch working things out for himself.<br><br>"I think this is the point where I leave," he stated.<br><br>Jackson pulled a long face. "Oh Mitch, do you need to?" And she ran a finger down to her clit. As if she was going have some of what Kimiko was having. Mitch shook his head at her.<br><br>Kimiko looked up from the floor smiling at the boss as she worked both hands on herself, trying for another orgasm. "Mitch, you are the best boss ever," she gasped, shuddering from getting close again.<br><br>But Mitch chose to go despite what was going on in front of him. Well, he thought, there's probably no other boss who has six naked masturbating beauties working for him all day. Maybe he was doing something right.<br><br>He stepped into the hallway and turned to see that Jackson had followed him. She smiled. "Honestly," she laughed, "that girl's always on the verge, always just about to go off."<br><br>Mitch felt bold. "Not your thing?" he tested.<br><br>Jackson grabbed him gently by the shoulder. "Mitch, you know what I want."<br><br>Mitch shook his head trying to me light about it. "Not going to happen."<br><br>Jackson shook her head, smiling, as she held him. She ran her hand down his arm and let go. But she stayed close to Mitch, very close. "One day," she whispered, "one day." And she jogged off, around the corner and out of Mitch's sight.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette Kellerman slunk into Mitch's office. Although she had a confident look on her face, she betrayed her nerves by biting on a pinky as she sidled towards Mitch's desk in a coy way, hiding her crotch from his view. Mitch tried to recall if she had ever been as brazen as Jackson or Kimiko with him as he watched her slowly come towards him. He gestured at one of the chairs in front of his desk.<br><br>"Have I done something wrong?" she asked him, still biting on her finger. He recalled how confident she had acted in the job interview, or what there had been of it given how quickly it was over. She had stripped in front of him and Belinda Clark, had said that she wanted to be a mailgirl and that was pretty much that. Maybe her bravado then was a complete act, a rehearsed way to pass the interview. He would try to find out, not wanting her to be trapped as a mailgirl if she had now found that was not what she wanted to be. "Mitch?" she reminded him. Obviously he had been in his own thoughts for too long.<br><br>"No, you've done nothing wrong. At least not that I know of." Mitch smiled and the naked mailgirl opposite him smiled back with her wide thin lips and brightly dark eyes that hinted at things that he did not know of. "I am hoping to speak to all of you now that we have been doing this for about three months to see how you feel so that I can get an idea of how things can be improved or changed for your comfort."<br><br>Annette leant back in her chair. "Oh, you want me to be comfortable," she teased, opening her legs just a little, resting her hands on the armrest so that she was totally exposed to the manager.<br><br>Mitch glanced at the mailgirl's alluring body. Undressed, she turned out to be the Australian mailgirl who was closest to the American ideal of the fit, perfect hardbodied mailgirl that their videos promoted. Realising that he was ogling her body, Mitch made the effort to look her in the eyes. "Do you have any doubts? Any feelings of regret about choosing this? Or are you totally happy with the way that things are going?"<br><br>Annette Kellerman sat up straight, crossing her legs and folding her arms around each other almost in embarrassment as she thought about an answer to that. Had he put her in interview mode again? "I guess if you had told me a year ago that every day I come to work, the first thing I would do is take my clothes off. Well! I don't know what I would say to my one year ago self about that. But regrets..." She thought for a moment. "I was kind of expecting to get punished."<br><br>Mitch looked concerned. "That's not going to happen. But why, what for?"<br><br>Annette relaxed a bit. "Because it would be kind of hot. Isn't that what you are supposed to do to mailgirls?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "You'll need to go to the States or Japan to get that. Have you forgotten your contract?"<br><br>Annette smiled. "I didn't read the contract. I mean who does? I know what you told us, but I thought that was just words to trap us in or something. I thought it would be like the videos, I guess." She hooked a finger in her mouth to think for a moment. "So you cannot punish me?" She squirmed in her seat as if she knew the answer was yes but still hoping that it was no.<br><br>Mitch shook his head again. "I am not allowed to under your work conditions. And anyway, you have done nothing I can punish you for."<br><br>Annette perked right up. "I'm sure I can think of something." She looked around the room.<br><br>"I know you're joking." Mitch looked at Annette, but he was not so sure that she was joking to judge by the hope in her posture. "Anyway," he continued, "that's not going to happen. I am just not going to do that to my employees."<br><br>Annette pouted. But what was a girl to do?<br><br>Mitch sighed. "I know it's weird. We're paying you a lot of money to not wear any clothes and to do a few things around the place that are not too difficult. One thing I don't know about you, one thing it would be useful to know is whether you have any career plans."<br><br>Annette thought for a moment. "Not really. I didn't mind what I was doing here before. But I don't miss it."<br><br>"Have you kept in touch with your old department? Where you were the PA?"<br><br>"Not really. They haven't paged me yet and I've had no reason to go there."<br><br>"So you don't think about what you would do post-mailgirl?"<br><br>"Should I?" Annette looked worried. "Is there something? Are you telling me?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Nothing like that. It's good that some of you are keeping up your skills and studying. How are you still finding the economics course?"<br><br>"Just in case?"<br><br>"Just in case."<br><br>Annette thought for a moment. "The economics course is a bit, well, dry. But the BAD boys downstairs said that if I wanted they would find me work there. They would train me up."<br><br>Mitch looked concerned.<br><br>Annette shook her head. "Oh I know." She squeezed her breasts at Mitch. "I'm sure that it has something to do with the naked part of the job. But there wasn't just helping with the prints in the boardroom. I've done a few other things down there, helped them with some assembling and stuff. So they know I'm good with my hands."<br><br>Mitch smiled.<br><br>Annette gave him a theatrical sigh. "No, not just doing that," she asserted.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was serving up dinner for all four of the family.<br><br>Emily looked at hers. "Impressive, dad."<br><br>Cara looked at hers. "Not out of a box, dad?" she asked.<br><br>"No, Cara. I should be offended. You know I can cook."<br><br>"But you've been so busy at work, dad," she continued. Then she smiled. "How was your day in the office?"<br><br>"How was Uni?" he asked back. But his daughters were not going to be deflected.<br><br>"Yeah," Emily added, "how were all those naked mailgirls? Were they bothering you?"<br><br>Jessica glared at both the girls. But this level of taunting was not unusual, so the girls brushed that off.<br><br>"Well," Mitch smiled, deciding to play up to them. "One of them decided that she needed to be punished."<br><br>"Wow," Emily exclaimed, "did you do it?"<br><br>Mitch looked appalled at the thought. "No, of course not. First of all, that's not how I treat my employees and, well, it's just wrong."<br><br>Emily wasn't satisfied with that. "But she's a mailgirl in your company and she must expect to get disciplined. That's part of being a mailgirl."<br><br>"Not with us. We don't have anyone in the office who would discipline our mailgirls. We don't hire people like that," Mitch said, trying to be light about it, but he suspected that he had not completely succeeded.<br><br>Jessica shot Mitch a look that if the girls had seen, they would not have understood. "Not in front of the girls, Mitch," she warned.<br><br>Mitch stirred his dinner. "I think they're old enough."<br><br>Cara spoke up. "I'll do it!" Emily gave her a wide-eyed look. One that their parents did not read. One that they would not have understood.<br><br>Jessica turned to Mitch. "That's why not in front of the girls. You have one daughter who wants to be a mailgirl and now the other one wants to beat them up."<br><br>Both girls smiled angelically at their mother. Mitch smiled when he noticed.<br><br>Jessica shook her head. "I give up."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mr Harada was on the Skype with Mitch. He had finally made contact for the first time since his visit, and it was not going well for Mitch. "Do you even read the reports from Tokyo and New York?" Mr Harada harangued him. Mr Harada did not wait for an answer. They both knew what the answer to that was. Mr Harada looked sternly into his camera. "Your report is due on the fifth," he stressed slowly. "I suggest you read the reports from the others so you see what we expect from you." There was no emotion in the older man's voice, not even a hint of weariness or the strain of having to deal with his troublesome Australian boss. And not a flicker of a hint of how he felt about the issue at the root of the fracture. Kimiko. Mr Harada stared for a moment longer with Mitch wondering if the Skype image had frozen. But no, the smallest gesture of dismissal came from Mr Harada and the call was over.<br><br>Mitch sat back for a moment to find his equilibrium. When he had calmed he took a look through the recent reports as Mr Harada had suggested and after thinking for a moment, he got onto the app and paged Jan Stephenson since he had spoken to her for a while. She appeared after only a few moments, jogging past Betty Cuthbert before the PA could react and came straight into Mitch's office with a wide grin.<br><br>"This is a rare privilege, Mr Johnson," she grinned, as she sashayed towards Mitch. "You want?" she asked hopefully.<br><br>Mitch seemed to missread her performance as he smiled at her. "I want Wendy," he stated flatly. "Can you find her? Ask her to come in here. It's rather urgent." He finished and looked at Jan who had not moved. She had her hands on her hips, poised like there was something that Mitch had forgotten. He looked at her and woke up. "Sorry Jan, I have something urgent on my mind. I hope that didn't sound too dismissive?"<br><br>Jan shook her head, showing that she understood. "Is there anything else that you need?" she asked, still trying to give some cheer to her clearly troubled boss.<br><br>"Sorry," he replied. "It's not you and I know you're trying to help. Can you please find Wendy to help me sort something out."<br><br>"It's not something that we've done?" Jan asked, worried as she stepped up to put her hands on his desk, to look down to Mitch with concern.<br><br>"No, nothing like that at all. I just need Wendy to help me with some reports." He paused and looked up to the face of the tall, athletic nude who towered over him. "Sorry," he apologised. "I've been meaning to catch up with you, have a chat to see how things have been going. When I've got a moment..." Mitch gestured at all the stuff on his desk that was taking up his time.<br><br>Jan smiled reassuringly. "I understand. I'll go and find Wendy." And she jogged out, as Mitch sat hopeful that he was not alienating his staff with his own issues.<br><br>Wendy came in not long after, bustling and blousy but exuding an air of control. Mitch explained the problem to her and showed her the report from the States and let her read through it. Wendy Turnbull did not seem perturbed or flustered as she scrolled down. Was this because she knew it was his problem, not hers, Mitch wondered. After she seemed to have absorbed this gist of the report, Mitch spoke up.<br><br>Can you assemble the data by the third?" he asked her.<br><br>"Already on it," she smiled. "I've got most of it done."<br><br>Mitch was taken aback. "Oh, how come?" he questioned her. He tried to look impressed with the shapely woman who was the mailgirls' supervisor.<br><br>Wendy laughed a little. "Betty Cuthbert forwarded the emails to me. I have had them for a few weeks now." Wendy sat back, serene. "You do know that you are meant to comment on the Tokyo and New York reports? I didn't see any comments from you on last month's."<br><br>"An oversight," Mitch laughed.<br><br>Wendy went along with that. "Well, I have a good part of the report drafted. The rest of the data is on the app. I just have to download it and organise it to make it readable. You should have a look at those reports," she added. "Lindsay Davenport has added some comments to the American report. I think she's gone out of her way to be critical to you. She's your equivalent in the US operation, right?"<br><br>"Well, if you call running an operation twenty times bigger than mine, yes, she's my equivalent. Although she's a vice president, I think."<br><br>"Funny then that she seems to be taking an interest in the Australian operation then. Sounds like she should be busy enough with her own. Anyway, have a look at what she said. I'll highlight the passages and email it to you," Wendy advised, efficient as usual.<br><br>"What would I do without you?" Mitch wondered aloud.<br><br>Wendy smiled. "You would have to check on the girls every morning yourself." She paused. "Just joking. But we will have to work out who should cover for me if I take any time off." Mitch looked worried. Wendy read his concerned look and explained. "I'm planning some holidays," she explained. "Don't worry, it's not for a little while. But did you know that we have fewer absences than the New York office?" she added, feeling confident to show her range.<br><br>Emily grimaced at her sister. Cara slapped the ruler against each of her calves again. And then her buttocks.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The week rolled on. Returning to his office from a mid-morning meeting, a sixth sense warned Mitch to stop before he turned the corner. He waited for a moment then looked around the corner from his position, mostly hidden from Betty Cuthbert's desk. Jackson was on her knees in front of Betty who was seated. The naked mailgirl held both of Betty's hands in hers and they were deep in conversation, obviously very private. Mitch wondered at the incongruity of Betty for once dealing with a mailgirl on equal terms and knew that he was not going to intrude on such an unusual event.<br><br>To his surprise, Jackson stood up, still holding Betty's hands in a way that forced her to stand too. Jackson drew her close giving his normally reticent PA a strong hug which Betty seemed to happily accept. Mitch noted pruriently how Jackson's naked breasts were pressed tight against Betty's blouse. He chose to leave the scene to give them the privacy for whatever was going on between them. He backed off towards the lifts, deciding to head out for a moment and get some fresh air.<br><br>Mitch returned about fifteen minutes later to find Betty Cuthbert sitting alone at her desk, seemingly engrossed in her work, giving no suggestion that anything was different to her usual haughtiness.<br><br>"All good?" he asked her as he reached the door to his office.<br><br>"All good," she replied flatly without raising her eyes from her work.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch tried to keep the encounter between Jackson and Betty Cuthbert to the back of his mind as the day proceeded, but he knew that his curiosity would win and he would have to ask Jackson about it at some point before the end of the day. It was an occurrence so strange that he needed to know. The image stayed in his mind, the naked mailgirl hugging his usually touch averse and mailgirl averse PA. Mitch tried to convince himself that his urge for an explanation was his concern for Betty's well-being. Nothing about being intrusive. No, nothing.<br><br>Trying, Mitch could conjure no reason to summon a mailgirl during the afternoon even though he was aware that as the head of the office he could call any mailgirl he chose without needing a reason. At three o'clock, he gave in and used his admin rights to request Jackson.<br><br>She sauntered in to his office about fifteen minutes later. Mitch noted that Betty pretended to not notice her as the naked woman sauntered past, as usual walking as close to Betty's desk as possible, swishing her hips teasing close to Betty's near elbow. Were both of them playing these parts for his benefit? And why had Jackson taken so long to respond. In an office with demerits, that would have meant a public punishment at the end of the week. But, as Mitch was happy to recall, Melbourne was different.<br><br>Not that Jackson seemed fussed by her tardiness. She looked strong and attractive as she strode up to Mitch's desk and leaned over it with her breasts gently jingling in his face. "I'm guessing that there isn't a message to deliver?" she challenged.<br><br>Mitch smiled and shook his head. "Close the door," he asked her gently.<br><br>"Oh good," she responded and sashayed back to the door, making sure that Mitch enjoyed the sight of her body.<br><br>"So you are finally giving in to me?" she asked when she was again leaning over the desk as the smiling manager shook his head. "So?" she asked, "how else may I help?"<br><br>Mitch sighed and shook his head with exaggerated sadface. "I saw you and Betty in the morning. I was wondering..."<br><br>Noting his hesitancy, Jackson straightened up and interrupted. "Oh that." She smiled possessively down at him. "You were wondering what was going on?" Mitch nodded, holding eye contact. "It's going to cost you," Jackson warned.<br><br>Mitch stared at her for a moment. "What?" he asked eventually.<br><br>"Now, let's see," Jackson said giving Mitch the impression that she was considering how far she would push him. Having made up her mind, she looked him in the eyes. "Tell me how much you like my arse."<br><br>Jackson stepped back from the desk, turned around once and then took a few steps away so that Mitch could fully appreciate her round but firm butt cheeks and the crease that ran down between them. She bent forward just enough to give Mitch a glimpse of her butthole before straightening up and marching back to the desk. She pulled one of the seats facing Mitch back enough that she could sit down while spreading her legs enough for Mitch to be able to clearly see her lightly working her clit with one hand.<br><br>"Your arse is magnificent," Mitch pronounced because it clearly was.<br><br>Jackson lowered a finger into her slit and gasped at that before returning to her gentle rubbing. "This space so needs a dildo station," she gasped.<br><br>"That's not going to happen," Mitch reminded her with a gesture to the hard-working PA who was just visible to Mitch outside his door. "You know that."<br><br>Jackson stopped her fingering and crossed her legs. "If you were more observant, you would have noticed that Betty is not herself today."<br><br>Mitch considered that during the day Betty Cuthbert's haughtiness was dialled up only to its usual level, and she was as efficient as usual. The only difference had been the episode with Jackson. "Sorry, but she seems to me like most other days." Mitch looked unconvinced.<br><br>Jackson shook her head slowly, acknowledging the lack of male empathy on display. "I noticed something was up and asked her. It took a little persuasion but eventually she did confide in me. She needs some care today, she's a bit fragile. Her cat's at the vet. She's waiting to hear the news but she's fearing the worst."<br><br>Mitch looked genuinely concerned. "What should I do? I wouldn't have known anything was up if I hadn't stumbled on her, um, with you. I don't think I want her to realise that I know about that."<br><br>"Ah men," Jackson sighed. "Let me try to help you. I assume that there was nothing else you needed to ask me about?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. Jackson nodded back and got up, leaving the office without any further ceremony. She stopped at Betty's desk and called Betty to stop her work so that they could talk. Jackson strode around to the other side of Betty's desk and as she had done before she took Betty by the hands and gave her a brief hug, although this time not as strong as before.<br><br>After Jackson had left, Mitch stepped out of his office and stood by his PA's desk until she noticed him and stopped the work that she had returned to.<br><br>Mitch looked down at her with, he hoped, the right amount of sympathy that he could offer to her. "Betty," he asked softly, "is there anything I can do?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lauryn came into Mitch's office as he finished his morning coffee. She waited a moment to catch his attention and when that did not happen she coughed to get him. Mitch looked up at her. The mailgirl stepped towards his desk. "Shane wants to make sure you open the email from Mr Harada. One sent at eight-fifty this morning."<br><br>Mitch started to scroll down and stopped to regard Lauryn who had one hand on his desk and was swinging one leg then the other through more than 180 degrees as if she was limbering up for her next assignment. "You're not doing any BA work at the moment?" he asked her warmly.<br><br>Lauryn relaxed. "There's none for me at the moment. We finished that latest report on Friday, but you probably know that. So I get to play at being a mailgirl for a while."<br><br>"I'll make sure you're in the contributors list. And how are you finding it, being a mailgirl?"<br><br>"Not as many people stare as I thought they would."<br><br>Mitch stared at the fit, tanned lithe woman in front of him and found that hard to believe. "Maybe you just don't notice them?"<br><br>Lauryn did not flinch or appear troubled by Mitch's stare. "That's possible." She shrugged like it was no big thing to her. She stretched her arms behind her back as a continuation of her limbering up routine with the obvious results of prominently thrusting her breasts forward. Mitch marvelled at how easy all the mailgirls seemed to find being naked in the same office where they had recently been clothed. He looked over Lauryn with a whiff of time past. If only this was years ago and he was not manager of the office and married with a wife and two daughters. He studied her face. Lauryn was staring at him with a smile that recognised that he was objectifying her and that she did not mind. "There's one more thing," she told Mitch.<br><br>"Um, yes," he asked as he returned to the reality of the office.<br><br>"Shane said for me to wait until you had read Mr Harada's email. He did not say why."<br><br>Mitch nodded, back into the office reality. "I better read it then." He scrolled down his emails as he gestured for Lauryn to sit at the desk while she was waiting. She did so and almost instinctively she placed one heel on the edge of Mitch's desk giving him a full view of her crotch. Which of course drew his attention. Lauryn absently scratched a nipple and when she was happy having scratch that itch, she began to languidly finger her clit in Mitch's full view.<br><br>"If only..." she started.<br><br>Mitch finished the thought for her. "There's not going to be a dildo station in here," he concluded for her with a smile. He clicked back to his task. "Right, the email." Mitch read it for a moment, then concentrated further on it. He leaned back in his seat and watched Lauryn gently wank herself for a short while. She had a mild orgasm, a shudder through her body and then she brought herself down and gave Mitch her attention. "I can see why Shane wanted you to wait." Mitch looked mildly concerned.<br><br>"What is it?" Lauryn asked, dropping her leg down to the floor so she could properly pay attention to Mitch.<br><br>"Mr Harada is sending Mrs Ogawa to visit," Mitch told Lauryn who looked blank at that.<br><br>"That's not good?" Lauryn asked.<br><br>At that moment, Shane burst in. "Mrs Ogawa is coming!" he exclaimed at Mitch. Then he noticed Lauryn. "Oh hi, Lauryn," he told her. "He told you?"<br><br>"I just wanked myself to an orgasm," Lauryn told Shane.<br><br>He stood over her with a smile. "What a shame I missed it," he answered. "How about another one?"<br><br>"Later," she laughed, "next time." Then more seriously, "who is Mrs Ogawa?"<br><br>Shane looked to Mitch. He was curious as to how Mitch would handle that news.<br><br>"You know those Japanese correction videos?" he asked Lauryn.<br><br>"You mean the punishment videos?" she asked.<br><br>"That's Mrs Ogawa," Mitch stated. "Doing the punishment. And she's coming here."<br><br>"I'm going to guess," Shane continued, "that it's got something to do with Kimiko." Mitch nodded automatically at that, Shane was most likely right.<br><br>"Oh," Lauryn said. All three looked concerned. They realised that things were about to change.`

                    content: `Mrs Ogawa had arrived from Japan. She sat assertive and stiff in a chair next to Betty Cuthbert's desk, her luggage, two elegant suitcases, standing next to her. Mitchell Johnson came in and saw her.<br><br>"Sorry, I wasn't expecting you this early," he blurted, "how are you?" Projecting her aura as Mr Harada's enforcer, Mrs Ogawa smiled back at Mitch, maintaining the dignity she had assumed while she had been kept out there waiting. Catching Betty Cuthbert's eye, Mitch nodded at the visitor and continued to his office with, as he expected, Betty right behind him. She closed the door and before he could sit she walked up to him. "I wasn't expecting her so soon," the director of the office complained to his PA.<br><br>"I know," Betty Cuthbert replied, "and there's a problem." Mitch gave her a questioning look, so Betty Cuthbert continued. "She doesn't speak English. Or at least she won't speak English to me. In case you didn't notice." Mitch realised that Mrs Ogawa's nod to him could have meant anything.<br><br>"Great," Mitch responded while considering all the issues that created. "Who in the office does speak Japanese?"<br><br>Betty shook her head at Mitch's apparent unknowing. "There's only one person here who I know of." She did not have to name who that was. It was pretty obvious.<br><br>"This creates even more problems," Mitch hissed at Betty.<br><br>Betty looked hard at him. "Do you have any other solution?"<br><br>Mitch thought for a moment. Then decided what to do. He scrolled down his app and summoned Jackson since she was free. Jackson, the mailgirl who knew the most about their rights, was up the stairs in a few moments. She slinked into the area, unselfconsciously naked, and nodded at Betty Cuthbert as she strolled past her desk, looked for a moment at the still Mrs Ogawa who had not apparently moved since Mitch had come in. Jackson noted Mrs Ogawa's chic clothing and stiff manner but managed not to show any reaction to the strangely familiar women as she headed for Mitch's door.<br><br>"Who's she?" she asked Mitch when she was safely inside, facing Mitch across his desk and distracted enough not to play any of her usual games with him, not flaunting the obvious fact that, as usual, she was nude. She was after all a mailgirl. Still, her nipples were erect and pointing at her boss.<br><br>Mitch smiled dangerously. "You didn't recognise her?"<br><br>Jackson's eyes widened with the realisation. "You're kidding? You didn't tell us she would be here today."<br><br>"Well, I wasn't expecting her so soon. But she's here. Can you do me a favour?" Mitch smiled. "Well, it's actually your job. Can you take a message to Shane? I would like him to send Kimiko to the boardroom in, let's say fifteen minute's time? Sorry to send you off without any chat or anything. I promise I'll explain later."<br><br>Jackson gave Mitch an understanding look and made to set off out on her job then stopped.<br><br>"Uh, Mitch, I don't know if this is a good or bad time..."<br><br>"Always a good time."<br><br>"My contract is up again soon. And I..."<br><br>Mitch smiled. "Don't tell me you want to extend it again?" Jackson laughed. Unlike the other mailgirls who were permanent employees of Harada Industries in Australia, Jackson had chosen short-term contracts. "Consider it done," Mitch confirmed. "How long do you want?"<br><br>Jackson crossed her arms and gave Mitch a knowing look. "Well, I'm thinking about it. How about another six months?" she suggested.<br><br>"Sure." He looked her in the eyes with real fondness. But he could not resist a dig at her. "You are enjoying it this much?" Jackson smiled and licked her lips. She did not need to say anything to that. "Is there anything else?" Mitch asked her.<br><br>"Well, not at the moment." To Mitch's relief she still had not reverted to her usual banter. She straightened up, her taut breasts shimmering slightly. "I better get your message to Shane." And she left the office without a look sideways at either of the two women outside his office. Mitch sighed and tried to imagine how his next mailgirl interaction would go. He had fifteen minutes to think of something.<br><br>Kimiko was sitting at the head of the boardroom table when Mitch entered. Seeing him she swivelled around in the chair, almost giving him the impression that she was running a meeting, even if it was just Mitch. And she was of course nude. She smiled at Mitch as he approached her. "Yes?" Kimiko asked as she gestured around the room at the art pieces on the walls. "Which one would you like me to try today?"<br><br>"There will be plenty of time for that," Mitch smiled.<br><br>"Are you mocking me?"<br><br>Mitch smiled. "No, I'm actually telling you there will be plenty of time." He paused for effect. "Ah, of course. You don't know either. Well, we have a visitor who I understand knows Kinbaku." As he expected, Mitch now had Kimiko's full attention. "Mrs Ogawa." Kimiko looked blank, so he continued. "From the videos. She is Mr Harada, ah, your grandfather's enforcer."<br><br>Kimiko realised. "The one with the whip."<br><br>Mitch nodded. "Yes, the one with the whip. There's just one problem." Mitch took a deep breath. "She's sitting with Betty Cuthbert at the moment. And she has no English."<br><br>Kimiko laughed as she realised. "You need me to look after her?" Mitch smiled along with Kimiko. "So I would need to go everywhere with her and translate for her? Granddad won't be happy."<br><br>Mitch tried to compose himself. "That's a problem? For you?"<br><br>"No, that's perfect." Kimiko leaned back in her seat and stretched her legs wide, moving one hand straight down to her clit. She started to rub her hand vigorously over her clit and down to her pussy lips. She was clearly determined on a big orgasm.<br><br>Mitch waited for a moment but Kimiko was intent on continuing for as long as it took. She flexed her hips but was clearly some way away. He watched her for a moment and then stood up. "When you're done," Mitch suggested gently, "you can come to my office and I'll introduce you." He started towards the door.<br><br>"No Mitch!" Kimiko called out. "I need you... I need someone to watch me... Stay," she grunted as she went harder to work on herself.<br><br>Mitch knew he was too much of a gentleman to say no. And why shouldn't he take the time to watch his attractive employee satisfy herself according to the terms of her contract as an Australian mailgirl. So he stood there close to Kimiko but not too close, deciding for once that he could just relax and enjoy the scene in front of him. Aware that he had no idea what may happen when she and Mrs Ogawa got together.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch found his deputy Shane Crawford waiting for him when he returned to his office. Shane smiled. "Sorry to interrupt," he started, "is she being taken care of?" he gestured out at Mrs Ogawa who was still unmoving in her seat. Mitch nodded, so Shane continued. "Have you seen the video that's circulating?" Mitch gave him a 'what now' look. "Mailgirls Gone Wild in Melbourne," he announced to Mitch's mortification. "Someone — we don't know who, at least I don't — has put a video on the internet called Mailgirls Gone Wild in Melbourne. It purports to be a slice of what goes on in this office."<br><br>"Oh great," Mitch groaned.<br><br>Shane ignored that and got excited. "It's definitely not our office or our mailgirls."<br><br>Mitch looked concerned. "So we don't know where it came from?"<br><br>Shane shrugged. "Mitch, it's the internet. But we can at least ask the BAD boys to see if they can trace it," he suggested. Perhaps the IT company downstairs could help.<br><br>Mitch nodded. "So what's in it?" he asked.<br><br>"Oh, everything," Shane warned, "Super model mailgirls, idyllic office scenes. And punishments."<br><br>"What!?" Mitch demanded.<br><br>"I guess you should just see the video," Shane suggested as Mitch sat down at his desk and logged back in. Mitch googled, shaking his head at how quickly he found it. Shane walked around to watch over his boss's shoulder.<br><br>"That's not our office," Mitch exploded as he watched a hardbodied mailgirl cruise between desks filled with happy, diligent workers who gave the naked Amazon just the right amount of attention to acknowledge how her majestic beauty incentivised them to work more enthusiastically at their tasks.<br><br>"Everyone will want mailgirls now," Shane observed.<br><br>Then a polite cough from outside the office. The three looked over at Heather who appeared with her usual bright smile at the door to Mitch's office. "Yes?" she asked leaning against the door frame in a sort of 'dare me' pose.<br><br>Shane explained what he wanted her to get BAD Solutions, the IT company down on the third floor to do for them. Nodding, the ever cheerful, busty mailgirl turned towards the stairwell to run her message. Mitch noticed that Mrs Ogawa too was gone.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The next day Kimiko marched into Mitch's office with her usual air of confidence. "Can I talk?" she asked.<br><br>"Of course. Where is Mrs Ogawa?"<br><br>"She's busy with Tokyo office stuff, so she doesn't need me for a little while." Kimiko knelt down in the mailgirls waiting position on the carpet where Mitch could see that she had spread her legs. Mitch had long stopped telling her that she did not need to do that. It was her choice if she did.<br><br>"So how has she been going?" Mitch asked her.<br><br>"Somewhat interesting. She has ideas for this office." Kimiko scratched lazily below a breast.<br><br>"Of course she does. Like what?" Mitch got and came around to sit on his desk so that he could make more comfortable eye contact with the mailgirl.<br><br>"I don't think she understands our working conditions here. Or maybe she doesn't want to. I don't think she was warned properly before agreeing to come here. Since she seems to believe that she can discipline the mailgirls here the same way that she does back in Japan."<br><br>Mitch smiled at the naked woman as she stood up and stretched on her toes in front of him. "Isn't that what you wanted?" he asked her as she raised her hands straight above her head. Mitch recalled that Kimiko had on at least one occasion demanded that she be disciplined as part of her mailgirl arrangements.<br><br>"Marjorie had a word to me. Jackson," she replied. Mitch had looked confused for a moment forgetting that some staff chose to refer to the former union rep now mailgirl by her actual first name and not her surname which she preferred. "She told me that I should consider the consequences before submitting."<br><br>"So you are determined to have Mrs Ogawa discipline you?"<br><br>"Why not? I love experimenting, and this is something that I haven't done before." Balancing on her toes, she ran a finger over her pussy and smiled at Mitch. "And if I don't like it, I can always refer to our work conditions and have it stopped."<br><br>Mitch smiled back at her with a little look like a dare. "Are you sure Mrs Ogawa will stop when you tell her to?"<br><br>They looked hard into each other's eyes for a moment. Mitch could see that Kimiko was contemplating the possibility that she may have to totally surrender herself to Mr Harada's chosen enforcer, a woman who was used to getting her way. Once she started perhaps she would not be able to get out of it as easily as she had boasted. Mitch had seen the videos of Mrs Harada's work and expected that no doubt Kimiko had too. He could see that Kimiko was getting turned on by the thought that she may have to submit to her punishment and possibly lose control over what may happen to her. He noted that she was now conflicted after he had raised it. Which meant, he knew, that she was getting turned on. She slumped back in one of the seats in front of him and got to work on herself. Mitch waited for Kimiko to do what she needed to deal with that. How much of each day was he spending watching her masturbate?<br><br>"So what is she planning?" Mitch asked Kimiko after the necessary pause.<br><br>"I'm not totally sure. But I can guess. She made me take her through our performance records. I have tried to explain the work contracts to her a few times, but she either doesn't seem to pay attention or otherwise she's choosing to ignore them. But she has the monthly report that you submitted, in translation, so assuming that what she has is accurate she knows how we have been operating."<br><br>"How did you go explaining the incentive points to her?"<br><br>"Oh yeah, that. She gets it all right. But she chooses to interpret them the other way around. So she thinks she can decide who is the worst mailgirl and least performing one of us who requires the most discipline by who has the least incentive points."<br><br>Mitch groaned. "That would be Lauryn because we've had her on other work."<br><br>Kimiko nodded. "She is a fair way behind the rest of us who all have about the same amount of points. Except for Jan who is miles in front. So Mrs Ogawa keeps insisting to me that she needs to make an example of her."<br><br>"You likely know this better than me, but I think that Lauryn is the mailgirl who least wants to be disciplined."<br><br>"I wouldn't know about that." Mitch looked at her, wondering. "I don't talk much to the others about those things," she stated shyly.<br><br>Mitch shook his head and defaulted to his usual hopeful fallback plan. "Let's call in Jackson and see what she thinks."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>All the mailgirls had assembled in the boardroom. Six sets of breasts visible around the board table. Mitch sat at the head of the table with Kimiko at his side. Since the table had room for ten chairs, there were a few free. Behind Mitch, Mrs Ogawa paced in front of the white screen that had been pulled down, presumably for her presentation. She was dressed in a short sleek black leather dress with her hair tied in a strict ponytail. This restraint was at odds with the loose locks of all the mailgirls except for Kimiko who sat up straight with her long jet black hair also tied tight in the same manner as Mrs Ogawa. Except of course Kimiko was nude. The other five mailgirls sat leisurely around the table. Heather had an elbow on the table as she scratched behind an ear. She turned to Jan next to her and gestured at the boardroom walls.<br><br>"When did these pics go up?" she asked Jan. "Have they always been here?"<br><br>Jan smiled back at Heather. She had worked out that it was hard to pick whether Heather was playing ignorant or whether it was real. The six large arty prints that adorned the walls of the boardroom showed Japanese mailgirls in various arrangements of bondage. A recent enough gift from Mr Harada that some of the mailgirls were now seeing them for the first time. Some were concerned, some feigned indifference. Lauryn with her laptop open in front of her partially kept an eye on the front of the room and partly on her screen. Annette, halfway down had one knee up against the edge of the table, her crotch exposed, tilting back in her chair. Mitch noticed that Jackson had chosen to sit closest to the door with empty seats on each side of her. She seemed far more focussed on the proceedings than the others, alert in case something big might be about to change but also for nuance.<br><br>Mitch noted the group of naked employees watching him and decided it was time to start. "Thanks for all coming. I am sure you are wondering why we are here." He looked around the table. He got the sense that he had not alarmed them yet. There was enough concern given the presence of Mrs Ogawa. He couldn't imagine that Kimiko had totally clammed up with her co-workers; he expected that she must have told them something. But of course he was relying on the unpredictable Kimiko. Maybe she had said nothing to them. He added "hopefully it will all be clear by the end of the meeting." He looked around the room at his naked attendees and smiled at the dissonance of that. As Mrs Ogawa was behind him he could not see her, but he did notice Kimiko look to her. He waited but Kimiko said nothing so he assumed that Mrs Ogawa had requested nothing of her.<br><br>Mitch concluded his introduction. "Mrs Ogawa wants to show you a brief presentation and then she will be outlining a few changes that she wants to implement." That caused a frisson of concern around the table. Jackson caught Mitch's eye with a glance of warning. "It will all be good," Mitch tried to assure the mailgirl group, "and voluntary." He hoped that would do it. Again he noticed that Kimiko had not translated. Although he was sure that Mrs Ogawa would have got the vibe of the room.<br><br>Wendy Turnbull sidled in and sat next to Jackson. 'Sorry,' she mouthed at Mitch as Jackson assured her that she had missed nothing yet. So now that the mailgirls' supervisor was present, there were three people in clothes in the room.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa spoke rapidly to Kimiko. The chatter around the table stopped. "She wants to show us a short video," Kimiko announced. Mitch and Kimiko both stood up and moved to the side of the room, in front of two of the prints, so that everyone could see the screen.<br><br>Everything had been set up and Mrs Ogawa pressed play on her handheld. Mitch expected another video like Goes Wild. But, like the rest of the viewers, he was surprised to see a shot of a grassed area, perhaps a park or even a farm. Six young women capered into the scene dressed as rabbits to a cheesy instrumental disco beat. They pretended to be bunnies as they bounced around, fell onto each other and generally seemed to being having a lot of fun. Then a Japanese businessman appeared, holding a clearly fake gun. They capered around for a moment, ignoring him. Until he pretended to shoot them. And one by one they pretended to die in the hammiest possible way. With them all dead the video ended when the cheesy music played out.<br><br>The mailgirls had started laughing when the bunny girls appeared and were mostly still laughing at the end. With the screen blank at the end, Mrs Ogawa who had been staring solemnly at her audience kept her distant stare but clapped her hands for attention. She made a brief statement.<br><br>Kimiko spoke up, still standing next to Mitch. "Mrs Ogawa wants to know whether the message was clear," she stated, almost as straight as Mrs Ogawa's stance.<br><br>The other mailgirls chose to stare quietly at Kimiko, curious who would speak first. A few looked to Jackson who stared straight ahead at Mrs Ogawa and ignored their unspoken interest in her.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa spoke again. "In that case," Kimiko reported, "she has some questions for you." Mrs Ogawa spoke and Kimiko translated. "Why do you have a bush, Heather?"<br><br>"I, um, like it," Heather stammered back. Then more confidently, "I don't want to look like a little girl. Am I am allowed to under the rules here."<br><br>"Are you fit enough to compete with American mailgirls, Jan?"<br><br>"I haven't thought about it," Jan replied. Her fellow mailgirls knew she was fit enough to compete impressively in local triathons.<br><br>"How often do you meet your targets, Lauryn?"<br><br>"I always deliver on time," Lauryn stated confidently. Mrs Ogawa raised a doubting eyebrow when Kimiko translated Lauryn's reply for her.<br><br>"Do any of us know what it would take for us to be at the same level as the mailgirls in the American office?" The group around the table looked to each other for a way out of this.<br><br>"Ask her if I can go there to find out," Heather blurted. The others laughed because, well, Heather was not going to give up on that quest. Mrs Ogawa shook her head in reply. Mitch felt that she had shown a small amount of pity for the stocky former stockgirl with the big dreams.<br><br>Annette spoke up suddenly. "Can you ask her Kimiko, why she didn't ask us whether we compare to the Japanese mailgirls too?"<br><br>Kimiko dutifully did so and got a tongue lashing from Mrs Ogawa. The mailgirls tensed in their seats. Annette recoiled, putting both her feet on the floor. "She says," Kimiko reported, "that none of us would ever compare with her mailgirls in Japan."<br><br>No one had anything to say after that. Mrs Ogawa had Kimiko tell her colleagues to think further about the meaning of the rabbit video as a way of indicating that the meeting was over. She marched out of the room leaving the rest of them somewhat shocked.<br><br>After a moment, Lauryn spoke up. "Kimiko, do you have any idea what it means?"<br><br>Kimiko shook her head and Mitch was sure that he saw her look at him as if wanting his help, but only for a moment after which she smiled and shrugged. That was enough to suggest to Mitch that Mrs Ogawa was not done, not by a long way. And everyone still present was confused by what was supposed to have changed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch and Jessica were watching the television, a quiet week night at home. Jessica excused herself during an ad break to the bathroom. Emily and Cara had been waiting for that moment as they quickly descended on Mitch, sitting down on the sofa on each side of him, Cara with a laptop ready to go.<br><br>"What's this?" Emily demanded as Cara hit play on the video they had cued up. That was enough warning to Mitch that he was going to have to watch Melbourne Mailgirls Go Wild again.<br><br>On the screen the stunning mailgirls were limbering up. "And most importantly," Cara insisted, "why aren't you in it?"<br><br>"And what about this?" Emily demanded jumping to the punishment scene. Mitch said nothing, trying not to concentrate as a tall, stunning blonde mailgirl climbed onto a table in the middle of the office, kneeling with her legs spread and her large breasts swaying as she balanced on her elbows. She was totally exposed to the room. Another equally stunning mailgirl circled her threateningly with a riding crop. While the mailgirl on the table showed no reaction, the other one laid into her calves, her thighs and then her buttocks with the whip.<br><br>Those mailgirls are hot!" Emily pouted. "At least I can see why you didn't want me."<br><br>Mitch bit his lip. It was better to say nothing than to have his daughter believe that she was not attractive enough to work naked in an office with this bunch of supermodels who were striding around an office that was supposed to be his. His daughters forced Mitch to watch a tall stern woman who was dressed much like Mrs Ogawa take the riding crop from the mailgirl when she had finished punishing the one on the table and then use it on her, whacking the calves of the unfortunate mailgirl who was standing on her toes in the pose that Emily had been practising. Cara shot Emily a knowing glance behind her father's head.<br><br>Mitch coughed and both girls looked at him. "I have actually seen this already," he told them.<br><br>"Do you really punish the mailgirls like that, dad? I thought you said that you couldn't," Emily asked him with a serious look.<br><br>Mitch tried to tell her that the video was not of his office. "It's a fake or tribute or something. We're trying to find out who put it together."<br><br>Cara fended that off. "Perhaps we could drop in to your office, you know, just to check."<br><br>At which moment Jessica returned. "Mum," Emily started, "we think Dad should let us go to his office to check up on what is going on in there."<br><br>Jessica smiled at her husband. "Isn't next Monday your 'bring your overconfident uni student daughter or daughters to work day' or something like that?" she taunted him.<br><br>Cara saw it was her turn to try. "Mum, do you get an invite to visit the office?" Jessica smiled at her without answering, so Cara took that as a negative. "No. Well, the Office Christmas party is going to be interesting," she pointed out to all of them.<br><br>Mitch hoped that none of his family had seen the brief look of concern on his face. The Office Christmas party was something that he had not thought about.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>As she opened the door to her flat, Jackson's phone rang. She looked to see who it was and swore softly. When would he get the message that no means no? She let the call go to voicemail then deleted the notification that came up. She shook off her blazer and hung it in her robe. There was something almost illicitly good about having her own flat in walking distance of the Harada office. Not too close mind. She had a healthy walk to and from work. That was part of the plan after she had calculated what her generous mailgirl salary could afford her.<br><br>She stripped off the rest of her clothes and flopped onto the lounge. It was odd, the relaxation she felt being naked in her own home, alone by herself as opposed to the low level stress of being the same around others all day. How did she feel now, in her own flat that she rented for herself? Loose, she decided. She got up and rifled through her wardrobe. At some point, she would have to decide what to wear out tonight. But for the moment, she checked through the clothes that she had not discarded before her move from the share house with Martin and the others. The suits that she no longer wore. She intended to clear them out too. There was a lot that she just did not need any more.<br><br>She checked herself in the full length mirror inside the wardrobe door and smiled, flattering herself how easily she maintained her lithe figure despite being a lazy sod who still ate anything that came in front of her. Her mailgirl physical requirements were hardly onerous. The two mailgirl triathletes made the effort to exert on their errands. They were in training and there was something in their makeup that got them high on tight muscles and sweat and cardio. Jackson slouched her jobs. She knew how little effort she needed in order to make time. And she was content with her life, the incentive points she scored were not, well, really an incentive.<br><br>Her phone rang again. She sighed but it was Fanny calling so she answered it. The psychologist was one of her few acquaintances who knew the detail about her workday. Fanny Durack had a bank of questions each time she called although her study on mailgirls was done. Why the interest, Jackson would ask her back. Fanny's answer was simple. 'I want to know everything, and trust me there will be another study at least to come out of this. I'm taking notes, so I'll be prepared.'<br><br>But this time was different. "You've seen the video," Fanny gushed.<br><br>"Of course," Jackson assured her.<br><br>"You're not in it."<br><br>"Well, since it was not shot in the Melbourne office, and it doesn't have anyone that I know from the company in it and management are trying to find out where it came from, no, I'm not in it. It is a bit rude that they didn't think of me." She hammed up her irritation.<br><br>Fanny insisted that Jackson tell her anything that she finds out about it. Jackson decided to be naughty. "I'm at home and not wearing anything at the moment," she told her friend.<br><br>"Interesting," Fanny observed. "Is this the effect of the job? Are you losing interest in clothes? Has it changed you in this way? Has it made you feel more confident about the naked you?"<br><br>"Yeah, possibly," Jackson admitted.<br><br>"And there's no replacement for Martin?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head and then remembered that she had to answer verbally. "But I have to make a decision," she admitted. To Fanny's enquiry, she added "my contract is coming up again. It was only going to be a short experiment, help them bed in the program and all that. But now there's the money..."<br><br>Fanny interrupted "...and the lifestyle..."<br><br>"Yes," Jackson agreed, "and the lifestyle, the inner city apartment and all that." She posed rudely in front of the mirror, her breasts thrust out and her legs just wide enough.<br><br>"You know what I think." Fanny thought it was good for Jackson. "But if you need to talk to someone else, how about Destinee?"<br><br>"Hardcore," Jackson laughed.<br><br>"Indeed. But she has a head on her shoulders and she can warn you if she thinks that you are getting yourself into something too deep that you should get out of. You've still got the union job to fall back on, right?"<br><br>"Yes, but they are not keeping it open for me forever. I extend this time and it's going to be hard to go back." She did feel a bit of excitement at being trapped naked with Mitch, unable to go back to the union.<br><br>"Well definitely Destinee then, girl," Fanny concluded.<br><br>Jackson noted the time on her phone after the call and realised that she needed to get ready to meet the gang. But first she called and lined up Destinee.<br><br>Samantha and Charlotte were already at the restaurant. "Don't tell me you walked," Samantha demanded when Jackson strolled in. She smiled at that. "You did, now that you're an inner city girl. Took me twenty minutes to find a park."<br><br>Jackson air kissed both her friends. "Where's Carrie? Running late?" she laughed because Carrie was always running late.<br><br>Indeed Carrie bustled in almost right behind Jackson. "I guess you walked," she repeated and observed again for everyone's benefit that Jackson was now a city girl. She flopped down in the remaining seat and looked at the other two. "I guess that you haven't dragged anything out of our friend here about her mystery job?"<br><br>"We haven't had any time yet," Charlotte directed at Jackson.<br><br>"She only just got here," Samantha told Carrie.<br><br>Carrie plonked herself down just as Jackson did too. She made sure she had Jackson's attention. "Well, let's start the interrogation. Jackson, you're obviously being paid a bomb to be able to afford your city abode. So the union stuff was just a stepping stone." Jackson gave her a smug smile.<br><br>"Come on, why the secrecy?" Charlotte demanded.<br><br>Jackson wondered about that too. Was she embarrassed to tell them what she was doing? Was there really any reason to be discrete? After all, enough people knew what was going on inside Harada Industries. Although she suspected that these three friends — like most of her other friends, and particularly her ex-boyfriends — could never imagine that she would have the nerve to do what she was doing. "It's part of the deal," she tried to explain, her weasel words to get her out of the questioning. "I have always done a lot of stuff that I can't talk about."<br><br>"Yeah, but in the past at least you would tell us who you were doing it for."<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "It's the modern world, everything is just too traceable. So I'm sorry but you'll just have to accept that I am healthy, I'm being well paid and keeping myself out of trouble." They mumbled their acceptance of that while still all vowing to keep pressing her to get details out. Even threatening to get her drunk.<br><br>And there were other matters. "Still single?" Carrie checked with Jackson.<br><br>She reported that was correct. Her three friends nodded. The general consensus was that she was too good for Martin. He had not been seen by any of them since the breakup. As far as they knew he was well out of the picture. During the meal, Jackson was again questioned but did not crack.<br><br>At the end of the night she pecked her friends on their cheeks as they tried once more to prise her secrets out. She walked home, feeling confident in the dark but knowing that she had come no closer to sorting the dilemma that was irking her. Fortunately she had another catch up planned.<br><br>Jackson called an Uber when she got home. She got a raised eyebrow from the driver when she confirmed the destination. Driving a woman to Caringbush Secrets in the middle of the night could mean one of two things but both of them meant sex. Jackson thought what the Hell and got the Uber to stop in the street outside the converted townhouse so that she would enter from the street. She knew about the discrete back entrance and how to get there, but she felt brazen. So why not?<br><br>The receptionist opened the door for her and gave her a scowl. "Bit late for union business," she sneered.<br><br>Jackson tried to disarm her with a smile. "Is Destinee free?"<br><br>"Just finishing up with someone. If you don't mind taking a seat." Jackson graciously accept her invitation and then equally graciously turned down the offer of a drink while she was waiting. Midweek seemed pretty quiet since she was alone in the lounge. But she chose not to try any small talk or shop talk with the receptionist who presumably held a grudge from something previous.<br><br>Jackson guessed that something she had done, maybe some changes she had insisted on had make the receptionist's job more complicated than she wanted. She mused how when she had her clothes on she was a hard-headed negotiator and determined to get things resolved the way that she wanted. Was that something she was losing through being a naked messenger every day? She didn't miss the stress of her union role and she had to admit that she enjoyed getting off in the workplace whenever she felt like it. And there was the weird situation where she was respected and consulted by management on her areas of expertise while happily wanking herself in front of them as she helped them with their issues. Which was, she knew, very odd. Very, very odd.<br><br>Her reverie was broken by reception telling her gruffly to go three doors down the hallway and knock. Destinee was ready for her now. "Enjoy," she sang out unconvincingly as the former union rep followed her instructions and went down the hall.<br><br>Jackson knocked on the indicated door and after hearing an inviting 'yes', she entered to find Destinee nude, drying her large fake boobs and then between her legs with no indication at all of any shame as Jackson entered. That was something that she could empathise with given her own recent experience.<br><br>Recognising her visitor Destinee dropped her towel and approached Jackson with open arms. "It's been a while, give me a hug," she insisted. Jackson felt overdressed in her pullover, jeans and boots in the stuffy room. "Take off your clothes if you feel more comfortable," Destinee laughed as she retreated to pick her towel back off the floor. "But then you are probably doing enough of that anyway."<br><br>Jackson kept her clothes on and sat on the bed as Destinee wrapped herself in a see-through robe. The escort walked back up to Jackson and taking her gently by the chin, looked into her eyes. "How are you finding your new career?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "Pretty easy," she admitted, "surprisingly."<br><br>Destinee smiled. "I always thought you had it in you for sex work."<br><br>"It's not sex work," Jackson complained.<br><br>"Sure," Destinee retorted. "Just showing your body all day to people with their clothes on. That's not sex work. I'll admit I'm jealous. I knew that you'd kill it." Jackson tried to protest. "I can see things that you can't," Destinee insisted. She gently took Jackson's hand in hers. "Now share your dilemma."<br><br>Jackson relaxed and explained about her career and continuing the contract. Destinee fired the sort of questions that Jackson needed to hear at her. How did she enjoy the work? What would she be giving up? What concerns did she have about what she was doing? Jackson admitted that they were good questions and ones that she did not confidently have answers to.<br><br>And then Destinee changed tack. "How about your sex drive?"<br><br>Jackson looked her friend in the eye. "All over the place. High at work, well sometimes, it varies, and then when I get home nothing. I broke up with my boyfriend and I have no desire for another one." Jackson got the chance to turn the conversation. "How about you?"<br><br>Destinee laughed. "I only do women these days."<br><br>"What?! Do management mind?"<br><br>"Not so long as I keep getting the bookings coming in. Now how about you. Is there anyone at work?" Jackson smiled back at her confidante. But Jackson would not give the name away to Destinee. However her expression left her friend in no doubt that there certainly was someone. And it was unrequited.<br><br>"Well, there's only one thing for it," as she let her robe fall loose. Destinee pressed her bare breasts against Jackson squeezing the mailgirl in a caress. "Let's get that jumper off."<br><br>Jackson protested "that's not what I came here for," but Destinee feigned not to hear as she lifted the garment over Jackson's head so she could work on her now bare breasts.<br><br>"Pants off too," Destinee ordered as she slipped out of her robe now completely nude herself. Jackson could only marvel at how easily Destinee then stripped her of her boots and jeans and panties.<br><br>"I didn't come here for this," she tried in vain as Destinee pressed their bodies together, forcing Jackson onto her back on the bed.<br><br>"I think you did," Destinee mused as she nuzzled Jackson's cheek before going to work on her.<br><br>They held each other afterwards. "You are a total sexual being," Destinee insisted, "no wonder you are so good at the mailgirl thing."<br><br>"Perhaps you're right," Jackson conceded as weakly as she had managed to resist Destinee's initial assault. "Of course I'll pay on the way out," she tried as well.<br><br>"You'll do no such thing. I still owe you," Destinee insisted.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "We owe each other equally, I think. And it makes things a lot tidier with your reception if I do. And these days I can afford it."<br><br>"You come back then. Soon," Destinee ordered, with a big smile.<br><br>"Sure will!" Jackson felt comfortable that she had got a bit of control back. And as she had hoped, Destinee had in her way make a lot of things clearer to her.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jan wandered into Mitch's office in her usual confident way as if naked or not she owned the place. Mitch was pleased to see that Mrs Ogawa's presence had not changed her behaviour, at least outwardly. He was on the lookout for any reactions to the new regime. Particularly today, given the nature of the message that he was expecting Jan to deliver to him.<br><br>"The people from Fair Work Commission have done their paperwork and stuff and are waiting in reception," she told him. Mitch thanked her and started to get himself organised to collect them. "You're not sending Betty down?" she asked.<br><br>"Probably be better if I got them myself," he told her.<br><br>"Can I ask why? What are they here for?" the mailgirl probed.<br><br>Mitch remembered to tag her off the errand. Incentive points had become more important, he knew. "They say that they're here about the video." Jan looked at him, clearly wondering why. "The Go Wild one. Apparently it breaks some of the conditions of your contracts and they had to come here to investigate."<br><br>"Sounds like an excuse," Jan sniggered.<br><br>"You're probably correct," Mitch agreed. "But I checked with Jackson and apparently they have the power."<br><br>"And Mrs Ogawa?" Jan asked with a smirk.<br><br>"Hopefully Kimiko is keeping her occupied." He smiled at Jan. "In a benign way."<br><br>Jan laughed. "Who knows with those two?" They were both wondering what could result from the Fair Work people finding Mrs Ogawa practising her correctional arts on Kimiko. Apparently Mrs Ogawa had already used rope on her although Mitch had not yet seen.<br><br>So he shook his head in agreement with Jan's concerns. "Anyway, I better not keep them waiting any longer. Otherwise it will be Betty going up to collect them."<br><br>They left the office together. Mitch smiled at Betty Cuthbert as he walked in step with the tall, lithe mailgirl who promised him she would try to locate Kimiko but could not guarantee to be able to control her if she did find her in time. Typically, Betty scowled at her boss's easy camaraderie with the naked mailgirl. Jan checked her app and seeing nothing happening went down towards the mezzanine to look for Kimiko and Mrs Ogawa there first. Mitch went up to the fourth floor reception.<br><br>He found a middle aged woman and a youngish eager looking male waiting outside reception. They introduced themselves as Angela and James.<br><br>"I don't think we've met?" Mitch asked them.<br><br>"We've only just been given this assignment," Angela answered sharply. Perhaps, wondered Mitch, it would not be a bad thing to have sent Betty for them after all. She could have knocked some sharpness off the visitors. He took them back down to his floor and led them to the boardroom. At least Mrs Ogawa and Kimiko were not there. Mitch watched James' eyes light up as he noticed the prints on the walls. Angela acted as if she had seen it all before. She opened her laptop, checked her notes and looked over the top of it at Mitch then sharply at James who finally getting the message from her went to his bag and opened his laptop too.<br><br>Satisfied that James was at least appearing professional, Angela started to read her spiel from her laptop. "It has come to the Fair Work Commission's attention that there may be a breach of the conditions of work of your mailgirls that was agreed to."<br><br>"Specifically?" Mitch asked.<br><br>"The existence of a video called Melbourne Mailgirls Go Wild has been brought to our attention," Angela read out, trying to show no emotion as she proceded. "It shows certain incidences which contravene our agreement with Harada Industries as to how mailgirls will perform their duties under the Fair Work Act."<br><br>"I am aware of the existence of this video," Mitch responded as earnestly as he could. He caught the eye of James and winked which broke James into a wide smile, trying to hold in his laugh. Angela noticed and glared at James for his break in decorum. However, the damage was done. Mitch grinned widely at Angela who managed to maintain her detached air. "How do you wish to proceed?" Mitch asked her.<br><br>"We need to establish if the acts depicted in the video have occurred in this office and if so, then we need to consider remediation."<br><br>"Can I say something?" Mitch asked and she nodded. "The video was not shot in the office, the women in the video are not our mailgirls, and we are trying to find out ourselves who made the video and why. Personally I'm not even sure that it was made in this country. If you want, I can take you for a floor walk and hopefully that way we can confirm that what you have seen did not happen here."<br><br>Angela thought about that for a moment. She nodded her assent. "We are on the?"<br><br>"...the sixth floor," Mitch completed for her.<br><br>Angela looked around the walls of the boardroom. She concentrated on a colour print of a woman hung upside down from the roof by an intricate thick rope that appeared to wrap around her waist and her crotch and also tie her arms behind her back. The woman had no readable expression on her face.<br><br>"A gift from our Japanese office," Mitch explained.<br><br>"It sets a sort of tone," Angela observed dryly, clearly giving Mitch a warning. "An expectation of the way that women are treated in this workplace."<br><br>"I guess you have regular landscape prints in your meeting rooms?" Mitch countered.<br><br>"Your point being?" Angela challenged.<br><br>"To an extent the art on the walls sets the tone for your office. One could argue that a regular outback landscape in a meeting room represents a certain benign ambiance while in a more, let's say, progressive company such as ours where mailgirls have been approved to work naked, approved by your agency, having some cutting edge artwork defines the atmosphere of this office. And this is the boardroom. It's not exactly a public display. People need to have a reason to be here."<br><br>"It's not exactly female positive," Angela countered.<br><br>"That," concluded Mitch, "is a matter of opinion." He chose not to attempt a feminist defence of the mailgirl program and said no more.<br><br>"Well, this boardroom does not appear in the video, so at least we can cross one room off," Angela huffed.<br><br>Mitch led the Fair Work employees around the rest of the floor, introducing them to Betty Cuthbert who greeted them with a cautious level of politeness before he suggested that they visit the mezzanine. "I think you will find that our mailgirls' change rooms looks nothing like what is on the video." Mitch looked deeply into James' eyes with apparent seriousness. "Are you prepared to meet some mailgirls?"<br><br>James seemed to take a step back to Angela's apparent disapproval. "Come on, let's go," she ordered him. "Can you carry my laptop?" They took the lift down to the mezzanine.<br><br>Mitch decided to play up to James' embarrassment and Angela's aloofness. "Just remember that our mailgirls are normal people just like you and me. They have a job to do here. Within rules approved by the Fair Work Commission. It's just that they do it without clothes on. While the rest of the staff are expected to be respectful and clothed."<br><br>Angela audibly huffed at that. "That's all very well," she retorted, "so long as they are not being coerced or punished in a manner that is contrary to the work agreements that the Fair Work Commission is overseeing."<br><br>"You will of course be able to establish that when you meet them. Not forgetting the evidence in front of you about the nature of the backgrounds that you can see in the video." They walked from the lift to a set of doors with glazed glass. "They are just in here.<br><br>"It's not very private," Angela chided.<br><br>"The mailgirls don't use the lifts during work hours," Mitch replied. "They use the stairs, which are accessible from behind the doors." He swiped his card and a door clicked open. Mitch held it for the two visitors to walk through. Once the door was closed behind them, Mitch advised "we just have to walk behind this partition. He looked hard again at James, for some reason enjoying the younger man's discomfort. "Ready?" Mitch challenged him. James paled but did not answer.<br><br>They walked behind the partition and the room was empty.<br><br>Mitch smiled brightly. "They are all on assignments I guess at the moment." he checked his app to confirm. "But it gives us the chance to compare this change room with the one in the video. You'll see that this one is a good deal smaller and less well furnished than what you see on your screen."<br><br>He let the two visitors run the start of the Go Wild video to confirm what he had just said. Angela looked at the video for a moment and then began to pace the room leaving Mitch alone with James.<br><br>James quickly stepped up close to whisper to Mitch. "She doesn't believe that any woman would want to willingly become a mailgirl," James blurted. "She wants to see one and talk to her to find out."<br><br>Mitch laughed. "And you don't?"<br><br>Angela came back over to James, got him to replay the video, and they both nodded. Mitch saw that but stayed silent. The door at the stairs slammed. And a naked woman dashed in. Mitch recognised Heather McKay. She recognised him and then noticed the other two.<br><br>"Mitch," she ordered, "they're not supposed to be here." But she did nothing to try to cover up her prominent breasts or her crotch as she stood near the entrance.<br><br>"It's all right, they're with me," Mitch assured her. Heather looked unconvinced. "They're from the Fair Work Commission, checking that things are running okay," Mitch continued.<br><br>Heather placed her hands on her hips to confront the two visitors. "So what do you want to know?" she demanded of them.<br><br>"You weren't in the Go Wild video," Angela asked, managing to appear professional.<br><br>"How carefully did you watch it? Did you see me in it?" Heather taunted. She turned front on at James. "And you, are you getting an eyeful?" she demanded of the poor guy.<br><br>"That's not necessary," Angela snapped.<br><br>"You're right, it's not," Heather responded, keeping an eye on James. "But it's fun." She turned to confront Angela. "Ever thought of working in the nude?" she asked her. Getting no reaction, Heather feigned to soften her approach. "You know, you would fit right in here." Before Angela could manage a reply, Heather's app beeped. She looked at it. "They want me in IT," she announced, "gotta run." And she was off, heading back in the direction that she came from. The door slammed behind her.<br><br>"So now you've seen a mailgirl," Mitch shrugged.<br><br>"Are they all like that?" James spoke up, but carefully.<br><br>"She's one of the nicer ones," Mitch responded holding James' attention with a serious look. He then relented and smiled. "They're fine once you get used to them. But being a mailgirl seems to give them a certain biting edge in their approach to fabrics."<br><br>"Fabrics," Angela stated. "I'll remember that."<br><br>"Right," asked Mitch, "where would you like to go next?" Although he was sure this was one problem solved.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The next day, Mitch sat at his desk. Jan returned from a circuit of the office and reported back to Mitch. "Mrs Harada isn't at her usual desk. I guess she's taken Kimiko somewhere."<br><br>Mitched nodded back at the waiting mailgirl. "I guess that whatever they are up to, it's no good. Can you try again to track them down? In case they have forgotten about the meeting with Mr Harada in ten minutes." Mitch wondered how likely it was that Mrs Ogawa would have forgotten that. But you never know, he pondered. She may just as likely turn that into a slur on his management in the eyes of Mr Harada. Jan went off on her mission while Mitch pondered his fate.<br><br>Jan DM'ed Mitch a few moments later that she had found them on level 8 and they were on their way down. And she added 'prepare yourself!'<br><br>Mrs Ogawa soon sailed past Betty Cuthbert's desk. As usual she was immaculately dressed, in a tight form-fitting black leather dress that shone under the office lights. Her matching black bolero top's square shoulders emphasised her domineering facial expression. She strode in what looked like four inch stilettos with her head held high. Not even turning to acknowledge Betty, she marched past her desk, holding a rope. Because she was leading Kimiko by that rope which was neatly bound above and below the naked mailgirl's breasts, securing her arms behind her back and coiled around both of Kimiko's white thighs. Kimiko strode proudly in this state, not seemingly fussed by her strange state, even for a naked mailgirl in an office that had seemed to get used to them.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa barked something at Kimiko as they both stood inside Mitch's doorway.<br><br>"She says that we should have this meeting in the boardroom," Kimiko told Mitch as though there was nothing out of the ordinary in her appearance. Mitch shrugged and nodded. What could he say? So Mrs Ogawa led Kimiko out of Mitch's office. He followed, stopping at Betty's desk. "We're having the meeting with Mr Harada in the boardroom," he told his PA. She immediately stood up. "I'll go in and set it up for you," she told him because they both knew that she did not trust Mitch to get the video connection working first time.<br><br>So Betty followed the black clad enforcer from Japan who led the rope-bound mailgirl with Mitch following behind. Mrs Ogawa briefly addressed Kimiko as they entered the boardroom. The leather clad enforcer sat down close to the screen where Mr Harada would be appearing and Kimiko knelt on the floor close to her, maintaining her impassive facade. Mrs Ogawa held the rope. Betty fiddled with the controls for a moment and quickly brought up Mr Harada. Mitch sat at the board table across from Mrs Ogawa, watched, waited and wondered what was in stock for him next.<br><br>Mr Harada acknowledged Betty warmly and invited her to stay for the meeting, but she politely declined and left with her job successfully done. And a passing glare at Kimiko. Mr Harada addressed Mrs Ogawa in Japanese. After she replied they paused. Kimiko told Mitch that they had only exchanged pleasantries and that Mrs Ogawa had told Mr Harada that everything was fine with her and she was settling in and getting used to the new culture.<br><br>The meeting continued like this for a few more minutes with Kimiko on her knees close to Mrs Ogawa. Mitch remembered to concentrate on Mr Harada on the screen who was asking about the incentive points. Then, while Mitch was answering and trying to not sound exasperated at having to explain that process to Mr Harada yet again as well as pause while Kimiko translated in snatches, Mrs Ogawa pushed Kimiko over onto her side with the toe of her shoe. The bound mailgirl lay there helpless although she kept translating without apparently missing a beat. Although Mitch was distracted, Mrs Ogawa maintained her gaze on the screen, connecting with Mr Harada, while using her foot to spread Kimiko's legs. She then placed the tip of one shoe close to the mailgirl's crotch, close enough that Kimiko lurched towards it so that her clit could make contact with the footwear to give her some chance at relief. Mrs Ogawa let Kimiko rub herself there for a moment then pulled away for a while before allowing her further contact for another short moment. With her hands bound, Kimiko had little mobility and had to rely on Mrs Ogawa's whim for her pleasure.<br><br>Mitch realised that Mr Harada was talking to his granddaughter. "Are you appreciating Mrs Ogawa's lessons?" he asked her in English. Mrs Ogawa rolled Kimiko over so that she faced her grandfather although still prone on the floor with her legs spread wide.<br><br>"Yes, Grandfather," she dutifully replied and then translated the exchange into Japanese while Mrs Ogawa continued to torment her. Then Mrs Ogawa stopped suddenly and looked momentarily surprised. Mitch realised she must have only just found out the relationship between Kimiko and the boss of the company. Mrs Ogawa took a moment to compose herself before she again let Kimiko rub herself against the tip of her shoe. As a treat she even let Kimiko absorb the tip into her vagina for a moment.<br><br>As this happened, Mr Harada picked up on his conversation with Kimiko. "I have been speaking with your mother," he continued. "She is pleased that you are enjoying working for the family company." Kimiko responded in Japanese, pausing for a couple of shudders of pleasure. Distracted by the release that Mrs Ogawa allowed her, she did not translate that into English. Which left Mitch unsure of what news was being shared in the family. He decided to leave the matter open, realising he did not want to know. Mrs Ogawa permitted Kimiko an orgasm. While the mailgirl was evidently enjoying that, Mitch watched Mr Harada but again he could not read his boss's demeanour and was left with no idea of what the ramifications may be. Mr Harada, like Mrs Ogawa kept his emotions off his face.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Away in his office tucked at the back of the tenth floor, Shane looked up from his screen, disturbed by a visitor. "Jackson, I don't expect you up here."<br><br>"Uninvited too," Jackson noted. "Are you working on something?" They both laughed. "Good," she said, "I need to discuss something with you."<br><br>"I'm all ears," Shane replied looking up at Jackson who stretched up to her full height, standing in front of his desk, her pert breasts enticingly close to him.<br><br>"And eyes," she added with a smile.<br><br>"Of course," Shane agreed still ogling her. "I don't get a chance with you that often. At least not alone."<br><br>"Yes," Jackson responded, "I know you," affecting a handbra with one arm while keeping her crotch visible. "I am thinking of extending my contract and staying on. And you seem to have different views about this company than Mitch does. I was wondering what you can tell me about what is going on."<br><br>"Well, there's a bit going on obviously. Let's get more comfortable," Shane suggested gesturing at his couch. Jackson planted herself in the middle. It was big enough to easily hold another two people. She wondered for a moment what was up as Shane got up from behind his desk and headed towards her with that lascivious smile on his face. She crossed her legs and gave him a warning look. Shane stopped his approach and stood in front of her for a moment. He then walked over to his small meeting table, turned one of the hard backed chairs towards Jackson before swinging it around and sitting astride the chair, his elbows on the armrest.<br><br>"Thank you, that makes me feel safe now," Jackson laughed.<br><br>"You're always safe with me," Shane retorted with mock astonishment that anyone could feel any different around him. "Is it Mrs Ogawa?"<br><br>Jackson nodded. "It's her, the pictures in the boardroom, the Go Wild video."<br><br>"What about the video?" Shane asked. "Do you know something?"<br><br>"I have a theory," Jackson suggested. Shane indicated he was paying serious attention, so she continued. "I suspect that it's an inside job. Not here in this office. I have this wild idea that it came out of the US office."<br><br>"Any proof?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "No proof. But the pressure from the other offices to conform to their programs. And Mitch's determination not to flaunt us in public like in the States and Japan. What do you think?"<br><br>Shane nodded. "No proof. But I was thinking the same thing. Although I haven't got a clue what we can do about it. But you've got your contracts, with all the conditions. And you've got Mitch. He's not going to rock your boat."<br><br>Jackson agreed that was all true. And she knew that she had made her mind up.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch booked a meeting with the mailgirls for 10am. He had called Jackson into his office earlier to warn her. But still he was surprised when he went down to the mezzanine at the appointed time to find that all six mailgirls were there.<br><br>"Good to see that you are all here today," he started.<br><br>"What do you mean by that?" Lauryn challenged without looking up from her laptop.<br><br>Jackson shushed her. "He's right, Lauryn, this rarely happens," she reminded the business analyst who responded to her peer by looking over to her momentarily, nodding her acceptance of the fact and then went back to what was on her screen.<br><br>"I've blocked your apps for the next half an hour," Mitch continued, "so we won't be interrupted."<br><br>"What will happen to the office?" teased Annette. "You know, the productivity."<br><br>"Probably nothing," Mitch smiled. "But I do have something to tell you, obviously."<br><br>The mailgirls all swapped amused looks at that until Heather grew worried at the implication of that. "You're going to shut us down?" she worried.<br><br>"No," Mitch assured them. "It's actually the opposite of that. Mr Harada has funded us to hire another two mailgirls, additional to you." He let that sink in for a moment.<br><br>Kimiko spoke up first. "Is this a way to get rid of me?" she asked.<br><br>Mitch tried to look concerned for her. "Probably. But before you or Jackson point out the clauses in your contract, don't worry, we can't get rid of you like that even if we wanted to. Which I don't." He checked that Kimiko was well enough satisfied with his statement before he continued. He nodded at Jackson who gave a sign of agreement. "You're probably going to ask where we are going to get these other two mailgirls from."<br><br>He paused. So Jan parroted him. "Where are you going to get the other two mailgirls from?"<br><br>"Well," Mitch smiled, "being a mailgirl is not something anyone can do..."<br><br>"I'll say," Heather chimed in, "all that training we had to complete."<br><br>Mitch shook his head at her. "You're not going to let that go, are you?"<br><br>Heather smiled at him. "The US company is going to be running training sessions for other companies who want to introduce mailgirls. Enrolments are open for another week." She brought up the webpage and turned her laptop to show Mitch. "Did you know about this? You could send me."<br><br>Mitch remembered that he had prepared himself for being a lone male trapped in a room with six naked women who were bent on intimidating him. Even though he was the boss. He blocked certain feelings but made a mental note to check that Emily wasn't planning a trip to the States and then he soldiered on with what he had planned to say, sidestepping Heather's challenge. "I am here to tell you that management and HR have agreed that our first line of recruitment is for you to tell us of anyone that you know who may be interested in becoming a mailgirl. You know what it is like, so you would have an idea if anyone you knew was suitable."<br><br>Lauryn stretched back on her bench, thrusting out her breasts and spreading her legs at Mitch. "Or unsuitable," she punned. Mitch looked at her, confused. "Un suit able. Not wearing a suit, Mitch," she explained running a finger down her side, over a nipple and towards her pussy.<br><br>"Thanks," Mitch gritted. "Any other bad puns?" But he could see that the cohort were all busy thinking of who they knew that they could recruit. "And yes," he added, "there will be a finder's fee."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson sailed past Betty Cuthbert to enter Mitch's office. He looked up at her. "Have you got a moment," she asked.<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"Do you still have vacancies for the new mailgirls?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "I haven't had a nibble yet."<br><br>"Do you remember Fanny Durack?" Mitch shook his head because he didn't. "Does the research paper 'A satisfied mailgirl is a happy mailgirl.' ring a bell?" Mitch looked a little less vague. "A shortish woman, large bust." Mitch looked more vague. Jackson shook her head. "You are hopeless. Let me remind you. I brought this not unattractive psychologist to one of our planning meetings. She was the one who came up with the idea of the dildo stations. I spoke to her last night, and she would be interested in doing some personal in-the-field testing. She said it would help with getting some genuine results for her study. She would be happy to sign up for a fixed term, say, six months, to see how much research she could get done during that time."<br><br>Mitch smiled. "And we both know how that works." He smiled at the naked mailgirl who for once looked vulnerable, sitting bare in front of him, advocating to get the clothes off her colleague. Jackson squirmed in her seat. Mitch smiled at the sudden power discrepancy. "Six months, right?" he taunted her. And he let that sit for a moment while Jackson smiled hopefully. "Is there a conflict of interest?" he checked.<br><br>Jackson perked up since she had thought about that and discussed it with Fanny. "She may suggest not telling the others that she is studying in the area because that may skew her observations." Jackson sat up straight. Her breasts were on display as well as the top of her slit.<br><br>Mitch took in the view of his somewhat restrained tormentor and sighed. "That sounds totally ethical." He shook his head at the thought of Jackson bringing a close ally into the office.<br><br>Jackson smirked with the realisation and returned to her more usual self. "I'll tell her to get herself prepared then. When can she start?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Up on the tenth floor Shane was going through the draft monthlies with Mitch when Jan came into his office. "Yes, Jan?" he asked.<br><br>Jan gave Shane a knowing look. "Actually I'm here with a message for Mitch. "Someone is in your office to see you," she smiled at him.<br><br>Mitch thanked the tall mailgirl and then saw something in her smile. "Who sent you?" he asked with a broad smile himself.<br><br>Jan looked down at her feet in an attempt to not lose herself in a complete breakdown of laughter. She took a moment to compose herself. "Betty Cuthbert," she advised in a stage whisper, making sure to avoid eye contact with either Mitch or with Shane.<br><br>Shane couldn't control himself. "Tell me that's a joke, Jan," he exploded in mirth.<br><br>Jan broke down in giggles "I can't. It's the truth," she advised when she had recovered. This was a moment that all three would saviour, Betty having finally cracked and used a mailgirl.<br><br>Mitch shook his head as he got up to return there.<br><br>"The revolution has finally started," Shane announced. He looked at Jan with a smile. "Are you going to wait here for your next job?" She shrugged. When she knew Mitch was not looking, she rolled her eyes at Shane.<br><br>Mitch returned to his office. Betty Cuthbert was busy with something on her computer. He stopped near her desk for a moment. She noticed without looking up. "You left your phone on your desk," she told him concentrating on her screen without giving anything away with her intonation. So Mitch continued on into his office.<br><br>He found a shortish woman dressed in sensible office wear sitting at his desk, waiting for him. Initially she reminded him of Heather. But when she turned on hearing his entrance, he recognised the architect of the dildo stations and remembered that he had used her research to help develop their mailgirl program. They reintroduced themselves, chastely shook hands then Mitch suggested that they should go to the boardroom.<br><br>"Very impressive," Fanny smiled as she took a moment to admire the prints on the walls. "Is it supposed to represent your core outputs?"<br><br>Mitch gave her an eyeroll. "It seems like it sometimes," he agreed. Mitch camped himself at the end of the long table pushing his chair back from the board table and turning to face Fanny. "What sort of research findings are you interested in?" he asked as she took off her jacket and placed it carefully on the table, not far from where Mitch sat.<br><br>Fanny remained standing, facing Mitch as she started her spiel. "I am interested in the effect of mailgirls on the office. And the effect of the office on the mailgirls. Productivity, respect, all the issues that I can measure coming from interviewing the main participants..."<br><br>"Both mailgirls and fabrics?"<br><br>"Fabrics," she repeated and laughed. "Indeed, absolutely." Fanny unbuttoned her blouse as she explained her research to Mitch. The blouse came off revealing her bra covered a bust that was larger than Mitch expected. As well, Fanny revealed a taut, muscular chest. "I have obviously studied the US and Japanese implementations from a distance and reviewed the papers that have been published on those." She slid off her bra revealing large soft breasts that still held their shape without the support of the bra which she nonchalantly placed on the growing stack of her clothes on the table. Fanny seemed to ignore her display as she kept up her explanation. "I have discussed it with my academic supervisor," she mentioned as she stepped out of her skirt and lowered her panties. "To some extent, she is happy for me to collect what data I can and see where my research leads me." As she said that, Fanny took a few steps back to pose for Mitch, to give him a clear view of her body. Inadvertently she stood near a print of a Japanese model on her knees with her hands tied behind her with the rope across her chest forcing her breasts forward, almost in sync with her own stance. "Am I an acceptable mailgirl?" she asked Mitch with a twinkle in her eye.<br><br>'I think so," Mitch replied, matching her playful tone. He went into his spiel. "I'm not sure how long you need for your research but so long as you are here, you are a mailgirl and we will treat you like all the other mailgirls. You'll be on the same pay and have the same conditions."<br><br>"I'll appreciate the money," she admitted which lowered any tension in the room between the naked soon-to-be mailgirl who stood in front of the clothed manager of the office.<br><br>Mitch seemed to lean back further in his seat. "You'd like to be known as?" he asked.<br><br>"Fanny. That's my name," she responded firmly.<br><br>Mitch faultered. "Oh, what with Jackson..."<br><br>Fanny set back her shoulders which shimmered her breasts. "I'm Fanny and she's Jackson. We're two different people."<br><br>"Of course you are," Mitch agreed.<br><br>At that moment the boardroom door opened. The tall, muscular Belinda Clark walked in. "I'm not interrupting anything," she called out.<br><br>Fanny immediately went to cover her breasts and her crotch.<br><br>"You're not going to be much of a mailgirl if you walk around like that," Belinda noted as she strode past Fanny to stand near Mitch. "By the way, I'm the head of HR, that's why I'm here."<br><br>Fanny dropped her hands to her side. She had not noticed that Belinda had left the door open. Wendy came in too. Fanny only realised that she had an audience of three when Wendy stood in front of her to give her the once over.<br><br>"Nice," Wendy observed. "You look ready to start straight away if you want to." Wendy turned Fanny around as if she was inspecting her for blemishes.<br><br>"And my clothes?" Fanny asked somewhat nervously.<br><br>"On a normal working day you'd put them in your locker on the mezzanine at the start of the day," Wendy assured her, "but we have to set you up on the app before you begin." She and Belinda sat at either side of Mitch. Belinda placed a pile of papers on the table and Mitch gestured for Fanny to sit down in front of them. She did.<br><br>"Now," Belinda started after taking a deep breath, "we have some contractual stuff to go through with you." She pointed at the papers and took the first one off the pile to reveal its contents.<br><br>Wendy shook her head so Belinda stopped and looked to her. "I just have to say," Wendy exclaimed, "that your breasts are magnificent."<br><br>Fanny tried to give an appreciative look that did not quite work out. Mitch looked over at the mailgirls' supervisor. "Wendy!" he exclaimed.<br><br>"I'm sorry," she responded. "But someone has to say it."<br><br>Mitch looked towards Fanny. "I don't think I introduced you. Wendy is your direct supervisor. She will inspect you every morning and look after any issues that you may have."<br><br>"Sorry," Wendy said.<br><br>"That's all right," Fanny responded brightly. Strangely the physical comment seemed to have put her more at ease as she paid attention to Belinda who began to recite the details of her job.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Four people were in the meeting, Wendy, Belinda, Shane, and Mitch. Mitch mentioned that they needed to hire one further mailgirl. "Any ideas?" he asked. They agreed that no other staff were interested. And Mitch pointed out that hiring from inside would only empty another desk that would probably not be filled.<br><br>Wendy spoke up. "Have you looked at the outsiders that we did not need when we first recruited?" That seemed like a good starting point.<br><br>Mitch pointed out the caution that would be needed with bringing in a complete outsider. "They can sign all the confidentiality agreements we can think of. But if they give one picture to the press, what can we really do?"<br><br>Belinda agreed. "If we sacked them, we would just be creating a celebrity out of their notoriety. There is absolutely no downside for an outsider to blow us up."<br><br>Shane smiled in his usual way. "May I be blunt?" he asked and getting no pushback, he continued. "What we need to hire is someone who is a little bit dim — but not too much — and who needs the money. After all, the pay is not too bad."<br><br>Belinda smiled. "So we need to somehow filter for that." Mitch chose to hope that condition did not become public. Belinda was continuing. "I have a shortlist of three, from the last recruitment. If they are still interested. I'll line up the interviews for them after hours, the same as last time. Except I would rather have Wendy outside the room this time, if that's all right with you Wendy?" Wendy agreed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Although she appeared keen over the phone, the first interviewee did not turn up. Belinda told Mitch that she had seemed the most likely but she was obviously off the list now. The second interviewee turned up but seemed confused when Belinda reminded her that she needed to interview in the nude. She eventually got the message but the body language was not anywhere near comparable to what Belinda and Mitch had seen of the first group in their interviews. They both sensed problems.<br><br>Wendy confirmed straight after that the interviewee had realised that too. "As she was leaving I thought I'd have a word with her. 'Well, I stuffed that up, didn't I?' was what she said. The three of them agreed that she had little scope to make anything publicity wise out of her experience, and she did not come across as the type that would try to do so.<br><br>The third interviewee turned up on time with the second one long gone. She marched into the interview room, up towards Belinda and Mitch oozing confidence. She wore a short, straight dress that revealed her shapely muscular legs. For effect, she swished her long blonde hair behind her ears. "I'm Pam," she rattled. "When do you want me to take my clothes off?"<br><br>Belinda sat up straight. "How about now if you're comfortable?" Mitch nodded, trying to look professional. Pam undid the buttons down the front of her dress quickly, opening it and slipping it off her shoulders facing Mitch and Belinda. With no hint of modesty, she folded it over her arm, walked over to the table along the side wall where she placed the dress and equally efficiently removed her bra and pants.<br><br>She strode back over to stand in front of Belinda and Mitch. Both could not pretend to hide their admiration for her body. She was a tall goddess, hard-bodied but curvy, breasts firm and prominent, high cheekbones and sky blue eyes.<br><br>Mitch looked to Belinda to start. "You want to be a mailgirl?" she asked the naked woman standing casually in front of them.<br><br>"You're wondering why I'm not doing anything more with a body like this?" she smiled as she gestured down her body at her obvious attributes. "I am built this way, sorry. I've tried modelling but it turns out that I have the obvious sort of figure that they don't want any more."<br><br>"So what are you doing at the moment?" Mitch asked her.<br><br>Pam shrugged. "Dishing out Maccas, mostly." She gave her interviewers a knowing look. "I'm good at getting people to order extra fries."<br><br>"What else do you do?" Belinda asked her.<br><br>"Beach, gym..." she responded vaguely.<br><br>Mitch nodded at Belinda that he felt she was right for the job. So Belinda told her the wage. "You're joking!" Pam exclaimed. Belinda then told her what her hours were. "That's amazing," she added. It seemed clear that she had not worked a regular job before. But her general good nature ruled and so she had the job when she left the room.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch got home and assumed the position and waited for his wife to come home. Jessica had messaged him earlier that the girls would not be back until late, so it was 'one of their nights.' He faced away from the entrance kneeling on the floor in the middle of their games room. He would not see anyone enter the room. But he knew that it would be Jessica. Something about the trust he had in her.<br><br>He heard Jessica come home and close the front door. Then he heard nothing. She was obviously in another part of the house, apparently taking her time. Of course how long are you waiting when you are in an unnatural position and you cannot see what time it is. One minute? Ten? Suddenly without warning, Mitch felt a hand on his back. Jessica stood behind him silently for a while. Then she stepped around him, inspecting Mitch as he stared at the floor, waiting. She tapped his erection with the tip of her finger and laughed. "That's why we don't have mailboys," she smiled. After all his erection was super hard and poking out from his body, in need of attention.<br><br>Mitch smiled.<br><br>"How was your day?" Jessica asked as she always did while she nudged his legs wider and straightened his back.<br><br>"The usual," Mitch answered casually. "Jackson teased me whenever she got the chance. She came into my office on a pretext in the morning. She sat down, spread her legs as she discussed how she was going to run a tribunal hearing. It's all distracting me from my work, maybe a little too much."<br><br>"Go on," urged Jessica, "give me the details."<br><br>Mitch knew which part of the story Jessica wanted to hear. "As she explained how she would run the tribunal — one of the stockroom boys had been inappropriate with a mailgirl, allegedly, Jackson was opening and closing her legs. And as she reminded me that the mailgirls on the tribunal would of course be nude, she took a finger, licked it and put it inside herself."<br><br>"Put it inside herself," Jessica mocked. She stiffened her mood. "Did she wank herself with it?"<br><br>Mitch sighed. "I guess you could say that she did," he conceded. In his memory, she was pumping two fingers into herself. But he was not sure if that was real or his fantasy. He had been trying to concentrate on what Jackson was telling him. Which was that he should attend the tribunal, to see how it operated and confirm whether the process worked.<br><br>"Why don't you just fuck her?" Jessica asked bluntly as she took off her clothes as if she had worked out the best possible course for her husband to follow.<br><br>"It would be like having an affair," Mitch pointed out.<br><br>"No, it would be having an affair," Jessica corrected as she lowered her underwear. She was now also completely naked.<br><br>"Right," Mitch agreed, correcting himself. "It would be having an affair."<br><br>Jessica knelt down and took him in her mouth. They had an understanding that she would relieve him first given the situation he was trapped in at work. But Mitch knew that he would have to reward her well for that concession.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"It's a bit quiet in here, isn't it sis?" Cara looked around.<br><br>Emily tried to get on her sister's wavelength. "You don't want to take anyone here into the bathroom for a few moments?" Cara looked around the bar and shook her head sadly. "No one?" Emily confirmed. She looked at her sister and then around the room again. "Not even the bar staff?"<br><br>"Not even the bar staff," Cara replied sadly. She was wondering what was wrong with her. There was usually someone.<br><br>The door to the bar opened. A middle aged man strode in, you could tell by the lines of his face and the belly that he couldn't hide that he was older than his greased back long black hair and tight jeans might initially suggest. He was alone. He surveilled the bar and not surprisingly lighted on Cara and Emily. "You wouldn't be sisters," he tried salaciously, as if he had overheard their discussion.<br><br>"What makes you think that?" Emily snapped at him.<br><br>Cara looked at her sister's unexpectedly rude riposte with amusement. "You go girl," she told her. "Are you thinking of a three in a bed romp?" Cara challenged the unfortunate libertine who was quickly realising that he was out of his depth. "With us?" she added, playing up her disbelief.<br><br>"Nice to meet you," he stammered as he backed away.<br><br>"That's it," Cara snapped at her sister, "we're getting out of here now. How much money do we have left?" Emily told her. Cara smiled with delight. "You know what that means!" she exclaimed. Emily looked at her, waiting for the punchline. "Happy ending! Let's get out of here and find a taxi."<br><br>Their Uber stopped outside Caringbush Secrets. "Do you want me to go round the back?" the driver asked automatically, apparently knowledgable about such things.<br><br>"No, this is fine," Cara decided as she opened the door to get out. A woman came out of the front door and checked her phone. She looked over at Cara and Emily getting out of the car and tapped on his window for the driver's attention. "You've got a pickup here," she asked him. He looked at his app and nodded. "That's me," she advised and got into the door that Emily had not yet closed. Emily stepped over to her sister and nudged her hard. "You're staring," she told Cara as the Uber drove off.<br><br>"I know," Cara replied. "I know her from somewhere."<br><br>"Oh I didn't look," Emily added. Her sister was still staring even though the Uber was down the street. "Are we going in?" she asked.<br><br>"It'll come to me," Cara responded absently as she headed to the front door of the massage parlour.<br><br>After pleasantries at reception, the girls followed Destinee down the passageway and into a large room. In the middle were two massage tables. Two generous lounges faced each other to the sides of the massage tables and a dresser with a large mirror faced the heads of the tables.<br><br>Destinee looked more closely at her clients as they each went to one of the lounges. "Are you two sisters?" she asked sternly.<br><br>"Yeah," Cara smirked. "People don't usually realise."<br><br>Destinee put her serious face on. "Well, no funny stuff then," she told them.<br><br>Cara nodded with her face screwed up to stop a laugh. Emily nodded more obediently as she took her clothes off. Cara put her hands on her hips as she watched her sister who was now nude as she knelt down, spread her knees and arched her back in the waiting mailgirl position. "And the other one," Cara ordered her. So Emily stood up, balanced herself on her toes, her calves tight and her hands behind her head. She was straining in that position from the moment she adopted it, but she gritted her teeth, determined to hold it.<br><br>"What is she doing?" Destinee asked Cara with a mixture of admiration and concern on her face.<br><br>"Oh that," Cara replied offhandedly, "she wants to be a mailgirl."<br><br>"I hear it pays quire well," Destinee offered. She said it in a way that suggested she knew something on the topic; it was not just an automatic retort.<br><br>"Do you know something about mailgirls?" Cara replied, picking up from her tone that Destinee did indeed know something.<br><br>Destinee seemed unfazed as she shed her robe, so she was now also nude. "Oh, the girl who was just in with me before you, she's a mailgirl. She tells me all about it."<br><br>Emily tried to act like she wasn't completely in thrall at her near proximity to a real mailgirl. "What does she tell you?" she asked evenly. Any hint of excitement was likely masked by the strained pose she was holding.<br><br>Destinee backtracked wondering if she had said too much already. "Oh nothing much, just a bit of gossip about how much she enjoys it. Apparently it can be fun being paid to be naked all day at work. Imagine," she gushed like that was all that she ever wanted. Destinee turned to Cara. "Why are you the only one in here who still has their clothes on. I'm not going to give you a happy ending if you stay like that!"<br><br>Cara admitted that it was time for her to join in and started to undress. Emily lay face down on one of the massage tables and once undressed Cara adopted the same position on the other table. Destinee started to massage Emily and then Cara. "Just a moment," she told them and stopped the massages. A few moments later, the massages started again. "I brought in a friend," Destinee whispered, "close your eyes and enjoy it."<br><br>Emily reached for Cara's hand and gripped it tightly as the sisters revelled in the pleasure as the masseurs worked on both their slits, their thighs and their bottoms. Cara looked over to her sister and smiled as her first orgasm hit her.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "Two new mailgirls are recruited then a reckoning.", 
                    content: `Jackson and Mitch found themselves facing each other in the stairwell. One of them would have to make way. Mitch was going down. Jackson who was on mailgirl duties, naked and fresh, was going up. She looked at her app and smiled. "You go."<br><br>Mitch smiled, pleased to see her. "No, you."<br><br>Jackson checked her app again. "I've got a moment. How are you?"<br><br>Her boss smiled. "I'm keeping busy. What with running the office and all that. How are things with you. Still enjoying the mailgirl life?"<br><br>Jackson smiled up at Mitch, noticing him clearly appreciating her firm breasts. "I can't say I'm not enjoying the lifestyle. Although the reason you talked me into becoming a mailgirl, the tribunal, that hasn't happened yet."<br><br>Mitch played to that. "Don't worry, it will," he responded casually. "And you say I convinced you? You made that decision totally by yourself."<br><br>Jackson tittered, her breasts jingling a little. "Do you really think so?" she challenged warmly.<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "I may have given you some urging. But I could see that you were curious."<br><br>Jackson feigned shock. "And what suggested that to you?"<br><br>"I could see it in your eyes from the start. And the more we got into the planning. I could tell you were wondering what it would be like."<br><br>Jackson put her hands on her hips. "And what else could you tell about what I wanted?"<br><br>Mitch looked confused. "What?"<br><br>Jackson sighed. "I wanted you."<br><br>"Jackson, I'm married," Mitch retorted.<br><br>Jackson smiled brightly. "Don't you worry, I'll find a way." She stepped up to Mitch pressing her naked body against his, albeit clothed one. She took one of his hands and placed it as close to her crotch as she could. "You want it too," she whispered in his ear. Then she let him go and pushed past him on her way up to her destination.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Later, Mitch stood with Shane outside Belinda Clarke's office on the ninth floor, early for their meeting about hiring the new mailgirls. Contracts had to be completed, details resolved. Shane nudged Mitch to check out over the workers in the open plan on the floor. It took Mitch a moment to realise what Shane wanted him to see. Mrs Ogawa, the visiting enforcer from head office, was working at one of the desks. Slouching at the desk next to her, the naked mailgirl Kimiko Date seemed to be in some sort of disinterested daydream. Kimiko propped her head up on the palm of her hand, balancing on her elbow as if she was keeping barely awake while she lazily kept her attention on Mrs Ogawa who had kept her for translating when she needed. Mrs Ogawa suddenly addressed the mailgirl. Having been addressed, Kimiko responded with animation, even giving her mistress a smile as she spoke, although she got no visible response from the visitor from head office in Japan, where she had status and could punish any of the Japanese mailgirls when she wanted. She neither had status or that freedom in the Melbourne office.<br><br>"Do you think Mrs Ogawa gets any pleasure from what she does?" Shane asked Mitch.<br><br>"I hope so," Mitch responded. Otherwise, what was the point?<br><br>Shane pondered for a moment. "That face never changes. Not like Mr Harada."<br><br>"Perhaps we should ask Kimiko whether Mrs Ogawa gets any enjoyment from what she does." Mitch still had visions of watching Mrs Ogawa casually mistreat Kimiko who was there to translate when he and Mrs Ogawa recently video conferenced with Mr Harada who was not only the boss of the company but, as they had recently found out, also Kimiko's grandfather.<br><br>Mitch still worried about the ramifications of his boss's granddaughter not only running naked errands in the Australian subsidiary office but also using the laxer mailgirl rules in Australia to masturbate in the office, on the other workers' desks, as well as now consenting to Mrs Ogawa disciplining her in open in the office. And further he worried about the real reason why Mrs Ogawa was on an extended visit from the Japanese head office to Melbourne. He was certain there was something to worry about there.<br><br>Shane nudged Mitch back to reality to notice that Kimiko had rocked her chair back from the desk with her spread knees and was presumably wanking herself as Mrs Ogawa spoke to her.<br><br>And at that moment, Jackson strolled into the office, naked but with intent. "Pleased to see me again?" she asked Mitch, more or less ignoring Shane. The nude mailgirl gripped Mitch gently by the shoulder and almost accidentally rubbed a nipple on his shirt which took him slightly aback. "Belinda invited me into the meeting to make sure that everything was in order," she informed the two men. Reminding them that it was a big deal that they were bringing two new mailgirls on board who were, if you ignored Jackson's complicated situation, the first outsiders to come into the company which was trying to keep its mailgirl program out of the public eye. Hiring Pam Burridge and Fanny Durack would bring the day of public intrusion into the secret world of their mailgirl operation that much closer. So much could happen. Fanny would publish her research, and Mitch was certain that Pam would intentionally or not tell someone something about their operations. Word would start to get out.<br><br>Outsiders knew that like the US and Japan operations of Harada Industries, the Melbourne office had mailgirls because Mr Harada had announced it. It was no big issue to him. There were regular videos released of the mailgirls in those two countries, and Mr Harada seemed to revel in the notoriety. The US office was now running Mailgirl courses for other US companies that wanted to introduce their own programs. While in Australia, the tight group of mailgirls, with the exception of Jackson, had all worked for the company before that fateful day when they had taken their clothes off as Mitch had announced them to the rest of the staff. They had all agreed that life was easier if as few people as possible outside the office knew what was going on.<br><br>Belinda opened the door to her office and smiled at the dressed men and the naked woman. "Sorry to have kept you," she apologised, "that phone call took longer than I hoped."<br><br>Jackson led the men into the HR boss's office wiggling her bottom at the two of them as she did, even smiling over her shoulder certain that they were watching.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson strode next to Mitch as they left the meeting. Somehow in the corridor they found themselves alone. Mitch expected another physical encounter like in the staircase when she suddenly stopped. Realising his concern, Jackson raised her hands in pretend surrender. "I've been thinking," she started, "haha, the reason you talked me into becoming a mailgirl, the tribunal, hasn't happened yet."<br><br>Relieved that was what was on the mailgirl's mind, Mitch relaxed. "Don't worry," he laughed, "be patient. And someone will stuff up."<br><br>"I have to keep my mediation skills sharp, Jackson smiled. "You never know when I might need them." she leaned against the wall, and spread one leg out.<br><br>Mitch shrugged casually. "Like riding a bike?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Like riding a bike naked, I'd say. You have to be extra careful." She looked into Mitch's face. They both knew he was looking at her body. "By the way I hear Mr Harada is coming to visit again?" she challenged.<br><br>Mitch shrugged, but more urgently. "He does what he wants." But he was concerned that Jackson knew that before he did.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mr Harada stretched expansively at the head of the board table. Mitch balanced his chin on his palm two seats away from his boss while Mr Harada's two young assistants, one male and one female, who always travelled with him sat themselves near the foot of the table and went straight to their screens, apparently to maintain contact with head office in Japan while they were in Australia. They both were dressed immaculately of course. Mitch realised that he did not know their names. Mr Harada had never introduced them. The male's black suit radiated quality tailoring, an expensive cut. His white shirt shone with freshness, its collar sharply defined. She looked impenetrable in a fitted black jacket and matching skirt that ended above her knees revealing her black lace-up fishnet stockings and a hint of bare thigh above the ties.<br><br>When Mr Harada had settled and with his assistants engrossed with the data on their screens, Mitch asked his boss what their names were.<br><br>Mr Harada ignored that and smiled at Mitch. "We are actually not unhappy with the progress in the Australian division," he announced. The male assistant suddenly spoke rapidly to Mr Harada who nodded to him and turned back to Mitch. "Can you please call a mailgirl? I have a message that I need to pass to your Personal Assistant." The male assistant hastily scrawled something down and passed it to Mr Harada who read it and nodded while Mitch summoned a mailgirl on his app. Fortunately making a good impression for Mr Harada, Pam Burridge, the new mailgirl appeared only a moment after Mitch called her.<br><br>Appearing no-nonsense she strode into the room and straight up to Mitch. The assistants stayed glued to their screens and appeared not to notice her. However Mr Harada brazenly stared at her enjoying her beauty as she walked up to the table. "Yes, Mr Johnson," she asked when she was politely close. Mitch smiled at her lapse into formality, presumably she knew who Mr Harada was. Mitch also noticed that the tall, blonde mailgirl stood waiting with her legs spread just a little making it clear that she was clean shaven.<br><br>Mitch nodded to his boss. "Mr Harada has a message to deliver to Betty Cuthbert," Mitch told her.<br><br>Mr Harada folded the notepaper in front of him and held it towards the statuesque mailgirl in such a way that she had to brush past Mitch so that she was close enough to Mr Harada that her crotch was close to his face. She affected no concerns in that situation. "Please see that Ms Cuthbert gets this message immediately," Mr Harada told her as they both held the note before he let it go. He looked up from her crotch and eventually deeply up into her large blue eyes.<br><br>"Of course," she responded and turned so that Mr Harada — and Mitch — could enjoy watching her stride out of the room, showing her firm bottom and long, shapely legs.<br><br>After she had closed the door, Mr Harada smiled at Mitch. "That is what a mailgirl should be," he told him. "Have you had her?"<br><br>Mitch looked shocked. "No, of course not."<br><br>Mr Harada gave him a curious look that Mitch could not read. Was Mr Harada testing him? Could he be literal? But Mr Harada swiftly went back to his business mode. "Can you call another mailgirl? I have a message for Mrs Ogawa." He proceeded to write something, finishing just before Fanny Durack strode in. She lost a little of her self confidence when she recognised Mr Harada and stood uncertain at the door for a moment.<br><br>"This is Fanny Durack, the other of our new mailgirls," Mitch announced, wondering if he needed to tell Mr Harada or whether he already knew. Regardless, it broke the tension and Fanny stepped forward so that she could address Mitch.<br><br>"You have a delivery for me?" she asked, trying to sound in control of her situation. Mitch realised that this was the first time that he had called her and worried for a moment about how she was handling her naked mailgirl status. He looked for any stress or fear in her face. Satisfied that she only showed a slight bewilderment, Mitch told her that the message run was for Mr Harada.<br><br>"I have read your work," Mr Harada smiled as the stiffly formal mailgirl took the message from him.<br><br>She looked at Mr Harada to check whether he was taunting her but he looked intent. "I have read some of yours," she responded.<br><br>Mitch looked quizzically at Mr Harada then checked that Fanny was not taunting him. Mr Harada smiled reassuringly at Mitch and then addressed the naked mailgirl who now seemed more relaxed. "I understand that my writings on the subject are somewhat hard to find. You have done well to locate them."<br><br>Fanny rested a hand on her bare hip. "I made it my cause to read everything on the subject. When I started there wasn't that much." Then she looked at her app. "Seems I have five minutes left to find Mrs Ogawa. Nice meeting you." And she turned giving both men clear vision of her lush bottom.<br><br>"That is not so much what a mailgirl should be," Mr Harada advised Mitch after she had left, the boardroom door closed behind her. "Where's the smart one?"<br><br>Mitch thought for a moment. "Lauryn," he realised, "she's on annual leave. She won't be back for another two weeks." Mr Harada grunted his disapproval of that. Mitch tried to pick up on their broken conversation train. "So you do not agree with our strategy of unthreatening normal mailgirls?" he asked his boss.<br><br>Mr Harada shook his head, seemingly in disbelief. "That is totally against what we are trying to promote with Harada mailgirls. A woman who is naked and on display while working in an office should be the best version of the female form that she can be. She should look striking while being submissive to the will of the office."<br><br>Mitch chose to say nothing in response to that. Mr Harada spoke sharply in Japanese in the direction of his assistants. They both looked up from their work, but the woman rose from her seat and walked around to where Mr Harada had pushed his chair back from the board table. The other assistant watched her for a moment and then went back to what he had been doing.<br><br>"Do you find this one attractive?" Mr Harada asked Mitch as he placed a hand under her chin as if showing off a prize possession. Mitch shrugged back. He wanted to stay away from that topic. Mr Harada looked into his assistant's eyes and gestured at the floor, gently forcing her down on her knees. Kneeling in front of the company boss, she unbuttoned his trousers with silent concentration. A fair size cock popped up and as she was in position, the woman took it in her mouth.<br><br>"Do you see what I mean?" Mr Harada asked Mitch as he thrust into his employee's throat.<br><br>"Is she a mailgirl?" Mitch asked on the basis that he needed to say something.<br><br>Mr Harada laughed. "She wants to be a mailgirl. But I won't let that happen. She's not quite attractive enough. She applies and I rule her as unsuitable at each intake. After testing her, of course. But she is good as a PA, she is reasonably attractive and, as you can see, quite submissive. And she is good at sex."<br><br>As Mr Harada kept thrusting into her mouth, he barked something at the other assistant who got up from his desk and stepped over behind the PA. Looking at Mr Harada, he unbuttoned his trousers and lifted her skirt. He was erect, ready to go and was soon fucking the PA from behind while Mr Harada enjoyed her mouth at the same time.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Looking down from his floor into the mailgirls' change room, Mitch noticed that Kimiko was alone. She seemed to be relaxing, but Mitch saw an opportunity and paged her to his office.<br><br>He was behind his desk pretending to work when she entered. Mitch watched Kimiko as she crossed her wrists behind her back after she closed the door to his office and stepped toe on toe towards him. The effect of tensing her arms behind her accentuated her bust and her small brown nipples pointed erect at Mitch. "I'm guessing that you don't have an errand for me," she stated flatly as she stared towards the floor.<br><br>Mitch tried empathy. "Of course not. I wanted to check on how you are dealing with your, um, grandfather back in the office. I take it that he is with Mrs Ogawa?"<br><br>"They have gone out somewhere. I wasn't needed."<br><br>"Are you okay with how she is treating you?" Mitch was thinking of her leading Kimiko by a leash through the office.<br><br>"You mean when she tied me up and kicked me around during that meeting? That was kind of fun. I'm up for new experiences, you know, and that was different and interesting. And I can deal with a little submission, if for no other reason, to find what it is like. It was a bit of a turn on." To Mitch's surprise, Kimiko kept her hands tightly behind her back while she stood in front of his desk. He of course expected that she would by now be spreading her legs to wank in front of him. Why was she holding back? Should he ask her? But they were having a relatively normal conversation so why not continue it.<br><br>"You don't have any issues with Mrs Ogawa then?" he asked.<br><br>Kimiko relaxed her posture. But she kept standing, hands by her sides. "Well, the things that she does are fun, but I don't think I'd want to do it again."<br><br>Mitch looked confused. "Why not?"<br><br>Kimiko shrugged. "Because she had her fun, I get to experience it, and it was all right. I am wondering what else she has in her arsenal. I am starting to think that she is running out of ideas."<br><br>Mitch looked seriously at the mailgirl. "You've seen the videos, if you didn't see any of it live when you were in the Japan office. She can do pretty severe discipline."<br><br>Kimiko looked equally seriously at Mitch. "I've told her that she won't be doing that. The mild stuff is all right with me. And a little bit of light tapping and teasing." As if her switch had been flicked Kimiko stepped around to the corner of Mitch's desk and perched on it so that her crotch was completely on display to him. She was close enough to run her bare leg against his trousers. "If you were to run a fingernail along my clit," Kimiko suggested, as if it was a completely normal thing to say in an office. Mitch could see her clit exposed, ready for attack, and to his astonishment, he conceded and held up his left hand.<br><br>"A fingernail," he stated, rubbing his thumb over the nail of his middle finger. Kimiko licked her lips and managed to keep her hands on her hips. Since he had really given himself no way out, Mitch felt his nail with the pad of his thumb again as he reached across as Kimiko began to heavy breathe in anticipation. Gaining back a little control, Mitch poked his finger close to Kimiko without touching her then pulled it back. The next time he anticipated Kimiko's lurch at him and touch her clit with the very tip of his finger before retracting. "Mitch!" Kimiko demanded, so he relented and gently ran the nail up and down her clit a few times before stopping to run it along each inner thigh in turn before returning to where she wanted it. After she had cum, Kimiko took his wrist in her hand and pulled him away, having done his job.<br><br>Kimiko stood back up pinching her nipples as she wended around the desk to plonk herself in one of the visitors' seats. "Mitch, you're really good at that," she gushed. "Wait until I tell Jackson!" Kimiko smiled and laughed so there was no comeback for Mitch to that.<br><br>At least it allowed Mitch to change the conversation to what he wanted. "I've been wondering about Mrs Ogawa. How well have you got to know her? Do you think that she gets off on what she does to you?"<br><br>Kimiko thought about that for a moment. "You're trying to work out what makes her tick?" Mitch nodded. "Well, she is totally dedicated to her job." Kimiko thought about that for a moment. "She doesn't seem to have any family. Just a mother, in Japan obviously. But no mention of any brothers or sisters. Or a father. She just doesn't talk about anyone. I'm pretty sure that she has no husband or relationships or children."<br><br>"So without getting too cliched about it, she may really be a company woman." Kimiko shook with concern. "What?" asked Mitch.<br><br>"I am pretty much the same when you look at it like that. Maybe I am going to become like her."<br><br>Mitch smiled. "But you've got one thing going for you."<br><br>"What?" wondered Kimiko, squirming around as her hands found their way back between her legs.<br><br>"Well, maybe I'm totally out of line — but we're constantly out of line here, so, well..." Mitch paused and composed himself. "Are you likely to be an heir?"<br><br>Kimiko straightened up with surprise. She tensed and considered that for a moment. "Mitch, I've never thought about that." She thought for a few more moments. "There's the two playboy sons. And my mother of course. But she has stayed right away from the whole company thing. The sons have children but I don't know them. I haven't seen them since I was small, and I don't remember any of them being in the Japanese office when I was there." She thought again. "Maybe I am an heiress!" She squealed. "Wouldn't that be amazing?" She waved her hands around, her breasts bouncing and spread her legs. She poked a finger right up into her vagina as she smiled at Mitch. "Me, running the company!"<br><br>Mitch shook his head with a grin as Kimiko smiled at him while she fervently got herself off. The orgasm was huge.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Fanny returned from her errand to find Pam alone in the change room. Pam twirled her long blonde hair, looking out into blank space as she languidly went through a stretching routine.<br><br>Fanny plonked herself down on the bench far enough from Pam to allow her to continue her callisthenics. "How are you finding it here?" she asked the taller one.<br><br>Pam giggled. "It's as easy as they said it would be."<br><br>"You're not worried about any future complications?"<br><br>"Complications?"<br><br>Fanny sighed, as she felt she was gaining some idea of Pam's level of insight and self-awareness. "You're not worried about what this might do for your future job prospects?"<br><br>Pam laughed. "What are prospects?" Fanny gave her a look of concern so Pam explained how mailgirl was her first real job and she could use the experience to give herself more confidence in the future looking for other work after she was finished being a mailgirl. "And what about your prospects?" she asked offhandedly.<br><br>Fanny felt that she could be candid. "I study mailgirls. This will help me directly with my future work."<br><br>Pam frowned. "I don't understand how any of that is possible, but I guess you know what you're doing. You've obviously got the brains. And I've got this." Pam gestured down her body at her shapely breasts, her tanned, flat torso and her long legs."<br><br>"Thanks for that," Fanny sniffed.<br><br>Pam suddenly realised. "Oh, I didn't mean it like that. Sure I'm blessed with this. But it's not all cruises on the bay and endless free champagne." She giggled again. "Well there's a lot of free champagne on the bay," she admitted. "But I would love to have your ability to understand things. Whatever you do."<br><br>Fanny leaned over and took one of Pam's long, manicured hands in both of hers. She looked Pam in the eye and smiled an agreement. "Let's see what we can do."<br><br>Pam smiled back. "When can we start?"<br><br>Fanny shrugged. "Whenever you like."<br><br>Pam remembered something. She thought for a moment then blurted it out. "That Betty Cuthbert is not very polite."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mr Harada stormed into Mitch's office and slammed the door. Mitch stood up from his desk, realising that Mr Harada was angry. "What's the matter?" Mitch asked him.<br><br>"This office!" Mr Harada shouted. "It shows no respect."<br><br>Something snapped in Mitch. "Are we back to this again?" he shouted. "I have told you how this office works. I've told you about this country. And I've told you about our mailgirls."<br><br>Mr Harada stared at him. "Ah, yes. You will again tell me how you have to coddle your mailgirls. That is not why you have mailgirls! You have mailgirls who sit at the bottom of the office. They are there to be used. I'll bet you don't touch your mailgirls unless they let you." Mitch shook his head in horror. Mr Harada read that and kept on. "I can't have a manager who doesn't fuck the mailgirls!"<br><br>Mitch looked incredulous. "Do you fuck the mailgirls?" he asked as much in shock as anything.<br><br>Mr Harada puffed out his chest and attempted to regain his calm self control. "What do you think? What do you think makes me look so young?" But he lost it. "Fucking the mailgirls keeps me young! Look at you! You are a flabby disgrace!" He glowered at his Australian manager.<br><br>Mitch was not flabby. "I don't know if I want to be like you," he stated.<br><br>Mr Harada smiled like he knew things that Mitch didn't. "Maybe you are already but you don't yet know it?"<br><br>Mitch got defensive at the thought. "This is not what it's about!" he shouted back.<br><br>Mr Harada crossed his arms. "This is exactly what it's about. Why do you think we have naked women wandering around the office? There has to be some reward for the male libido, for the man's urges, to reward him for doing this." He gestured at Mitch's desk and the office generally with a wide sweep of his arms.<br><br>Mitched crossed his arms and regained his cool. "But that is not what it about here," he reminded Mr Harada. "The arrangement is for the mailgirls' satisfaction, not the workers. That's how we got it through the rules and regulations."<br><br>Mr Harada smiled condescendingly, again hinting that he knew things that Mitch did not. "And you think that is how it is really working?" he challenged.<br><br>Mitch evidently missed the nuance. "I know. I work here. This is what I see." He was quite certain.<br><br>Mr Harada shook his head. "You don't see everything. I'm telling you this is how we need to reward the men who make my business a success. And your mailgirls understand this."<br><br>"I don't believe you," Mitch snapped back.<br><br>Mr Harada kept his crossed. "Very well then. Let's bring your psychologist in. Let's see what she says. I understand that she has been studying mailgirls around the world. She will tell you what really goes on."<br><br>Mitch gave Mr Harada a dare-you look. "You think I am out of touch? I know everything that goes on in this office and I know a lot of things that you do not know. But maybe that later. For the moment, let us speak with Miss Fanny Durack about this matter you are so ardent on, the issue of sexual satisfaction."<br><br>"Right!" agreed Mr Harada who then stormed out of Mitch's office.<br><br>Betty Cuthbert stepped in through his open door. She looked over to Mitch: "Well," she observed, "it sounded like that went well. Do we still have jobs?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"Pam Burridge!" a man called out in Swanston Street. People looked around to see what the disturbance was. But Pam Burridge stopped to find the identity of the man who had called her name. He called her name again, not so loud this time, from not far behind her. She turned to see if she knew him, her summer dress showing off her long bare legs to good effect. He looked from her legs to her face as she tried to recall him, mid-twenties, neat in a button-up shirt and chinos, with a smile for her. Pam looked at him but with no recognition. But she had stopped so he walked up to her. "Ian," he announced. "I was an assistant on the photo shoot at the St Kilda Pier. Ian Baker."<br><br>Pam still looked quizzical. "Which one?" she queried.<br><br>Ian thought for a moment. "Bright colours, dresses. It was a windy day would you believe, so you got to show plenty of leg, a lot more than you probably intended." Pam smiled at the irony of that given her current employment and the view she provided there in the street. "Word is," Ian continued, "that you have disappeared. You were just about to breakthrough big time. And then Harold Holt."<br><br>"Whoever that is." She smiled and swished back her long blonde hair.<br><br>Ian soaked that up. "Whatever, nobody knew where you had got to, you completely disappeared. There are all sorts of stories, most of them involving religious cults. But here you are! Looking magnificent. What are you doing?"<br><br>"I joined a religious cult," Pam smirked. She struck a pose, dropping a shoulder back, like in the before times, just to show him. Her bust jutted out. Passers-by gave her a quick look to see what she was up to. Ian found himself admiring her more. But his look asked for more. "I got myself a job," Pam answered carefully.<br><br>"Not modelling?"<br><br>"Well, sort of." She knew that she was not a good liar.<br><br>"But not with anyone I know in the business. Come on, spill the beans."<br><br>Pam frowned as she tried to work out what to say, knowing the office's aversion to publicity. She opened her mouth but said nothing.<br><br>"Don't tell me you're a..." Ian tried to look concerned. But he was also somewhat excited at the prospect.<br><br>Pam immediately caught on to what he was thinking. "No, absolutely nothing like that!" she exploded.<br><br>Ian grinned as he rolled through the possibilities. He landed on one. "No," he exclaimed. "You're not one of them!" Pam waited to let him explain his thoughts. "A mail thingie?" Surprised, Pam looked abashed, down at the footpath. "I don't believe it! We were all starting to think that they did not actually exist. You have to tell me everything."<br><br>"Actually," Pam tried, "I have to get back to the office. My lunch break is almost over and I, um, have to pick up some things for the others."<br><br>"That is amazing," Ian continued, now animated. "There are others. You have to introduce us."<br><br>"Um, they're very private. I don't think that's going to happen." Pam backed away from Ian indicating that she really had to leave.<br><br>But Ian was too excited. He strode back up to her, trying to look as appreciatively unthreatening as he could. "How do I get a job there?"<br><br>Pam crossed her arms. "You apply," she smirked. "But they're not hiring." And this time she strode off. She could sense Ian Baker watching her back and her bottom and thinking about her in uniform. She knew the dress hugged her hips and exaggerated her figure as she strode away. She wondered if there would be repercussions. And then decided not to bother. So what if people knew? It was a bit like modelling, and well, she had always used her body to pay her way.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Fanny Durack strode into the boardroom to find Mitch and Mr Harada waiting for her. She put her laptop on the table and sat facing them.<br><br>Mr Harada decided to break the ice. "Is being a mailgirl what you expected it to be?" he smiled. And added "but of course you had data and interviews to give yourself an expectation of what it would be like."<br><br>"That's true," Fanny agreed. She sat back as her large breasts dominated both men's view of her. She knew. "But you're not here just to stare at the girls," she smiled, rolling her shoulders back just a little to magnify the situation. "You're also interested in my research."<br><br>Mitch nodded. Mr Harada did not seem fussed. "It goes without saying," he started, "that not every attractive young woman would want to be a mailgirl. And that not every young woman who becomes a mailgirl will find that it is the course for her. We would like to use your research to have fewer mistakes in the future."<br><br>Fanny perked up at that. "There have been mistakes?" she asked.<br><br>Mitch looked to Mr Harada with concern. Mr Harada did not look flustered at all. "I thought that you knew."<br><br>Fanny laughed. "You would like to think I know everything?"<br><br>Mr Harada smiled back at her. "Your research is quite comprehensive. I assumed that you have very good sources."<br><br>"I won't disappoint you by telling you what I wanted to know that I couldn't find. And you obviously know things that I don't. My interest was in the mailgirls' transition from clothed to naked, how they coped with that, what effect it had on their outside life and, as I am sure you are aware, on their sex lives too. Because we would be deluding ourselves if we pretended this is not about sex in the office."<br><br>Mr Harada turned to Mitch. "See, I told you it was about sex. The researcher agrees it is all about sex." He looked to the mailgirl who sat watching both him and Mitch. "Go on," Mr Harada urged her. Mitch placed his chin on his palm and attempted to keep a poker face.<br><br>"There is a range of sexual interactions that differ subtly between the three offices. In Japan the mailgirls display more overt submission. This may be cultural. But it also may be due to your attitudes, Mr Harada which are reflected in the staff you select..."<br><br>"...like Mrs Ogawa..."<br><br>"...like Mrs Ogawa. As well as the type of women who you recruit to be mailgirls in Japan. Some of your recruitment processes identify the more assertive women, ones who may stand up to Mrs Owaga or make scenes about their treatment in the office. You avoid them and end up with the women who are happy to be this." And Fanny Durack waved her arm at the prints on the walls of the boardroom. Both Mr Harada and Mitch nodded.<br><br>"You see?" Mr Harada asked Mitch who tried to not respond. Sensing that as a victory, Mr Harada turned back to Fanny Durack. "And what about the US? He asked.<br><br>"Now that is interesting," Fanny started. "You have a number of women in senior management positions there. So I am naturally interested in their attitudes to the mailgirls. Men in charge — either in Japan or here in Australia — are going to inevitably adopt traditional attitudes to having naked women in the office. The women are seen as objects until the time when they are not."<br><br>"Guilty," Mitch admitted. "I ignored Lauryn's work on renewables until it was thrust on me by circumstances."<br><br>"Whether or not we have clothes on," Fanny smiled. She puffed out her impressive chest. "I have to keep checking whether you are paying attention to me or my breasts," and she cupped both of her breasts up in the general direction of the men she was addressing. "But at least with my clothes off it's pretty obvious." She toyed with her nipples for a moment and then pushed back her chair and gave her slit a flick. Putting her hands back on the board table Fanny smiled at them. "Now where was I?" she teased. "Oh yes, my study into how female managers treat their naked mailgirls." She looked to the men but they were clearly paying attention to her words, not intending to interrupt. Fanny referred to her laptop, opened a document and read from it. "Where male managers in Japan and Australia see mailgirls as objects and therefore tend to dismiss them as anything other than bodies to enjoy, either by viewing them or punishing them or otherwise stimulating them, the female managers in the US see the presence of naked women in the office both as examples of degradation and therefore beneath their contempt while at the same time they see them as threats." Fanny looked at the men and paused for effect. She went back to her notes on the laptop. "Therefore their attitude towards the mailgirls is equally complicated. They are harsher with them. But they also take the time to play elaborate games with them, hoping to entrap them as if to make the mailgirls admit to their degraded status to give the female managers some validation of their status. And to differentiate the women who are in their office to merely be objects whereas the managers have status and power in the office structure." She looked up again. "Sorry, I'm getting a bit theoretical."<br><br>Mr Harada smiled. "No, that all makes sense to me," he agreed. "And there's a lot there that I had not thought of."<br><br>Fanny looked to Mitch who said nothing, then back to Mr Harada who was waiting on her to continue, so she did. "One US manager in particular, a Lindsay Davenport was very open with me when I interviewed her about how she likes to trap her mailgirls in webs created from their own mishaps, their debt situation, their health cover, etc. It's an elaborate sexual game. But it was hard to work out as an outsider who was getting off on it and why. I asked her in the interview, but she fobbed me off with a response that really didn't answer the question. I guess there is an element of satisfaction on both sides, at least I hope that the mailgirls in the US are the personality types who enjoy that sort of treatment. And I guess that Lindsay Davenport wouldn't do it unless she gets something out of it."<br><br>Mr H smiled mysteriously. "You know that she's only a Vice President, don't you?"<br><br>"Maybe it's just a power trip?" Mitch wondered. But neither of the other two gave him anything that could give him any validation for that observation.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Sauntering back into the change room on the mezzanine, Pam found five mailgirls who had clearly been waiting for her to bring back their lunch orders. Well, four of them came over eager to get started on their meals. Kimiko sat against the far wall, engrossed in something on her screen. Lauryn and Annette were away.<br><br>Finding herself surrounded by four naked women, Pam chose to play up to them. "Shouldn't I get undressed and get ready first?" she asked them.<br><br>Heather played that straight. "There's plenty of time for that when we're starving," she warned.<br><br>Pam wasn't done yet as she waved the bag with their food away from the four of them. "There are plenty of snacks around in the office, that I've seen," she pointed out.<br><br>This time, Jan took her on. "We're not giving in to that sort of temptation. We have our appearance to consider."<br><br>"Yeah," agreed Heather who managed to wobble her decent bust and comfortable belly at Pam.<br><br>"Okay then," Pam conceded and placed the bag down on the bench so that she could distribute the meals correctly. Having only one left, she walked up to disturb Kimiko. When she called her name, Kimiko looked up first of blankly having been disturbed. But then she smiled genially.<br><br>"Thanks," Kimiko gushed as Pam handed her meal to her. "You look great by the way."<br><br>The others were already eating. Heather attracted her attention again. "Hey Pam!" she called out. Pam looked over. "Time to get dressed!" she called. Pam shook her head while the others laughed. The dress came over her head revealing that all Pam had on underneath was a sports bra. That was soon off too. She knew her bust needed some covering when she was in the street.<br><br>"Clear down below, nice," Heather observed. Fanny seemed to look shocked at how Pam had been dressed outside the building. Pam widened her eyes at Fanny, hands on hips to dare her to say anything. Fanny gave up and shook her head.<br><br>"Way to go," Jackson offered semi-seriously as if there was some deep wisdom about their whole situation.<br><br>"I don't have strap marks do I?" Pam called out generally.<br><br>"Come over and let me look," Jan insisted. Pam did so and let her nude colleague run her hands over her shoulders and down her back. After her close examination, Jan confirmed there were no visible marks, to Pam's relief.<br><br>"Check her panty line," Heather suggested.<br><br>Pam shook her head at Heather, but something from their interaction reminded her of the encounter with Ian. Jackson saw the look on her face and gestured her away from the others so they could talk discretely.<br><br>"I ran into someone," Pam admitted to Jackson.<br><br>Jackson played it light. "With your clothes on."<br><br>Pam looked apprehensive. "Well yeah." Jackson put a reassuring hand on her arm. Pam recoiled from that. "I'm not like that," she exclaimed.<br><br>Jackson appeared confused. "Like what?"<br><br>Pam faltered a little but continued regardless. "One of those."<br><br>Jackson wondered at that. "We all happen to like men, don't worry."<br><br>Pam tried to express what she was thinking. "It's just that I'm not used to. You know, being around naked girls. All the touching? Do you?"<br><br>Jackson laughed. "Not until I started here doing this no. But no pressure. Although you do know how to use the dildo stations?"<br><br>Pam pulled a face. "I think I get the idea. I know what to do if I get the need."<br><br>"Okay, we look after each other," Jackson offered, intentionally oblique, thinking she was on Pam Burridge's wavelength. "Now this encounter. Any awkwardness?"<br><br>Pam looked down at the floor. "I think he worked out what I'm doing."<br><br>"So that could be awkward?" Jackson considered.<br><br>"I know what I was supposed to say. What I was told in training. And I tried. But like he could see right through me. And I'm a terrible liar, so I wasn't going to try to tell him anything that would have forced me to say too much."<br><br>Jackson went to put her reassuring hand on Pam's and then stopped after the warning. "I'm sure that you did the right thing. And don't worry, there are certain people who want more publicity for the program, so they won't be too upset if it becomes public."<br><br>"What do you tell people?" Pam asked.<br><br>Jackson smiled at the thought of the discussions that she had had with her friends. "I tell them that it's a top secret assignment. But then I have the advantage that it was sometimes the case in my fabric days, that I could not tell people what I was doing. So I try to pass it off as just another one of those."<br><br>"Are you proud or not proud of what you are doing?"<br><br>Jackson thought for a moment. "That's a good question," she stalled. "And I don't know that I can give you an answer, I really don't know."<br><br>"So how did you agree to do it?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "It was like momentum. I seemed to find myself agreeing to try it out, as if it was an obvious progression for me. And then I was taking my clothes off in front of all the office staff. And here we are."<br><br>Pam's app buzzed. She looked at it. "It appears that I am wanted in the boardroom." Jackson shared a smile with Pam as she left the sanctuary of the change room.<br><br>Jan waited until Pam was well gone then went over to Jackson. "Do you think she'll be all right?"<br><br>Jackson nodded. "I think she can look after herself."<br><br>"But there's something," Jan noted.<br><br>Jackson nodded again. "There's definitely something. I don't know what." But she was wondering what being outed publicly as a mailgirl would mean for her. Was it no longer a game? Should she be worried? Her app beeped. She was wanted in HR.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Pam opened the door to the boardroom to find Mr Harada alone there. "You are Pam Burridge, the new mailgirl," he stated as she walked in. Realising that it was just the two of them she stopped just inside the doorway.<br><br>"I am," she said.<br><br>"And you know that I am the boss of the company." He smiled as he stood and quickly got between Pam and the door, closing it. "And the owner," he added with a smile.<br><br>"I had heard rumours," Pam replied, noting how close Mr Harada was to her, just about invading her personal space. She stood up straight, just a little taller than he was.<br><br>He laughed, breathing on her as he did. "You Aussie girls are so funny," he recited.<br><br>"We are?" Pam asked like it had not occurred to her.<br><br>"Would you enjoy having sex with me?" Mr Harada asked her, trying to look her in the eyes. Which meant that he had to look up at her.<br><br>Pam avoided the eye contact. "I think not," she stated blandly but firmly.<br><br>Mr Harada backed away from the naked mailgirl which at least meant that she was again closer to the door than he was. "Is there a reason?" he asked like he was being reasonable. "I am fit and healthy and I think you would enjoy having me inside you." He pointed at his crotch. Although he was dressed, it was clear from the bulge that he was ready to fuck. "And you are a very attractive addition to our program." Mr Harada made no secret of ogling her while he adjusted his erection inside his pants.<br><br>Pam shook her head and decided to be direct rather than rude. "I'm sorry but I don't have sex. It has never interested me, ever. And I don't see the point." She watched Mr Harada closely, waiting for his reaction. She had been in this situation with enamoured men before but always when trapped with them before, she had some clothes on.<br><br>Mr Harada smiled to allow her to relax. "Well, that is different. I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable. Despite all the trappings, everything about our mailgirls is consensual. You see these pictures?" Mr Harada gestured at the walls of the boardroom and the large prints of the bound women. Pam glanced and nodded, so he continued. "This all happened in my office in Tokyo. All the women consented before we started."<br><br>Pam stood for a moment thinking. Then she sat down on the nearest chair and put her elbows on the board table. "Can you be certain of that?" she asked, this time making eye contact. "You are aware that you have the money and the power. How sure are you that these women were not coerced either overtly or otherwise?"<br><br>Mr Harada remained standing and seemed happy to get the question. "We made it an open invitation. The women applied because they wanted to do it. Mrs Ogawa knows where to advertise. But I can accept that there are inequalities in the nature of the economic system that I can do nothing about."<br><br>"Except to perpetuate."<br><br>"Indeed, I am guilty." Mr Harada wondered that he felt no anger at this turn of events. "I have seen your work history. May I ask where you picked up these values?" He hoped he sounded inquisitive and not condescending. It seemed to work.<br><br>Pam smiled, back to her sardonic self. "You are referring to my work modelling clothes and revealing my body? As a model I had plenty of time just hanging around, waiting, to improve my mind. And some good teachers. Plus in that industry you have to learn to set boundaries, protect your brand and know where you stand. I know how to sell a dream. But the dream is in your mind, not mine. I may look like this..." Pam flicked back her long hair and gave Mr Harada a seductive smile, even slightly thrusting her bare breasts towards him. "...but I read the entire mailgirl contract and I liked the protections it offered."<br><br>"And you know the mailgirls in Japan and the United States do not have your conditions."<br><br>"But as you told me, it is still consensual for them, right?"<br><br>"There are grey areas. The girls who apply there know that they are giving up some of their control if they are accepted. We make the rules and the conditions clear to them. So that attracts a certain sort of person."<br><br>"And if an Australian mailgirl meets a Japanese one?"<br><br>Pam smiled. Then they both laughed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The CEO of BAD Solutions was trying to explain the need for an outage of the mailgirls app to Mitch who sat relaxed in one of the IT company's breakout areas on level 3 enjoying the product of their top line cappuccino machine. The CEO gestured behind Mitch so he turned around to see Jackson looking quite serious.<br><br>"We haven't seen her down here before," the CEO said, impressed. "But she looks like she means business."<br><br>Jackson kept her distance from the meeting but loudly enough beckoned "Mitch, can I have a word" for him to excuse himself and go over to speak privately to her. "Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation. How soon can you get up to HR?"<br><br>"Just give me a few moments to tie this up," Mitch suggested.<br><br>"I'll meet you up there," Jackson thanked him and scooted off oblivious to the BAD Solutions CEO's leer, back to the stairs.<br><br>"She looks like a good one," he tried, not wanting of course to seem too lecherous despite obviously having enjoyed the view.<br><br>Mitch wondered that he felt somewhat possessive about Jackson and hoped that he did not show it. "I have an issue upstairs," he explained. "But we do need to get back to this later." He was pleased to escape. When they resumed he could bring someone from IT back with him to ensure he was not being snowed. He thought of bringing Jan back down. Given that she was a triple threat being attractively blonde and tall, a mailgirl and from the IT department before she undressed.<br><br>But he had to scoot to HR. Waiting in Belinda Clark's office with her were Jackson and a somewhat distressed Heather McKay.<br><br>Mitch looked at Heather. "Jackson said it was serious, Heather?"<br><br>Heather being her straightforward self went right to the point. "He touched me. I was walking past. I can't say whether it was deliberate. But it was here." She placed her hand just below her breast.<br><br>"It's possible that he tried to make it look like an accident," Jackson added.<br><br>Mitch looked to Belinda who clearly wanted him to lead. "Do you want to take it to the tribunal, or is it something more serious?" he asked Heather.<br><br>"Would the tribunal fix it?" Heather asked generally of the room.<br><br>Mitch looked to Belinda and Jackson for that answer. Belinda looked to Jackson. "I think this is the sort of thing that the tribunal can handle if Heather wants it to," Jackson answered. "It should be more of a resolution than a punishment. Sort of to deter..." Jackson trailed off. "What's his name?" she asked Heather.<br><br>"Peter Parker, from the stock room," Heather reported.<br><br>Belinda spoke up. "I'm sorry to ask, but is there any history with him?" she asked Heather.<br><br>Heather shrugged. "He's no better or worse than the rest of the boys in there."<br><br>"And this is a step too far out of line," Belinda concluded. "It was disrespectful. And unwanted."<br><br>"I think so," Heather agreed, "yes." She looked around. "What happens from here?"<br><br>They all looked to Jackson. "We're supposed to convene a panel of three. But I'm wondering if that is too many, three of us facing him. So maybe just me? And I'll try to convene it as soon as possible."<br><br>"Will he be punished?" Heather asked with an air of uncertainty.<br><br>"Not by the tribunal," Jackson advised. "But if he doesn't take the tribunal seriously..."<br><br>Mitch burst in. "I'll be attending, observing. The tribunal will make it clear that if the three of you cannot resolve it then I can take it on as a formal complaint."<br><br>Heather nodded. "I think that's what I want," she added.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Peter Parker was the last person to enter the HR meeting room which was now a little crowded. As well as Heather who stood near the back of the room, Jackson, Belinda Clarke and Mitch were seated at the meeting room table. Belinda invited Peter to take a seat and when he sat at the place closest to the door, Heather sat in the seat furtherest away from him. Of course she and Jackson were naked, their breasts visible above the level of the table. Belinda thanked Peter for coming and looked to Jackson.<br><br>"I think we all know why we are here," Jackson started. "We are going with just me as the tribunal. In this case, I think that having three mailgirls staring at you would seem like intimidation." Peter seemed to be disinterested in that, so Jackson proceeded. "The aim here is to see if we can agree that the event concerned occurred and then have a discussion about the effects of the event and see what can be done in the future to ensure that everyone can continue to work here knowing what behaviour is expected of them and where peoples' limits are." Jackson stopped, realising that Peter was staring away at a side wall of the room. "Peter," she asked loudly, "are you paying attention?"<br><br>He looked at first of all Mitch, then Belinda and then in the direction of Jackson. But he looked contrite. "I don't know where to look," he admitted.<br><br>"You can look at me," Jackson smiled.<br><br>"But you're..."<br><br>"Naked, yes. You are allowed to look at mailgirls. We don't mind it." Jackson sat back and straightened which meant that her firm breasts looked more prominent than before.<br><br>"So you don't mind if I stare at your bossoms," Peter faltered.<br><br>Jackson laughed. "No one knew I had them until I took my clothes off." She smiled over at Mitch who pretended not to be affected.<br><br>"You're not going to punish me?" Peter asked.<br><br>"No, that's not how this works. We try to resolve issues like this without anything like punishment."<br><br>Peter felt he had gained some power. "So it's all touchy feely and love dovey," he sneered.<br><br>Jackson displayed calm. "No, it's designed as an informal discussion with some suggestions at the end to keep this issue out of the formal HR grievance process which, if you're not aware, could have an adverse effect on your work opportunities going forward, depending on the outcome."<br><br>Peter shrunk back in his seat, his defiance extinguished. "Can I have some time to think about it?"<br><br>"Sure," Jackson allowed. "How long do you think you will need?<br><br>"I dunno. A few days. Just to get things straight in my mind."<br><br>"Certainly. Tell Belinda when you are ready and we will reconvene when you are ready." Jackson nodded at Belinda who shrugged her compliance. She looked over to Heather who affected to not be concerned about the proceedings. Everyone shuffled ready to leave the room for their regular work.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>With the tribunal over, Mitch went back to his office. He closed the door behind him. But to his surprise, Jackson came straight in after him, closing the door firmly behind her. He sensed some heightened assertiveness in the naked mailgirl, something in her attitude that he could not quite identify. Still he treated her as he always did, with a smile and an attitude that said she was always welcome around him. Jackson sat down in one of the chairs facing Mitch and hooked one leg over an armrest to expose herself totally to him.<br><br>"I think that went pretty well," Mitch suggested.<br><br>"As expected," Jackson smirked.<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"I think he understands the effects of what he did and he is trying to work out the best way to resolve it all with the least ramifications for him."<br><br>Mitch tried to look perturbed. "Are you suggesting that he didn't think it was serious?"<br><br>"I guess time will tell. There's always that fear that he might continue down the path he is on if he thinks the worst that will happen to him is a polite chat involving at least a couple of naked mailgirls."<br><br>Mitch considered that for a moment. "I guess we'll just have to see how things go when we reconvene and keep alert for any hints as to whether he is trying to be clever about things."<br><br>"Indeed," Jackson agreed. "I'll have a think about that, maybe more clearly define where the line should be drawn. So that he knows how close he is to having it handed over to HR for serious consideration."<br><br>"And we have to think about the effect of the transgression on the victim," Mitch suggested.<br><br>"Speaking of transgression..." Jackson started. She played with her nipples as she smiled dangerously at Mitch. "What you did to Kimiko."<br><br>"What I did to Kimiko," Mitch repeated slowly.<br><br>Jackson help up a hand at Mitch. And ran the pad of the index finger of her other hand across the top of the nail of her middle finger. Mitch smiled at her like it was no big deal. Jackson crossed her arms across her chest. "I have cause to be insulted." Mitch looked confused. "Mitch, I'm your office wife." Jackson looked seriously put out by the Kimiko event.<br><br>"What even is an office wife?" Mitch asked, seemingly truly confused.<br><br>Jackson got more assertive. "I think it's pretty self explanatory, Mitch." She sat back with arms wide and legs spread to indicate how naked she was. "I think you need to do something more for me than merely what you did for Kimiko.<br><br>Mitch thought he would be clever. "That wasn't 'mere' I'd say," he retorted.<br><br>Jackson smiled darkly. "I think you're digging yourself into a deeper hole."<br><br>Mitch tried to look remorseful. "I'm sorry if I didn't think of you that way. I do have an actual wife."<br><br>"Outside this building," Jackson reminded him. "But inside here, there's this." She got out of her seat and pressed her breasts in Mitch's direction. "And there's this." Jackson inserted a finger inside her vagina as she stepped around to Mitch's side of the desk, standing over him while she gently wanked herself. She pressed a breast down against Mitch's shoulder. "And there's this," she added as she rubbed a nipple against the thin cotton of his shirt. Neither of them was in any doubt that Mitch could feel Jackson stimulate herself against him.<br><br>"So what can I do to repair things with my office wife then?" Mitch asked, hoping for a way to get out of the situation.<br><br>But Jackson smiled, ready. "This," she exclaimed, pushing Mitch's chair back a bit so that she could prop on his desk, facing him, her legs spread and her feet on his thighs. Before Mitch could consider any defensive action, Jackson grabbed his hand and placed the nail of his middle finger on her clit.<br><br>"Let's see what you did with Kimiko but wouldn't do with me," she gushed as she pushed her clit just enough against Mitch's nail to confirm what was expected of him. Jackson let go of his hand to balance herself better on Mitch's desk as he slowly scraped his finger down her clit. Since Jackson's clit seemed much smaller than Kimiko's, Mitch chose to run his nail around her inner labia and then just inside the opening to her vagina before returning to her now engorged clit that he could now pattern his nail across. He make a circle, he made an X and then getting a gasp from Jackson, Mitch concentrated on a tiny spot in the centre. Jackson thrust up at Mitch's finger and then she stuffed two fingers into her cunt to give her the best chance of getting off. Which all of a sudden she did, convulsing for a long moment as Mitch concentrated on giving her clit maximum stimulation. She came down quickly and reached forward to give Mitch a passionate kiss which, again taken by surprise, he returned with equal fervour, his hand pressed against her slit by the weight of her body. Mitch gave in to his passion for the mailgirl. They kept kissing.<br><br>Then Mitch heard his door open. And the unmistakable voice of Shane. "I'll come back when you're not so busy," he flatly observed as he firmly and loudly closed the door behind him. Instinctively, Mitch pulled himself back from a smiling Jackson.<br><br>"That," she laughed, "is what an office husband does." She stood up and shook some stiffness out of her body. Feeling supple again, she leaned forward and gave Mitch another kiss.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jessica waved the twins out the front door with the usual warnings and watched them drive off in their Uber. "Dinner's almost ready," she shouted out to Mitch, wherever he was in the house. Being Mitch, she found him in the kitchen checking on what was in the oven.<br><br>"Leave the food to me," she ordered, "you're on wine duty."<br><br>With dinner served and a half full wineglass in her hand, Jessica looked across the table at Mitch. "You've been up to something at work this week. I can tell." She stared hard at her husband. "Will I like it?"<br><br>Mitch took a sip of his wine while he thought about the question. "Ah, so that's why you got rid of the girls for the night. Am I that transparent?" He wondered at the effect of the boyish grin he tried on Jessica.<br><br>"Yes," she answered without malice.<br><br>"Yes, something happened," Mitch admitted. "I was going to tell you."<br><br>"But you were waiting for the right moment?"<br><br>"It's never the right time is it?" Mitch smiled. "I promise to tell you after dinner." He complimented Jessica who chose to be a bit distant. "But other things have happened," he offered. Jessica looked at him silently, so Mitch continued. "I think it's going to be out in the public soon."<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"One of the new mailgirls was found out. And of course Mr Harada wants it that way."<br><br>"Will it change things?"<br><br>"Well I will forever be the boss of the naked mailgirls, so that could be a bit limiting."<br><br>"A bad career move?"<br><br>"No career move."<br><br>"We could survive. Well, more that survive."<br><br>"True. Although I wonder what it will be like to be known as the ex-boss of the mailgirls."<br><br>"You like it though, don't you?"<br><br>"I've admitted to you before, I have no complaints about managing a group of naked women in the office."<br><br>"All those sacrifices were worth it." They both laughed.<br><br>The dishes cleared and wineglasses refilled, Jessica looked hard at her husband. "Okay, spill it," she ordered.<br><br>Mitch looked his normal confident self, then lost a little of his lustre as he assembled the words. "Um, Jackson got me to stimulate her," he admitted.<br><br>Jessica encouraged Mitch to continue. "Oh really, stimulate? And pray tell, how did you do that?"<br><br>"Well, she found out what I had to do to Kimiko."<br><br>"Had to do," Jessica repeated slowly. "You could have said no," she pointed out.<br><br>"Well it sort of happened. Mailgirl rules. They can require us to get them off. I'm sure that I told you. There are penalties for refusing them."<br><br>"How convenient. I'm sure that it just happened as you said," Jessica suggested, of course hinting that Mitch may have omitted something. "You are going to have to describe the nature of this stimulation. And I guess we had better establish how many of your mailgirls this stimulation extends to. More than two?"<br><br>"We are not allowed to get pleasure ourselves. Well, not visibly, if you know what I mean."<br><br>"Well, I do not know exactly what you mean, but I guess I can be grateful for that. Now how many mailgirls?"<br><br>"Just the two. Only Kimiko and Jackson."<br><br>"I am pleased to hear this tale from the office. Although I always expected that it would be matter of time. Now details, I want details." Mitch began to explain how Kimiko had demanded he use his fingernail on her clit. "And where was she when you performed this altruistic act?" Mitch explained how she perched herself on the corner of his desk. "And Jackson adopted the same position?" Jessica confirmed as she started to remove her clothes. "It certainly sounds stimulating," she continued, as she stepped out of her pants and stood naked, smiling. "I can imagine how being naked and exposed in your office could be a turn-on even before compelling the boss to play with your exposed clit." Jessica stepped around to the corner of the table near Mitch, planting her bottom down and spreading her legs. "Like this?" she asked hoarsely, right up close to Mitch's face.<br><br>"Pretty much," he agreed.<br><br>"Well you can guess what you have to do now," Jessica smiled. "Or is that only for the office?" Mitch reached down and scratched a fingernail down one of his wife's thighs, from right near her crotch down towards her knee. And then he ran his finger along her other inner thigh before moving his finger closer to her clit.<br><br>"This is how I run the office," Mitch smiled at his wife, as he scratched as close to her clit as was possible without touching it.<br><br>Jessica gasped and thrust a little. She quickly regained her calm. "Based on what you said, you have to keep your clothes on and I'll be the mailgirl," she ordered.<br><br>"I guess so," Mitch agreed as he ran his nail over Jessica's suddenly very visible clit."<br><br>"Yes, yes!" urged Jessica, panting. "I can see why they wanted this." She pushed back from Mitch's finger for a moment of relief. Her breathing soon came back down to normal. She smiled at her husband. "Are you getting an erection?" Mitch nodded, his finger poised for him to continue when Jessica was ready for more. She grinned. "And there's nothing you can do about it?" she pressed. And then gestured for Mitch to continue.<br><br>Mitch carefully prodded his wife's spread pussy. "I cannot do anything about it unless the mailgirl tells me I am allowed to," he admitted.<br><br>Jessica undulated under her husband's efforts. "And did you get hard with Kimiko?" she asked. Mitch shook his head. "With Jackson?"<br><br>"No," Mitch insisted.<br><br>Jessica was into a rhythm with her hips requiring Mitch to concentrate to keep the right pressure on her. "I find that hard to believe," Jessica gasped. "Hard," she repeated for the obvious point.<br><br>Mitch tried to look cute. "It's the truth," he argued, "only you turn me on."<br><br>Jessica lurched forward. "So noble!" she cried out. And added with more control "that better be the case."<br><br>Mitch smirked. "I was concentrating on what I was doing to them, I wasn't thinking of myself. Only their pleasure."<br><br>Jessica gave a sharp laugh. "And that's why they put you in charge of the office!" And she came.<br><br>After she came back down, Jessica went to sit, still naked back in her seat at the dinner table facing Mitch and took a sip of her wine. "I can see why Kimiko got Jackson to get you to do it to her. It's quite a technique. I think we'll have to try it again soon."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "All I ever do is give orgasms to you women!"<br><br>"That's my boy."<br><br>"So you're not upset?"<br><br>"I've had to live with the possibilities of this mailgirl thing. So long as what has to happen in the office stays in the office."<br><br>Mitch wondered where it all could end up. But he felt pleased that he had avoided using Jackson's term 'office wife'. Despite Jessica's assurances that she accepted his entanglement in the mailgirl program, he was still worried that he was putting strains on the marriage because of it.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Cara and Emily sat facing each other at the restaurant. "Tell me you'll join us," Emily pleaded.<br><br>"Explain it to me again," Cara asked calmly.<br><br>"We're doing a performance. We have the room booked, one night only. We set it up as an office..." Emily looked at her sister hopefully.<br><br>"...an office with mailgirls no doubt..." Cara stated, lifting a piece of broccoli from her plate, examining it on the end of her fork.<br><br>"Exactly," Emily exclaimed. "Tell me you'll come," she pleaded.<br><br>"Of course I'll be there," Cara measured. "I wouldn't miss it."<br><br>"That's not what I meant." Emily pouted.<br><br>"Well, what did you mean?" Cara smiled.<br><br>"Do I have to spell it out?"<br><br>"You're the mailgirl in the family..." Cara suggested and swallowed the broccoli. Emily jiggled in her sheer linen vest, making it clear that she was not wearing anything more above her bare navel.<br><br>"And talking about mailgirls..." Emily continued.<br><br>"Do we talk about anything else?" Cara asked, chewing her vegetables.<br><br>"Have you thought about who the mailgirl from Caringbush Secrets could be?" Emily looked like she had been dwelling on that revelation from the masseuse Destinee.<br><br>"I've been trying to work out where I have seen that woman who was leaving before." Cara admitted.<br><br>"Do you think it could be her?" Emily asked eagerly.<br><br>"If I could remember where I knew her from, then I might have an idea." Cara conceded.<br><br>"I didn't get a good look at her, but she didn't seem anything special."<br><br>"That would be Dad," Cara laughed.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Cara put down her knife and fork and looked hard at her sister. "I wouldn't put it past him. The mailgirls in the US are like supermodel quality. The ones in Japan are just, you know, wow, unbelievably hot. And what would Dad do? He'd go and hire a bunch of literal girls next door." They both laughed.<br><br>"That would be him," Emily chortled. "Women's rights and all that. The upright respecter of women's virtue. I can see him making that sort of speech, I don't know, to his workers. 'These women are naked all day, but you must respect their boundaries.' That would be Dad."<br><br>Cara clicked, realising something. "That where I know her from. A session at Uni. Women's rights. She was on the panel. Must have been last year." Her jaw gaped open as she remembered.<br><br>"What is it?" Emily demanded, realising her sister was onto something.<br><br>"She works defending the rights of prostitutes and sex workers."<br><br>"Aren't sex workers prostitutes?"<br><br>Cara shook her head. "Sex workers are dancers, cam girls, prostitutes, strippers..."<br><br>"And mailgirls!" Emily realised. "There must be a connection."<br><br>Cara shook her head. "If only I could remember her name."<br><br>Emily smiled wide at her sister. "All this mailgirl talk is getting me horny."<br><br>"What are you suggesting?" Cara sighed.<br><br>"Oh be fun," Emily complained. "Just for that I want to take you to a strip club.<br><br>Cara stared hard at her sister. "Why?"<br><br>Emily smiled back unflustered. "That sweater and jeans combination you're wearing are just so you. I'm going to get you to loosen up. Get you into some of my outfits." She slid her chair back so her sister could see how little of her legs were covered by her miniskirt.<br><br>"And staring at dancers taking off their clothes is going to do that? Is this your introduction to the mailgirls lifestyle?" Cara challenged.<br><br>Emily shook her head. "Cara, mailgirls is a totally nude thing, it's not a striptease. Look at the videos. You don't see mailgirls taking their clothes off. Their clothes are off. That's the point. You won't understand it until you've done it."<br><br>Cara sneered. "So it's not about the sex?"<br><br>Emily sighed. "It's all about sex. But in a different way. Now, you're my sister and you see me naked all the time. I don't think I've seen your legs since swimming lessons in grade six."<br><br>"And that is a bad thing?"<br><br>"I want to share with you," Emily pleaded.<br><br>"And I want to share with you. But not your manias. Can we draw a line?"<br><br>Emily pouted. "Okay, I'll draw a line for now. But you don't know what you're missing out on."<br><br>Cara studied her sister closely. "And your production?" Neither of them noticed the man at the table nearby who was ignoring his friends to instead pay close attention to everything that they were saying to each other.<br><br>Emily looked insulted. "Our little production?"<br><br>"Sorry," Cara backtracked.<br><br>Emily perked up. "I was going to tell you. We've got a job for you. With your clothes on. Say you'll do it."<br><br>Cara smiled. "I'll do it."<br><br>Emily clapped her hands. "Great. Now, to get you into a strip club to get a sweaty naked girl slithering all over you!"<br><br>Looking away from her excited sister, Cara caught the eye of the man who had been listening to them. She stared into him. He did not flinch for a moment until the woman sitting next to him tugged his sleeve to bring him back into her conversation. Cara looked back to Emily who was checking herself in a small vanity mirror, primping herself for their next destination.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch looked up from his computer as Mr Harada walked into his office looking self-satisfied.<br><br>"I'll be leaving to go back to Japan soon," Mr Harada told Mitch as he sat down facing him.<br><br>Mitch looked at the floor, then at the desk between them. "Something I have to discuss with you," he started carefully. Mr Harada stared at him, sensing the power disparity that Mitch was also aware of. But since he had started... "I have heard that you have acted inappropriately towards Pam and Fanny."<br><br>"What do you mean?" Mr Harada asked stonily.<br><br>Mitch tried to get a hint of contrition from Mr Harada's stance. He realised that was not going to happen. "You cannot do that with these women?"<br><br>"Do what?" Mr Harada challenged.<br><br>"With Pam you propositioned her, according to what I heard, and you refused to take no for an answer." Mr Harada chose to remain silent. So Mitch continued. "I understand that you summoned Fanny for another 'talk' about her research?"<br><br>"I did," Mr Harada threatened.<br><br>"This required you to grope her breasts while she was on her laptop reading you some of her research."<br><br>"There was no complaint."<br><br>Mitch help firm. "No, there wouldn't be?" he challenged.<br><br>Mr Harada licked his lips. "She gently pushed me away when she had enjoyed it sufficiently." Mitch started at Mr Harada. "I pay the bills!" he shouted.<br><br>Mitch kept his voice calm. "I know you do. But that does not mean that you can control and manipulate everyone who works for you like that."<br><br>Mr Harada did not back down. "What do you think it means?" he snarled.<br><br>"There is corporate responsibility and there are workers' rights."<br><br>"Ha ha," Mr Harada responded.<br><br>Mitch gave in to his exasperation. "There are penalties if we go too far with this. The Fair Work Commission will enforce the limits of the mailgirls' contracts. And there is plenty in them about unwanted and uninvited contact."<br><br>Mr Harada shook his head like he knew how things really worked. "We'll see how interested they are in this enforcement," he responded calmly, like the sort of boss who did not have to bother with such mundane things as rules and the law. "Now I have some reports to review with you. Prepared by my assistants," he added pointedly.<br><br>Yeah, Mitch thought ruefully, the ones who take their clothes off and have sex when you tell them to.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>In his usual excited manner, Shane strode into Mitch's office. "Have you tried to get a mailgirl recently?" he demanded.<br><br>Mitch looked up at him and shook his head. "Why?" he asked his deputy.<br><br>Shane held out his screen at Mitch. "Because you can't. The app's gone down."<br><br>Mitch looked at his screen. "You're right, I can't get mine to work either."<br><br>"I've rebooted and all that. At least it's not just me." Mitch got up from his chair. "What are you doing?" Shane asked, but Mitch silently beckoned Shane to follow him. They stepped past Betty Cuthbert and out to the window that looked down on the mezzanine. Where they could see the five mailgirls who were on call for the day were all lazing on the benches. Mitch shrugged at Shane and led him further out and to the stairs. They had four flights of stairs to descend. Shane was puffing as they got to the mezzanine. "I'm glad I'm not a mailgirl," he gasped.<br><br>Mitch who appeared to have not exerted himself turned and smiled. "The mailgirls have to go up those stairs to get to us."<br><br>"Doubly glad then," Shane heaved as he sucked in big breaths before he presented to the mailgirls.<br><br>"Ready?" Mitch smiled at him and opened the door to the mailgirls' room.<br><br>Kimiko was characteristically keeping to herself in a far corner of the room, concentrating on something on her laptop. Fanny had the other three, Pam, Jackson and Jan interested in something that she was telling them. She stopped when she saw Mitch enter the room and smiled at Mitch along with her audience. They noticed Shane behind him and stiffened up visibly as he entered, feet on the floor, legs together.<br><br>"Sorry to interrupt," Mitch started. "But have any of you had any errands in the last little while?"<br><br>Shane pushed to Mitch's side. "The app's down. It's not working," he stated somewhat urgently.<br><br>"Let's have a look," Jan agreed.<br><br>Kimiko looked up at them and smiled. "I was wondering why Mrs Ogawa hadn't summoned me this afternoon." She looked at her app and then to Jan. "Not working?" she asked the tall triathlete. The others watched Jan check her device. She looked like she knew what she was doing.<br><br>After a few moments concentrating on her device, Jan looked seriously at Mitch. "It's definitely down," she confirmed. "I'll go up to see the BAD guys, see what they can do." She stood up to exit the room. "Jackson," she laughed, "how do I get my incentives for this job?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. Fanny looked over, smiled at her friend and spoke up. "Jackson is finding the clause in our contracts now, aren't you?"<br><br>"Leave it with you," Jan laughed as she went out the door.<br><br>The remainders looked at each other for a moment then Kimiko went back to what she was doing. Mitch saw a chance for some small talk. "How are you settling in, Fanny?" he asked her first as he stood near the door.<br><br>Shane bustled past Mitch and stood near where Pam was sitting on the bench. He put a foot up on the bench near Pam without apparently considering what he was doing. "And how are you settling in?" he spoke down at her.<br><br>Pam visibly slid away from Shane. "Everyone has been very nice," she tried in tone that suggested she would like to keep it that way. Shane placed his shoe back down on the floor and stepped back to lean against the near wall.<br><br>Jan returned with one of the techs from BAD Solutions walking behind her, clearly ogling her from behind and Jan acting like she did not mind. "We had a look at their hardware," Jan announced. "It looks like something to do with the config of the server running the app."<br><br>"What she said," mumbled the tech who was still enthralled with Jan's athletically tight bottom.<br><br>Kimiko looked up. "Can you fix it?" she asked the tech.<br><br>He smiled. "I remember you," he gleamed.<br><br>Kimiko looked unimpressed. "I don't remember you," she stated flatly. "Can it be fixed?"<br><br>"I just need to look at your displays," the tech replied.<br><br>Jackson cracked first. "Our displays, girls!" she laughed.<br><br>This time he blushed. "Er, your device screens, I mean. No offence and all that," he dissembled.<br><br>"Displays!" burbled Shane, having just worked it out. Mitch shook his head and the other mailgirls chose to act like they had not heard it.<br><br>The tech looked at their screens, checked their wifi connections and shrugged. He phoned his colleagues on the third floor. After the call, the tech looked over to Mitch. "They say that they are working on it. They can't make any promises for the rest of the day."<br><br>Mitch looked around the room. "Well, there's no point in you all hanging around here unless you want to. Take an early finish if you want."<br><br>That got general agreement and a movement towards their lockers. Shane gave Mitch a questioning look. Mitch smiled at him. "I'll send an email around. They get the afternoon off. For the rest of us it's back to email, messaging and plain old-fashioned talking."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane messaged Mitch in the morning. Still not working? The answer to that was pretty obvious. Mitch went out of his office and looked down to the mezzanine. He could tell that the five mailgirls he had let off early were down there along with Heather. Mitch took the lift down to the mezzanine and found Heather was getting some stick from the others for being away the previous day.<br><br>"I don't understand," Heather asked them. "You think I missed out because by not coming in, I didn't get allowed to go home two hours early? My little brain can't calculate how that's something I missed out on." She picked out the most inquisitive of the new mailgirls. "Yes, Fanny, I had clothes on all day. Are you going to write that in your book?"<br><br>Pam gasped with some shock. "A book?"<br><br>Heather looked at her with some pity. "Pam, she studies mailgirls for her university. I guess she's going to write a book about us." She looked around at the rest. Even Kimiko looked up from her screen. "What? Are you surprised that I know things? Fanny, no offence meant, is not a name you hear every day. I was sure I had seen it somewhere. So I put your name into the Google machine. You'd be amazed at what comes out. It's like the internet knows everything about you! Amazing."<br><br>Eyes did turn towards Fanny. But before she could offer anything, Wendy Turnbull appeared. She smiled with her customary efficacy. "Since there's no work for you at the moment, we may as well do a proper inspection." The girls all groaned. But they got up and headed to their lockers for razors and makeup. "Let's say, fifteen minutes," Wendy suggested which got them moving a bit faster. Mitch noticed that Jackson moved with the same level of concern as the others. He realised that he did not expect Jackson to be so concerned to pass the inspection. He expected her to be divorced from that sort of obedience. But there she was checking her underarms and her crotch in the mirror, preparing to perfect herself for Wendy Turnbull's gaze.<br><br>"After that, you'll have time to fulfil your ambitions to be a mailgirl too," Jan suggested loudly to Wendy.<br><br>She stared down Jan. "That sort of thing I expect from Heather," she retorted.<br><br>"I think it's a great idea," Heather joined in. "You could just be a mailgirl here. No one would see you." Heather looked around and made eye contact with Mitch. "Except for us and anyone who accidentally came in."<br><br>Mitch felt someone enter the room behind him. He turned enough to recognise Mrs Ogawa who went over to Kimiko and spoke rapidly in Japanese to her. Kimiko was evidently explaining the tech problem to her. When she was done Mitch looked over to her. "Mrs Ogawa says that this problem never occurs in Japan," Kimiko told him.<br><br>"Of course it doesn't," Mitch mumbled. But loud enough for a few of the mailgirls to titter. Mitch looked to Mrs Ogawa with concern. But to his surprise, she gave him a smile. Although he felt there were some layers to it that he could not read. He only hoped that she understood how things were.<br><br>Jan spoke up. "Mitch, is it okay if I go up to BAD Solutions and look in to see what they are doing?"<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "I can't see that would be a problem." Jan left at that point, so Mitch saw it as a good time for him to leave the mailgirls' room as well. He looked at Shane with the intent for Shane to join him.<br><br>When they were in the lift, Shane smiled at Mitch. "Don't you want to see Wendy Turnbull in the nude too?"<br><br>Mitch looked confused. "Why?"<br><br>Shane was unruffled. "She's a good looking woman. I would certainly like to have her delivering my messages."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "That's exactly what I was afraid of." Shane seemed not to understand, so Mitch did not pursue it. Would Harada Industries not be complete until every women there was working in the nude? No, he would not try to explain himself to Shane. Mitch got out at the sixth floor. He nodded at Betty Cuthbert and asked her how she was today.<br><br>"Are the mailgirls still out?" she enquired. Mitch answered in the affirmative. "Pity," she responded and went back to her work.<br><br>Jan marched into Mitch's office some time later. Mitch smiled at her. "I'd almost got used to not having mailgirls in my office," he tried.<br><br>"It's only been half a day," she replied apparently missing Mitch's attempt at humour as she sat down, straight backed facing him. Mitch said nothing so she continued. "They don't know how to fix it," she reported. "I watched them for a while and asked a few dumb questions, you know, the sort that you would expect from a naked mailgirl." She smiled slyly. It's always fun," she laughed as she spread her legs enough to run a finger between her labia. "I think I may have distracted them, you know, so they let their guards down." She reached deep with two fingers then smiled at Mitch. "You couldn't spare a fingernail, could you?" Mitch looked at her taken aback, so she backtracked on that. "Maybe later. I need to find out what all the fuss is about. Everyone is talking about it. Anyway, can you give me access to the servers? I think I know how to fix it."<br><br>Mitch gave her a look of disbelief. Jan laughed. "Oh you think I now have a mailgirl brain too? Try to remember, what was my job before I agreed to do this?" Mitch rolled his eyes with the memory and grimaced at Jan's reproving look. "So when I say I can fix it..."<br><br>Mitch nodded. "Sorry, I should have known. Let's go to the tenth floor. Do you need anything?"<br><br>Jan rose with with a sense of purpose, licking her fingers. "Like I said, I just need access to the servers."<br><br>"Okay then," Mitch repeated, "let's go." He followed the athletic mailgirl and former programmer out of his office towards the stairs as Betty Cuthbert shook her head at him. Jan stood legs astride at the exit, running her hand up and down her body from just above her crotch to between her breasts as Mitch explained to Betty where they were going.<br><br>"Do you have to do that?" he asked Jan as soon as they were on the stairs, walking up side by side.<br><br>Jan smiled. "As long as it gets a reaction from Betty Cuthbert, yes," she admitted. She was soon striding ahead of Mitch on their way up the stairs. Mitch was feeling the strain on his legs while Jan's ascent seemed effortless. And Mitch strained enough to keep his attention on her firm bottom and the occasional glimpse of slit between her legs as she strode up the stairs. And Jan was on the phone with an IT mate, discussing ways to fix the problem as she kept up her pace.<br><br>All Mitch could think about was whether he was paying the mailgirls enough. They were in so many ways so much value for money. Jan had the app back running after only a few short minutes.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane strode into Mitch's office and shut the door behind him. He had intent in his eyes. "Have you heard the news?" he asked.<br><br>Mitch clearly misread him. "There's good rocking tonight?" he smiled.<br><br>Shane stopped just in from the entrance and froze. "You haven't heard."<br><br>Mitch was still misreading his lieutenant. "The new Grange is out?"<br><br>Shane looked concerned. "You really should read your emails from Mr Harada. I would have sent Jackson to you with it in a message, but she's got the day off." He took a step closer and checked his friend's face for any hint he knew. Sensing not, he continued. "Okay, you're sitting down so I can tell you. They're bringing in Lindsay Davenport."<br><br>Mitch looked confused. "From the US office?"<br><br>Shane nodded sagely and intoned "the very same."<br><br>Mitch grew more alert. "What is she going to be doing here?"<br><br>Shane shook his head sadly. "You really don't know. Well, I can't break this any other way. She's going to be doing your job."<br><br>They stared at each other for a long while.<br><br>`

                    title: "Pt. 6",
                    subtitle: "Australian mailgirls turn everything upside down.", 
                    content: `Mitchell Johnson having just been sacked as the head of Harada Industries' Australian office sat at his desk at a loose end wondering what to do. He toyed with using the mailgirls app, but did not have anything to tell anyone and decided he did not want to waste any mailgirl's time. He felt a pang, knowing that he could summon Jackson, the mailgirl he felt closest to. She would be happy just to chat, but Mitch wondered if he would be compromising her status in the office if she was seen with him too much. And what would they discuss? He really did not want to pour out his heart, spend his time complaining to anyone about his fate, especially her.<br><br>The app though was temptation. Send a request and one of the eight nude women in the office would soon appear to see what he wanted. He was still the general manager until his replacement arrived. Did he want an attractive, friendly and naked woman in his office? What, after all, was the point of the mailgirls? Mr Harada had told him that Melbourne had to have mailgirls, so Mitch introduced them to Australia. But he never wanted nude mailgirls in the office. And he felt more than a bit aggrieved that Mr Harada had sacked him over the mailgirls.<br><br>His phone rang, Mitch was pleased that it was Jessica, his wife. "How's my mailboy?" she started, clearly in a playful mood. "Been better," he growled trying to sound more up than he was. "Are you making your deliveries on time?" she teased. "I'm always on time," Mitch laughed, playing their private game. "I may have a treat for you tonight if you meet your targets," Jessica continued. This would have something to do with their role playing at home where she acts the boss in full leathers while Mitch played the nude mailboy running her errands. No doubt Jessica had already contrived to get the twins out of the house for the evening so that the two of them could cavort privately. "Anyway," she added more seriously, in conclusion, "keep your head down and remember that so long as you're there, they are still paying you."<br><br>Ending the call, Mitch accepted that she was right. He looked at his PC screen, no emails to deal with. He looked out through his office door to see his PA Betty Cuthbert was as usual busy with something that took all her concentration. If she needed him for anything or if he was required by anyone else, she would let him know but she did not need him at present, that was obvious.<br><br>Suddenly the lithe mailgirl Annette Kellerman strode part Betty Cuthbert's desk with a quick nod at the PA as she passed. Mitch noted that Betty had thawed enough to acknowledge that the mailgirls existed even if she had not completely reconciled to the reality that naked young women strode past her desk many times a day. Annette opened the door to Mitch's office and smiled at him from the entrance. "Shane said he'd like you to drop up to his office if you're not busy."<br><br>Mitch mumbled his thanks to Annette who reached high up the door frame with one hand posing her opposite hip at Mitch, looking over her shoulder at him, serpentine and slinky. Mitch stared at her, wondering why she was making such a deal out of her posing. He started to get up from his desk. "Your app," she reminded him.<br><br>"Oh yeah," Mitch remembered now seeing that he needed to mark her delivery as complete. Annette relaxed, leaning back against the frame now as she checked her app. Her bottom rested against the frame for a moment. Then she then dashed off without waiting to see if Mitch wanted anything more from her. He sighed, maybe that was the way that it was from now on.<br><br>"I'm going up to see Shane," Mitch told Betty although he expected she already knew that. She nodded, giving him a sad smile. Mitch's office was on the sixth floor and his deputy Shane Crawford's was on the tenth. Mitch thought of taking the stairs partly because the exercise and partly because he had no need to hurry. But the thought of encountering any of the mailgirls — but to be honest, especially Jackson when he was in this down mood — steered him towards the lifts. The mailgirls used the stairs, never the lifts.<br><br>Getting out of the lift, Mitch made his way through the IT staff who recognised he was clearly heading to Shane's office at the back. One or two of the staff looked up and gave Mitch strange looks. One of the women sitting behind her desk near the far wall turned to her colleague with a look of surprise. "I didn't think Mitch was like that." She did not think she had said it loud enough for Mitch to hear and looked mortified when Mitch stared over her way as clearly he had. He stood and thought for a moment about questioning her then decided better of it and continued towards Shane's out of the way office.<br><br>Mitch assumed that the look on his face must have in some way betrayed his feelings about his demotion to the IT staff. And they were perhaps trying to read him since he would swap offices with Shane when the new boss arrived, while the company decided what to do with him. Meaning the IT staff would wonder if they had to act busy when he was around. Normal office stuff. He did not know them well, and they did not know him.<br><br>Thinking on all that but trying to look less dispirited than he felt, Mitch went straight into Shane's office, expecting that Shane would be waiting for him. He stopped two steps in. Shane was sitting on his couch mostly obscured by the mailgirl Heather McKay who was of course naked. Mitch immediately recognised her broad shoulders and her long brown hair that fell well down her back. He took a moment to register that Shane's pants were pooled at his feet on the floor and that Heather was sitting on him. They were fucking.<br><br>Mitch wondered if he should be angry or upset. Still thinking of himself as the boss so maintaining some managerial distance, he tried a light opening. "Oh great," he exclaimed with mock concern, "and this is to be my office soon." But he got no acknowledgement from the couple who kept up their rhythm, apparently concerned only with each other. Any worries that Mitch had about Heather being coerced or a victim was dispelled by how tightly she gripped Shane around his neck as she rode him.<br><br>"Shane!" Mitch exclaimed loudly enough that this time they both looked over at him.<br><br>Shane smiled, utterly unfazed. "Want to join in?" he suggested as he kept thrusting.<br><br>Heather too smiled at Mitch and leant forward across Shane as she alluringly licked her lips at Mitch. She groaned. "You're deeper," she announced, "hitting a really good spot." She grinned at Mitch. "You can do me up the shooter," she beckoned.<br><br>Mitch decided the best way was no way. "No thanks," he politely declined.<br><br>"Head job?" Heather offered.<br><br>Mitch held a neutral smile. "No, I'm fine." He did not want to insult her. But he was the boss. At least he felt he still had to act that way.<br><br>Shane gripped Heather's arm as he thrust deep into her, turning her face to his with his other hand and making eye contact again with her. "Mitch is staying loyal to his wife, Heather," he told her.<br><br>"That's good Mitch," Heather agreed in her straightforward way giving the married Shane a proprietorial look. Shane responded with his disarmingly boyish smile as he kept up his rhythm.<br><br>"Thanks for that level of interest, both of you," Mitch mocked. Mitch was determined to stay loyal to Jessica and that excuse was as good a way to get around Heather's offer as any he could think of.<br><br>Shane chuckled. "She who must be obeyed," he gently taunted.<br><br>So true, thought Mitch. He wondered for an instant if it was possible that Shane knew anything about what went on between Jessica and him at home. He could not imagine that Shane could know, he was just being funny Shane style. Although Hollie Crawford, Shane's wife, and Jessica were friends, and who knows what they talked about. Maybe he should check with Jessica. "By the way," Mitch asked him, "what did you want to see me about?"<br><br>That brought Shane back to business. He stopped thrusting and looked the mailgirl in the eyes. "Oh yeah," he remembered. "Heather, you don't mind giving us some privacy. We can finish off later, if you're not busy."<br><br>"Sure," she agreed as she slowed the pace of her pumping. Heather sat still on him for a moment then eased off Shane like it was no big deal that they have been fucking in the office in full view of Mitch and, he now realised, the knowledge of everyone in the IT department outside his office. "No worries Shane," Heather assured him, "it was fun."<br><br>Mitch sensed a certain familiarity in the tone of her reply, like this was not a rare or first time. Having got off him she adjusted her hair, trying to look more kept than she obviously was and then gave him a nice kiss on the mouth. She sauntered past Mitch towards the door, playing up the swaying of her breasts, the swinging of her bare wide hips then turned and blew Shane a final kiss. And she was gone.<br><br>"Shane!" Mitch exclaimed with Heather departed, the door closed, now just the two of them.<br><br>Shane smiled as he stood up to get back into his trousers. "She's a great girl," he shrugged in his typical 'she'll be right' loveable Shane manner. He gave Mitch his trademark charming smile. "But she'll be happier if we can ever find a way to get her to the States," he concluded. Shane went over to sit behind his desk so Mitch sat down opposite. "Now what are we going to do about you? You realise that they can't sack you?" Shane started.<br><br>Mitch had not thought that far ahead. But he immediately saw that Shane was right. Shane went on to list all the obvious reasons that Mitch could not be terminated. If he was, there would be nothing to stop him giving the press all the tales about mailgirls in Melbourne that they were chasing. Not for trying, but so far the media had no idea what went in Australia's first mailgirls office. Plus Mitch could consider possible unfair dismissal since Mr Harada had replaced him apparently on a whim. A pretty flimsy whim too. And then there were the many ways that Mitch could take Harada Industries' business to their competitors if he was no longer working for the company. But if Mitch was staying, they both wondered, what would Mitch do at Harada Industries?<br><br>"Have you thought about threatening to quit?" Shane asked. "That would put it up them."<br><br>Mitch explained that Jessica liked the idea of him drawing his wage while not doing any work at all for it. Shane smiled. "I almost wish that it was me who got sacked if that was the deal."<br><br>Mitch gave him a questioning look. "You don't do any work now, do you?"<br><br>"Too true," his deputy agreed. "I guess you are going to find out what it is to be like me." Shane looked a little too self satisfied at that.<br><br>Mitch groaned. "Do I really want to know what that is like?" They both laughed. Mitch almost forgot whether he should worry about Shane, the number two in the office, fucking a mailgirl. But then he was no longer the boss.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Marjorie Jackson leaned over Mitch to look at what he was showing her on his computer screen. The mailgirl lazily rubbed one nipple against his shoulder but given he had his suit jacket on he did not react. She suspected that her contact was soft enough that he probably did not even notice. Well, his loss. Then she snapped out of her soft enjoyment to remember that she did need to concentrate on what Mitch was showing and telling her. She fought back her desire for the moment, keeping her hand away from her pussy. Something happened to her when they were together, just the two of them. Something like strong desire. She enjoyed being nude in the office and especially being nude with Mitch.<br><br>Mitch pointed at the screen. "I used your template and drafted this one here, see if you like it." She rested a hand on his padded shoulder allowing her to rub her breast against his shoulder blade. Mitch still did not react. "I've extended you for twelve months with a modest pay increase," he told her. "You can break it for any reason, well you don't actually have to give a reason, on four weeks' notice. The company can only break it early if we pay out your contract in full. Plus an extra lump sum penalty. There." He pointed.<br><br>As Mitch had turned to look for her reaction, Jackson beamed down at him as she tweaked the nipple she had been rubbing against him. They smiled at the audacity of the penalty payment. "My union would be proud of my negotiating skills, getting those conditions out of you," she laughed. As she now gave into her needs and ran her hand down through the neat bush above her bare slit, a bush that she sported under the office's relaxed mailgirl rules.<br><br>No body hair was the rule for the Japanese and American mailgirls. The Australian mailgirls had choice. Most chose to keep themselves neat. But Heather McKay and Fanny Durack had some wisps in their armpits. Fanny in her continuing academic research on mailgirls had focussed on how the Australian mailgirls looked more like real women that people actually encountered in their lives. And having some pubic hair as well as in other places underlined this. The Japanese mailgirls and to some extent the American ones — who had to shave clean below the neck every morning — seemed more like unattainable artefacts than real women. It was explained in Fanny's blog and her draft thesis.<br><br>Jackson made certain that her boss watched her stimulating herself, standing over him. She kept one hand on his shoulder as he sat. She moved her other hand below her bush, brushing her clit. Mitch, as ever, acted like he was not affected by her display. Although this time he admitted to some new confused emotions since catching Shane fucking Heather.<br><br>"Yes, it was difficult," he responded, musing on his double meaning. His feelings for Jackson grew stronger, but he chose not to explore them, concerned about where they could lead. With a happy home life, a wife and children, and as a good manager, he automatically thought at least two steps ahead. Always aware of where acting on his feelings for Jackson could lead. And succumbing to one or, god forbid, more of the other seven mailgirls? To Mitch that meant facing serious consequences one or two steps further down the line. Marriage, his status in the office, and looking his daughters in the eyes, for starters.<br><br>He snapped out of that. "Okay, if you're happy with the contract let's print it out and get it signed and completed."<br><br>Jackson stopped caressing herself and nodded her agreement, so Mitch hit print. Before he could make any movement to look after it himself, Jackson went over to his printer and managed to bend over it exposing herself from the rear, showing her behind and of course her pussy as she collated the papers coming out of the machine. Mitch wondered at this woman who could simultaneously provide sage advice on complicated employment issues and pretty much at the same time also flaunt her naked body in a completely sexual way. She was a circle that he was unable to square, no doubt part of his desire for her.<br><br>Having assembled the papers, Jackson sat herself opposite Mitch and signed her contract tying her to naked office behaviour for another year. Mitch signed, exercising his managerial authority for perhaps the last time. Jackson took the papers back to the printer giving Mitch the same display as previously, while she scanned the signed version through for him.<br><br>"Okay," he announced after a moment working at his screen, "the contract is with HR. That should be it. Probably the last substantial thing I do as boss of the office."<br><br>"That calls for a celebration," Jackson smiled as she returned from the printer, this time heading over to Mitch's side of the desk so she could plant her butt on it and spread her legs facing him, her foot on his thigh. She smiled at Mitch who she had pinned in his place. Under the office rules the mailgirls could ask the fabrics to assist them with their pleasure. Jackson began to wank herself off, maintaining eye contact with her boss as she started to groan and thrust, clearly hitting the right spots. Then she stopped suddenly. "It's better," she gasped, "when you do it."<br><br>The clothed staff could say no. Mitch teasingly rolled his eyes and took a moment to let her wonder whether he would help. But after a moment he reached forward and did as she commanded.<br><br>"That," Jackson groaned, "is perfect." He placed one hand on her thigh so that he could reach deeper with the other as they held eye contact. Jackson pressed up into his hand and throbbed against his fingers, pushing down on him with her foot, surprising herself at how quickly she could cum. "Mitch, Mitch!" she cried as she gripped his arm.<br><br>For some reason Mitch looked past Jackson as he continued, almost instinctively knowing how to satisfy the writhing mailgirl. Looking out of his office, Mitch made eye contact with Betty Cuthbert who had glanced over from her desk, maybe attracted by the groans Jackson was making. Instead of her usual disdain, Betty's stare was neutral, perhaps she really was coming to accept the situation as it was. Mailgirls and their behaviour were in the office to stay. Mr Harada had made that much clear.<br><br>But then Jackson pressed her crotch harder onto Mitch's hand and came again, this time so strongly she reached up and gripped him in an embrace as she shuddered herself to completion.<br><br>"That... was... great," she eventually gushed.<br><br>Mitch smiled as he gently worked his fingers in and out of Jackson, helping her to come down. "Yes it was," he smiled.<br><br>Since she was so close Jackson reached over and kissed Mitch. Firstly on the cheek like a thank you. Then on the mouth. To his surprise, Mitch responded, his hand still working her pussy. They kept on for a while until Mitch removed his hand sensing that his work for her was done for the moment. "Office husband!" she enthused, "what am I going to do without you?"<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "I'm not leaving. In fact, I'm not going far. For the moment I am going as far as the tenth floor while they work out what to do with me. I expect they will give me a project." He repeated with some amusement, "a project. Shane laid the way things are for me. I'm like you are now in the respect that it would cost the company too much to actually get rid of me."<br><br>Jackson looked confused at that.<br><br>"They would have to buy my silence if they actually sacked me."<br><br>Jackson nodded realising that what Mitch said made a lot of sense. The lump sum in her contract was a lot of money to her. But for the company it was probably a cheap cost of insurance. And for at least another year it was her life. And whether or not Mitch was authorised to sign her contract, the company was in no position to renege on it. As with Mitch, it made more sense to keep her.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The office was buzzing. Jackson in particular was in demand, her app flashing as soon as she was free for another job. All her callers tried to pump her for anything she knew about Mitch's situation, who was going to replace him, and what that might mean for the office. She responded to her fifth callout of the morning this time from one of the assistants in HR, Martin. "I've been too busy to even have time for a wank," she told the unabashed young man as she stood naked near his desk making small talk with him about HR issues while she waited for him to get to the point.<br><br>"There's the dildo station," he politely informed her, gesturing to the table with the implements on it over near the wall.<br><br>"Don't mind if I do," she replied and went over to chose the butterfly vibrator on the basis that it got her off quicker. She walked back to Martin's desk with the vibe already between her legs starting the stimulation. Getting there, she stretched back on the desk so that she could spread herself and get full access to getting herself off, with the thing on full power. It didn't take long.<br><br>When she was done, Jackson smiled her thanks at the HR guy who was trying to adopt the usual office approach to the mailgirls by appearing aware of her wanking but trying not to look too interested. She leaned forward amicably on his desk, hands under her chin, her firm breasts hanging visible to him, her nipples still hard. "Now what did you want me for? Don't tell me, you wanted to find out what I know about who is likely to replace Mitch?" Slightly embarrassed, he nodded. "Unfortunately I don't know anything. But if someone could take me out of the queue for a short while, I may actually have the time to do some digging and try to find out." Jackson smiled, trying not to look patronising. Haha, she thought, a naked post-orgasm patronising mailgirl. It must be why she enjoyed her job.<br><br>"Okay," he replied, still awkward about the whole thing. Since Martin was in HR, he had the power to remove Jackson from the queue as she had asked. He showed her the app to confirm that he had given her some time.<br><br>"Okay," she continued, "I'll do my digging. And I promise that you will be the fifth person to know if I find anything out." She smiled sweetly at the guy who seemed okay with her retort as she stood back up and rubbed her mound. "Oh, and thanks for the orgasm," she added. "I really needed that." She cleaned the vibe then replaced it on the table, waving at everyone in HR on her way out.<br><br>Martin turned to his nearby colleague, a young not unattractive woman called June once Jackson had gone. "I don't even remember what this office was like before mailgirls," he admitted.<br><br>June nodded. "I just try to treat them like everybody else," she offered. Which was her stock comment for the situation. Martin nodded his acceptance of her viewpoint and went back to his work. But he did not think that was the answer.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson went straight down to the sixth floor where she bailed up Betty Cuthbert who was in the kitchenette making a cup of tea. "Don't mind if I do," suggested Jackson as the kettle was approaching the boil. To her surprise Betty actually smiled back. What was going on with her, Jackson wondered as Betty grabbed another cup, apparently happy to pour for the mailgirl too.<br><br>They were alone. Betty looked around to check. "I don't know how you do it," she confided in Jackson who faced her confidently nude, clearly unconcerned by her effect.<br><br>"Can't say that I have any regrets," Jackson told her, which she knew was not an answer. She reached for her cup as the kettle boiled, but Betty waved her away.<br><br>"I'll pour," Betty advised firmly. "I'm not letting you near boiling water without, you know, protection."<br><br>"You know how I like it?" Jackson asked cheekily.<br><br>Betty ignored the second meaning. "How much tea do you think I have poured for you in your meetings with Mitch." Betty looked hard at the mailgirl after she had said that reading her reaction. "Mitch, the replacement, yes. I know what you want to ask," Betty stated plainly.<br><br>"Can you tell me? Are you allowed?" Jackson asked now trying to appear as demure as a nude woman in an office could be.<br><br>Betty nodded, crossed her arms and sighed. She spilt the news. "I've just seen the emails. We're getting a new boss from the States. Until then Shane is in charge."<br><br>Jackson gave Betty a look of mock horror. "Oh God, for how long?" she asked.<br><br>Betty replied offhand like it was no great deal. "She's already on the plane. So not too long, he can't do too much damage."<br><br>Jackson nodded at that, took the proffered cup, sipped at it with satisfaction and continued to probe as she drank it down. "Do you have a name?" She tried to ignore Betty Cuthbert's indiscretion, she had almost criticised a manager! Betty was indeed showing new angles.<br><br>Betty looked her in the eyes. Obviously Jackson had held her surprise at Betty's sudden unwinding within. "It's Lindsay Davenport," Betty told her, pulling a troubled face.<br><br>The name meant nothing to Jackson, but she read the concern and reflected Betty's seriousness back at her. "What do you know about her?"<br><br>"Well, she's American obviously. So she is going to have that approach."<br><br>"No sense of humour, hard working, long hours..."<br><br>"Of course that and..." Betty looked at Jackson surprised that the mailgirl's response had missed the obvious. Betty sighed and spelt it out. "You, the mailgirls. She is used to how the mailgirls are treated in the States, isn't she? She is going to have an attitude."<br><br>Jackson put on her bravest face. That was something. "I see," she responded grimly. "Thanks for thinking of us, I really appreciate it."<br><br>Betty Cuthbert looked at the floor. "Well," she measured, "at the end of the day we are all colleagues and we should look out for each other. I don't know what you can do. But if I know you, you'll think of something."<br><br>Jackson put her empty cup on the counter and in a gesture of thanks, put her hand on Betty's arm. The naked mailgirl realised that she was standing only centimetres from one of her serious detractors, and now she was in physical contact with her. To Jackson's surprise, Betty did not flinch, let her hold on. Jackson felt something electric, but Betty's look did not change. "Sorry," Jackson mumbled, let go and backed away, then headed off. She felt the urgency. Her first stop was the mailgirls' change room on the mezzanine.<br><br>Jackson reached her destination to luckily find all the mailgirls there. "Am I the only one getting calls?" she demanded as the others seemed settled and pretty relaxed.<br><br>"Don't worry," Jan assured her, "We're all only just back. IT have been constantly paging me. Apparently something is going to happen very soon and we are the ones who are supposed to know."<br><br>"Because the naked women in the office are the ones who know everything," Lauryn smirked.<br><br>That got a laugh from Heather, Annette, and Fanny. Pam nodded but did not seem to get it. Kimiko kept to herself. She may or may not have heard. Lauryn gave the impression that she was right back into the run of things. Jackson noticed that.<br><br>"I see that you are back with us," Jackson replied with a smile. First things first. "What did you get up to while you were away?"<br><br>"So I'll have to start the story again," Lauryn sighed looking to the others.<br><br>"Go on," Heather urged. "Jackson needs to know too."<br><br>So Jackson got to hear what Lauryn had already told the rest about her holiday break, away from work. "What was it like to not be a mailgirl for four weeks?" Fanny asked. Perhaps she was not content with the first answers from Lauryn, Jackson wondered, expecting the answers would become part of Fanny's research.<br><br>Lauryn happily obliged, told them that she had gone to Fiji for a few weeks. And that her bikini did feel a little weird for a while. Which got her to another issue, underwear. "It was so weird having it on all the time."<br><br>Which led to another tangent. Annette piped up. "Mine just sits in my drawer at home." She gave the others a daring look. "Well, except for weekends," she confided. After that, the group agreed that apart from bed, they had pretty much avoided wearing any, especially around the house.<br><br>"Weekends or not, I have to remember to put it on when I go out," chortled Heather.<br><br>Jackson decided it was time to break the news before anyone began a cross examination of Heather on her underwear. Jackson coughed for attention and then told the group the news from Betty Cuthbert.<br><br>"You're always the first one to find out," Lauryn laughed, "that hasn't changed."<br><br>Kimiko spoke up for once, from her relative privacy over in the back corner as usual. "I don't think it's a big deal, nothing will change."<br><br>Jan agreed, but looked to Jackson for acknowledgement. "We've got the contracts. So they can't make us do anything weird that we don't want to do?"<br><br>Jackson nodded. "I think whatever happens, Jan is right. We should be okay." That was good enough for the group, at least for the time being. No use, she decided, getting them worried as Betty was that things would change for the mailgirls. She had some more digging and some research to do about that. Still enjoying the lull in their call outs, the mailgirls split into their usual friendship groups, taking advantage of their free time. Jackson expected at least Fanny would try to prod her for more details, but Fanny instead approached Lauryn to ask if she could write up her holiday experiences for her research. So I was right, Jackson noted. She was the first to notice that Wendy Turnbull, the mailgirls' supervisor, had just come into their room, looking concerned as Betty Cuthbert had been.<br><br>Jackson went over to her and led her towards the showers where they could talk privately. "What's the problem?" Jackson asked her.<br><br>"I've just been to HR, in a meeting with Belinda," she revealed. Belinda Clarke was the head of HR. "Belinda has been asked to give the mailgirl contracts to a lawyer."<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "That shouldn't be a problem. Those contracts are pretty watertight."<br><br>Wendy shook her head. "Not any lawyer. She was asked to give them to an American labour lawyer."<br><br>At that news Jackson adopted Wendy's look of concern. Suddenly things were indeed much more serious.<br><br><br><hr><br><hr><br><br>There were different reactions to the news about the new boss around the office. Because of course, everyone soon knew. Betty Cuthbert was in Mitch's office explaining to him and Shane the latest update, that Lindsay Davenport was stuck in Honolulu, seemingly for a few days.<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "No one flying business class gets stuck in Honolulu for a few days."<br><br>Betty shrugged. "Well, she is. And I guess they can get stuck there if they want to."<br><br>Shane nodded. "I think Betty is right, it's a long trip, she wanted a few days stopover and couldn't get it on the company deal." He smiled at Mitch. "It means you're the boss for a little while longer. What are you going to do?"<br><br>Mitch looked at him. "I thought I was stripped of everything and you were supposed to be running the show."<br><br>Shane looked to Betty who gave Mitch that news. "It was too much of a hassle to organise the change to Shane and then to the new one. So Shane decided to keep things as they are."<br><br>Mitch shook his head in amazement at his deputy's ability to shirk.<br><br><br><hr><br><hr><br><br>Jackson dropped in on Mitch. "Quiet time," she told him, "so I thought I should drop in and see how you are." She leaned one elbow against the wall and stretched to her full height so she could show herself off to best effect, her bush well on display.<br><br>Mitch smiled but as ever tried to appear unmoved by her provocation. "Looks like I'm the boss for another few days," he told her.<br><br>Jackson nodded. "Yes, apparently your replacement is stuck in Honolulu for a few days. What are you going to do with your powers?"<br><br>Mitch laughed. "Well, first of all I thought of doing nothing. Then, oh you wouldn't have seen the email from HR. I offered all staff — except for the mailgirls obviously — the option to work at home for one or two days a week. I would have checked with you, but it doesn't make sense to be a mailgirl working from home."<br><br>Jackson looked interested. "So what happened? Are we going to have an empty office on Mondays and Fridays?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "The opposite. Not one person took it up. Everyone said no, even the women we thought might want to get away from mailgirls for a day or so. And also the ones, you know who they are, the ones who are still bristling about the whole mailgirl thing. Strange, I thought it would have done them good to not be around you for a few days. But no. In fact if you stay here with me, HR are coming down in a few moments with some info on why."<br><br>Jackson smiled dangerously. "I have nothing planned." She checked her app which apparently had no messages. "And it's always good to spend a bit of time with you."<br><br>Mitch hooked a finger at her. "Feel like?" he asked her.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "No thanks. Sometimes it's just nice to sit around and talk." She slunk over to the table and sat facing Mitch so they could smalltalk for a while.<br><br>Belinda Clarke, the head of HR arrived on the hour with the naked mailgirl Fanny Durack in tow. Fanny was literally in tow wearing a collar and a leash which Belinda held, leading her past Betty, who tried not to look surprised, and towards Mitch's office. With a deft movements of the leash, Belinda seated the mailgirl next to Jackson at Mitch's meeting table. Belinda then sat next her, letting the leash drop between Fanny's large soft breasts. Jackson looked over at Fanny with some surprise as Mitch went the short distance from his desk to the table. Belinda smiled at Jackson, acknowledging that she would be sitting in the meeting.<br><br>Fanny looked over and read Jackson's look of surprise. "Research," she told the other mailgirl.<br><br>"You want to know what it feels like to be Kimiko?" Jackson wondered.<br><br>"Something like that," Fanny admitted. Belinda leant over and loudly slapped each of Fanny's prominent breasts. Fanny shuffled in her seat, seemingly her treatment was turning her on as her breasts wobbled in response to the clothed woman's harsh treatment. The head of HR rubbed her palm looking uncomfortable with her actions.<br><br>Now it was Mitch's turn to be surprised. "Belinda!" he exclaimed.<br><br>Belinda smiled with resignation at him. "Mailgirl's orders," she advised. In the Melbourne office, as Mitch of course knew, the mailgirls could decide how they were treated by the clothed staff while setting their boundaries. It was all in black and white in their contracts.<br><br>With the formalities over Mitch pointed out that the reason for the meeting was the HR investigation into the non-take up of work from home by the staff. At that moment, Shane came in and apologised for being late.<br><br>Belinda smiled. "I'll defer to Fanny on that since she did the research." She slapped each of the mailgirls large breasts again with the same results as before.<br><br>Shane stared at Fanny and Belinda, surprised.<br><br>Mitch shook his head at his deputy. "Shane, if you had arrived on time, you would know what is going on. Now Fanny..."<br><br>Fanny smiled, licked her lips and started her explanation apparently not distracted by the reddening of her bosom. "From the survey it was clear that the men in the office prefer to come in each day, partly but not totally because of the mailgirls. At least that's what they said. Funny the effect that a naked woman can have on a man." She smiled at Shane who gave her a look that likely said 'later' as Mitch read it, now suspicious of all his deputy's interactions with the mailgirls. Fanny continued, unfazed. "The women — and the few men — who are opposed to mailgirls are still hoping to see a car crash, they are still hoping the mailgirls experiment here will go hopelessly wrong and they want to be present in the office when that happens. Failing that, at least the women who are anti, according to my research, are enjoying watching their male colleagues getting cowed by us."<br><br>Shane looked confused. "Cowed? Meaning?"<br><br>Fanny looked at him surprised he was not on her wavelength. "Controlled. Haven't you noticed?"<br><br>Mitch spoke up. "But you said that the men want to come in because of the mailgirls yet they are being controlled by them? Can that be right?"<br><br>Jackson butted in. "Mitch, even I can answer that one. The men in the office, right up to the most assertive ones are enjoying being dominated by the mailgirls. Perhaps you haven't noticed?" And to play up to Mitch's attempt to look stoic in regards to that, Jackson ran a finger down her chest to gently play with her slit while holding eye contact with him.<br><br>Fanny smiled at Jackson, nodded her agreement, then continued. "And I've done some research on the other offices. Mr Harada offered working from home in Japan and no one took it up there either. Although when his people did their research, the reasons were somewhat different. They all wanted to be present in the office so that Mr Harada could see how hard they are working."<br><br>Mitch nodded. "That doesn't surprise me. And the States?"<br><br>Fanny let Belinda slap her breasts again, squirmed in her seat, then replied to Mitch this time with a catch in her voice, maybe a reaction to her stinging breasts. "That's a story. It was offered in the States. Those who took it were sacked." She gasped, sucking in some air as she squirmed in her seat.<br><br>Mitch looked startled at her statement. "What, sacked? Why?"<br><br>Fanny looked confidently at Mitch, her reddened breasts heaving. "It's what I've been discovering about the management's attitude to their staff there. All their staff, not just the mailgirls. We know that they want the rest of the staff to consider their mailgirls to be the bottom rung of the office hierarchy there, and we know why. Well, this is an extension of that. Very much a case of you will do as we tell you and work as hard as you can at all times. Climate of fear."<br><br>Jackson expressed her concern. "It sounds like the message is that the rest of the staff may think they have higher status than their mailgirls. But it's only a tiny amount higher. Sacked for the smallest infractions."<br><br>Shane joined the dots. "And it's coming here," he realised.<br><br>Fanny gave Shane her serious look. "The work from home victims. Do you want to know who did the sacking?"<br><br>Shane read the looks on the faces of both Fanny and Belinda. "Okay. I can guess."<br><br>Mitch smiled dryly. "That," he said slowly, "should be interesting." And, he could have added, not in a good way.<br><br>Jackson said nothing. She realised that she was going to be busy.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch had moved, he was in his new office on the tenth floor checking how empty his diary was. He had taken Shane's office and Shane had moved to the room next to the boss office on the sixth floor. It was getting close to 10.30am and Mitch decided that if he checked the newspapers, went out of the building to grab a second morning takeaway coffee and then attempted an online cryptic crossword, that he could productively or maybe not so productively get to lunchtime. Then it would be a simple matter of finding something to do in the afternoon. Shane had assured him that he would soon get actual projects to take up his time. They just had to work through some approval processes that Shane admitted he did not completely understand.<br><br>Being Shane, he gave Mitch his boyish smile as he suggested "just enjoy it while it lasts." Which was easy to say if you were not until recently the boss of a busy office.<br><br>He was about to go for that coffee when Kimiko Date, the mailgirl granddaughter of the company's owner Mr Harada, appeared at his door. He smiled at her wondering what version of herself she currently was. But all seemed normal with her. The thin, toned woman glided into the room and proceeded to wander past the couch running hand along it looking as if she was enjoying the memories. Oh god, Mitch thought, not you too? She glanced at him as if she had heard him ask the question and smiled as if the obvious answer was yes. Although no words were spoken.<br><br>She drifted close to Mitch who reclined back in his chair, behind his desk. "You look very relaxed, Mitch," she observed.<br><br>He smiled wanly. "I guess I am."<br><br>"Sorry, but I have a message for you. The new boss would like to meet."<br><br>Mitch nodded. "What is she like?" he asked. He had of course encountered her in management video conferences, but he had never had to deal with Lindsay Davenport in person.<br><br>Kimiko sat down opposite Mitch and crossed her legs, giving him the impression that she was taking that question seriously. Yet still she found a way to display her bare pussy and her slit, having crossed her legs only loosely.<br><br>"She is being very fussy at the moment. Nothing is right, everything in the office, in the country is wrong for her. She takes it as a personal insult that we drive on the left hand side of the road here."<br><br>"And how has she treated you so far?"<br><br>Kimiko shook her head. "Perfunctory." She thought for a moment. "She dressed down Pam."<br><br>Mitch looked urgently at her. "Pam? Why?"<br><br>"Bush." Kimiko spread her legs to show that hers was bare of hair.<br><br>Mitch exploded. "God, she hasn't seen Jackson yet in that case?"<br><br>Kimiko seemed to ignore that as she continued, legs spread but hands on the armrests. "Pam tried to explain that she was well in her rights and..." Mitch noted that Kimiko seemed relaxed in what she was telling. "...Lindsay acted as if she had not even heard her, it was like, as Pam said later, like Pam was not even there. She was just a body that had too much hair on it." Kimiko had of course worked for a while in the headquarters in Japan where mailgirls were punished for showing any hair below the neck at all. "It was like..." she started.<br><br>"Japan," Mitch finished for her. Putting his hands on the desk Mitch looked deeply into Kimiko's eyes. "If there is anything that I can do. I don't know what..." He thought for a moment. "How are things with Mrs Ogawa?" he asked. Mrs Owaga, Mr Harada's trusted disciplinarian from Japan had come to Melbourne on a mission. Kimiko had to translate for her as well as cater to her needs.<br><br>But the mailgirl gave him a strange look back. "Oh you probably don't know any more," she realised. "She was called back to Tokyo. I think she was happy to get out of here." Mitch nodded, wondering what that news meant. Mrs Ogawa had Mr Harada's ear, so it probably was not good. Kimiko stood up and reached across the desk to him with a soft hand that she ran under his chin for a moment. "I know, Mitch. You're a good person." She paused, checking her app. "And you're keeping the new boss waiting." She smiled hopefully.<br><br>Mitch stood up too as he marked Kimiko on his app. His thoughts about the impending meeting with Lindsay Davenport were clouded by a sense of a connection with Kimiko. Of course he may have simply been aroused by the sight of her firm thin bottom flexing as she left his room. Plus the hint she gave of her knowledge of Shane's office couch.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay Davenport did not get up from her seat, busy behind her desk, when Mitch entered her office. He found no alternative but to sit facing her as a visitor in what had been only days before his office. Trying not to show that he cared, he sat stiffly upright facing his replacement who appeared to be looking down on him from her higher seat. Typical manager act. She looked up from her work and stared at Mitch, stiffly formal and over-dressed to impress in a black jacket that partially covered a serious red top, an outfit designed no doubt to downplay her feminity. But it also allowed her to hint at some seriously shiny neck jewellery. And her sleeves sat back to reveal a man's heavy brand name watch and a number of understated yet stylish rings on her fingers. She was clearly playing all sides of the street, perhaps having planeed her appearance to confuse her audience so they did not know whether to expect a kitten or a tiger.<br><br>Lindsay smiled sweetly at Mitch. "Our management styles are quite different," she stated.<br><br>Mitch felt he had quite an amount of leeway. "Oh really," he replied, "I have no idea about your management style."<br><br>Unfazed, Lindsay sneered "I know all about yours. You've virtually let the mailgirls run the office." So she saw him as a weak manager.<br><br>Mitch felt he had to at least try to explain. "We are constrained here by the labour law," he started.<br><br>Lindsay seemed barely interested in his warning. "We'll see about that," she replied tartly.<br><br>Mitch smiled nicely for her. "Indeed we will," he rejoined deciding to test the cliché about Americans not getting Australian sarcasm.<br><br>"Too true," Lindsay agreed although she appeared suddenly distracted by some message that had just come up on her screen.<br><br>"Busy," she stated as if that would be a novelty to Mitch. "Excuse me." Mitch noticed that she had gone to the app.<br><br>Mitch decided to break their silence as they waited for a mailgirl to appear. "Was there anything that you specifically wanted me to tell you?" he tried.<br><br>"No," she snapped. Then smiled as sweetly as was possible for her at him. "I just wanted to meet you in person before the staff presentation."<br><br>At that moment Jackson appeared at the doorway. Lindsay beckoned her in.<br><br>"Which one are you?" Lindsay snapped at her.<br><br>"I'm Jackson," she replied as sweetly as she could as she approached the desk, her bush clearly visible. Mitch gave her a quick warning look. She had let it grow out, no longer shaving it bare. Was it a protest? At least, Mitch noted, she had kept it neat. He shuddered that in this mailgirl situation he was judging his colleague and friend by the amount and tidiness of her pubic hair.<br><br>Lindsay ignored Mitch to look Jackson over and then smiled, apparently choosing to avoid repeating the treatment she had given Pam Burridge for her bush. "That's right," she sneered, "I am constantly reminded that you have names not numbers. Well, Jackson, pleased to meet you. I hear that you're the trouble maker." Lindsay cocked her head to the side as if she too had been a troublemaker once, or something.<br><br>Jackson smiled somewhat defiantly back. "I think you'll find that we're all trouble makers."<br><br>Lindsay ignored that as she handwrote a note which she folded and gave to Jackson. "I need you to take this note to the head of HR. Can you manage that?"<br><br>Jackson held her rigid smile. "On a good day yes," she snapped back. And left.<br><br>Lindsay looked at Mitch. "There. You see, nice and simple. Master. Servant. That's how we start off making this an efficient office."<br><br>Mitch nodded and tried to hold a neutral gaze. He was fine, he knew. As Shane said, he was untouchable. But he worried about the others.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The staff had crowded in the large meeting room. Mitch found himself standing towards the back with Shane. Lindsay preened herself down the front of the room waiting for the hour to strike for the official start time as the large screen behind her lit up. Mr Harada appeared there, from Tokyo, and slightly out of focus.<br><br>Most of the staff had arrived early. Pam Burridge entered the room with another mailgirl, Jan Stephenson, the first mailgirls to arrive. Both women walked in tall and proud. They strode past the front between Lindsay preparing to present and the rest of the staff who were mostly facing the front, waiting for her to start. Pam turned her head to say something to Jan and her hair swished behind her, enticing in a way that both the men and women near her stopped their chatter for a moment and stared. Pam walked it like a fashion catwalk, her hips swaying as she placed one long leg in front of the other. Mitch noticed that she still had bush. Jan sauntered along easily as though she had warmed up and was ready to start a race. Then, as if she had just realised she was naked in a room full of clothed office workers, Pam suddenly avoided Jan's conversation, and put her hands in front of her crotch. Was she blushing? She continued quickly, alone, off to the far side of the room where it would be hard to look at her without craning away from the focus of proceedings. Jan stopped to chat with some of her former team mates, barely registering Pam's moment or that she was gone.<br><br>Towards the back of the room, Shane noted Pam's behaviour then looked concerned at Mitch. "I hope that she's settling in," he told his old boss. Then added "surprised you came."<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "Wouldn't miss it. And it's not like I have anything pressing on."<br><br>Shane laughed. "Enjoying the easy life."<br><br>Mitch looked curiously at him. "Shouldn't you be down the front of the room supporting the new boss?"<br><br>It was Shane's turn to shrug. "Just doing what I do best. Acting invisible. It's a survival skill." He gave Mitch a look suggesting that sometimes Shane handled the office better than he did.<br><br>There was general chatter around the room. Kimiko Date entered and pushed through from the front until she was standing next to Shane. She looked across him to smile at Mitch. Mr Harada who was still out of focus said something sharp in Japanese, presumably to one of his assistants.<br><br>Shane turned to the mailgirl. "What's he saying?" he asked.<br><br>Kimiko squeezed her taut body between Mitch and Shane, pressing against both of them. "Grandad says he can see us and wants them to find out if he is ready to start."<br><br>At that moment Jackson, Fanny and Annette Kellerman strode into the room in all their glory. As they entered, Annette turned to playfully slap Fanny's breast. Fanny affected not to react. Her large breasts gently swayed. The three mailgirls walked on with serious looks, all abreast, clearly wanting to make a sensation. They succeeded as they marched across the room, past Lindsay before heading separate ways into the crowd. They had stopped the buzz of conversation which was just as well as Mr Harada was tapping his desk for attention. Seeing Mitch, Jackson pushed through the attendees to reach him and gripped his arm. "You don't have to be here, you know," she told him. She nodded at Kimiko who gave her a wide smile in return.<br><br>"Well, I wasn't doing anything else," he offered as he had with Shane.<br><br>"Well at least move out of the camera shot," Jackson whispered while Mr Harada was still making his introductory comments about why Harada Industries was such a great place to work at. Since she already had hold of Mitch's arm, Jackson dragged him away to the side of the room careful to check that they were now out of the camera's range, leaving Kimiko and Shane in the centre of the room. "I'll bet she wants him to see her," Jackson whispered to Mitch.<br><br>Mr Harada was now on about the great future that lay ahead for the company and how all employees would benefit. There was a loud impassioned groan from the back of the room. Mitch looked over along with about half of the staff. Kimiko had found a table against the back wall. She sat there with her legs spread, vigorously wanking herself.<br><br>Mitch turned to Jackson and smiled. "Is the meeting supposed to ignore her?" Kimiko seemed to be approaching orgasm, judging by the grunts she was making.<br><br>"Just as well I got you to move. She is right there in the centre of the camera range," Jackson whispered back to Mitch. She shook her head in disbelief as more eyes turned to watch Kimiko rather than her grandfather. "That family really needs to sort themselves out," Jackson added.<br><br>Jackson nudged Mitch to check out the front of the room. Lindsay Davenport stood there stolidly as Mr Harada talked up her credentials as precisely what the Australian operation needed at the helm to go forward in a difficult world. Meanwhile Kimiko now tugged at her nipples, making loud yelps, with one hand on her clit and the other tugging at her breasts. She tried to grab both nipples at the same time with her one hand but she just could not grasp both her small breasts at the same time. Still she was doing enough to keep her excitation high. Her grunts of pleasure proved that.<br><br>Lindsay smiled at Mr Harada's compliments, trying to ignore the performance at the back of the room. "Thank you for your kind words," she started, nodding towards the screen to make eye contact with Mr Harada's image on the big screen. "And it is wonderful to meet you all here," she continued as she turned around to face her staff. "Yee-owwww!" Kimiko howled. Lindsay stopped for the moment conceding that she could not compete with the orgasmic mailgirl whose rampant cries had attracted the stares of the entire room. Lindsay kept a wide frozen smile on her face hoping, waiting for the mailgirl's performance to end. She tried to look as amicable as she could, but she had to hold it for longer than she hoped and her hopeful facade changed to impatience. Unaware, no doubt, not caring anything about Lindsay Davenport's discomfort, Kimiko continued with her tugging and frigging. "Yes, yes, yes," she spurted loudly as she hit another orgasm.<br><br>Mitch realised that Jackson had not let go of his arm and was now forcing his hand to the inside of her bare thigh. "I need..." she whispered to Mitch. But at that moment Lauryn pushed between the two of them, forcing Mitch's hand away and out of Jackson's grasp. "None of that in the meeting room," Lauryn hissed in fake dudgeon as she dragged Jackson a short distance away to press her against the near wall where she first of all gave her a deep kiss and then placed Jackson's hand on her pussy. And then reciprocated for Jackson. More discrete than Kimiko's ongoing performance, they attracted little attention apart from Mitch who watched the two of them kissing and fondling each other, wondering what might have been.<br><br>Shane appeared next to Mitch amidst Kimiko's now more subdued grunts and noticed how deeply Lauryn and Jackson were engaged with each other's bodies. "This is the sort of meeting I like," Shane grinned.<br><br>Mitch gave him a wry smile. "That's why I tried not to have too many," Mitch replied. He looked around the room. The other five mailgirls were feigning attention in Lindsay as she announced that she would like to get to meet all the staff but of course it may have to take her some time as she had so much to do and learn. Since she wanted to find out everyone's goals and aspirations.<br><br>"Aren't they the same thing?" Mitch asked Shane.<br><br>"She certainly has a lot to learn," Shane told Mitch, shocking him with his unexpected, and for Shane, rather sharp candour.<br><br>"Any questions?" Lindsay asked.<br><br>Heather shot her arm up. Mitch noticed how Heather's chest held firm and her smallish breasts barely moved. She's been working out, he concluded. Lindsay nodded at the stocky mailgirl, revealing a slight trepidation at what a mailgirl might ask her in front of the staff.<br><br>"You say that you are interested in our goals and aspirations," Heather started. Lindsay nodded. "I would like to be a mailgirl in America," Heather asserted in her usual straightforward way. There were a few titters amongst the other staff. Her aim was after all open knowledge since she had told anyone who would listen. And everyone knew that American mailgirls did not look like Heather.<br><br>But Lindsay looked straight at her with no apparent emotion. "Consider it done," she stated firmly.<br><br>Mr Harada muttered something from his vantage either not knowing or caring that his microphone was still on. Kimiko later translated it for Mitch. "Don't tell anyone else," she cautioned, "but grandad said 'that one should be on the farm, not in an office.' Pretty much that, and also 'Australia' followed by a bunch of swearwords."<br><br>But Mr Harada had no say in the matter. Within a week, the visa was arranged, she was on a flight, and Heather McKay was a mailgirl in Harada Industries' office in America. As she had always wanted.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch and his wife were finishing an intimate dinner. The statuesque and athletic Jessica sat elegantly in a long black clingy dress that accentuated her athleticism. Mitch though was nude except for a collar and a leash. "The twins have been out a lot recently," he observed.<br><br>Jessica smiled lovingly at her husband. "More time for us. I'm not complaining."<br><br>"But shouldn't we be interested in what they are getting up to?" Mitch suggested.<br><br>Jessica smiled back. "The eternal question. Should we start to worry now? Should we have been concerned then? Is it too late?" She watched Mitch finish his meal and waited while he placed his cutlery on his dish just so. She smiled dangerously at her man. "I know you are looking forward to it. But before dessert, we're going to the games room." Mitch knew what that meant as Jessica stood and grabbed the leash.<br><br>She accentuated the sway of her hips as she led Mitch to whatever she had planned. He was getting hard. On entering the room, Mitch stopped and stared. Facing him were a number of sex toys on a low table.<br><br>"That's right," Jessica smiled. "We now have a dildo station. I'm sure you will find it..." She paused. "...stimulating." Jessica tightened her grip on the leash directing Mitch right up to the table. She made him stand there as she strutted over to the other side of the table. He looked down at the items. Most of them were new to him, what use he could not tell. Jessica exuded control, as she ever did on these nights. "So let's start with you telling me what the mailgirls have been doing with you in the office," she suggested with a determined look on her face. For whatever reason, Mitch was now fully erect.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Pam Burridge wandered alone through her apartment after her tram ride home. Not having been a mailgirl for long she needed to process her reactions to the job and contemplate the changes in the office. Mitch had seemed reliable and warm. Losing him all of a sudden and getting this new American manager. Not least in her thoughts was that she was naked and vulnerable all day. Alone in her flat she was naked and not vulnerable. She examined herself in the bedroom mirror. Lindsay Davenport had told her to get rid of the bush. Jackson had told her to keep it — if that was what she wanted, it was her body, Jackson said.<br><br>Having not worked in an office before, Pam found she understood little of the other mailgirls' discussions of office power structures, who to butter up and who to avoid especially when alone. She had found she was at a disadvantage. Could she trust Jackson's assertive advice? After all, Lindsay was the boss. She recognised that the original six had started together, stripping to become mailgirls on the same day and had formed quite a solidarity. And the other new starter, Fanny, well she knew what she was getting into from her earlier visits to the office and from her studies into the subject.<br><br>So complicated. To think that she expected all she would have to worry about was walking naked around an office all day.<br><br>Pam had to admit to herself that she was still prudish about the open wanking that went on in the change room as well as in the office proper. Being constantly on display while she went about the office doing her duties was so different to being directed to pose on demand then of course covering up after. She had been shocked at Kimiko's flagrancy in the office meeting, but the others had warned her that Kimiko had no boundaries. She just had not understood what that meant before the meeting.<br><br>Of course Pam wondered if she could have done the same, legs spread and wanking while everyone watched. No, she chose to believe, she just could not do that. She looked again at herself in the mirror. And touched herself just where it started to get sensitive. Maybe? She had panicked for a moment realising how exposed she was in the meeting. But then she had make herself invisible while she calmed down. Still, she wondered. Could she be like Kimiko, just spread her legs in the middle of a gathering of the company's workers and going to town on herself? Or kiss another girl and make out like Lauryn and Jackson? She had watched them with mixed feelings at the time. Mixed about whether she wanted to be one of them. Or would one of the other mailgirls walk up and kiss her. Or even just take her hand away from covering her pussy so that everyone could see. She rubbed and she sighed. She wanted that, didn't she? And now she had warm desires coursing through her body. She knew what she needed to do.<br><br>Pam strode back to her living room and put on a video of the American mailgirls. It took only a moment of stimulation by hand to replace the confusion of her feelings with a carnal strength, as her pussy began to react the right way to the images of beautiful naked women wafting through an office as she worked her fingers urgently between her lips and her clit. She was so close when her phone rang.<br><br>She checked the screen with her free hand. It was Ian Baker. How did he even have her phone number? Had she given it to him when he had caught up with her when she was out of the office that lunchtime. When he had accused her of being a mailgirl. And she had denied it strongly enough to convince. Hopefully. She still worked a finger on her clit.<br><br>She muted the sensuous music accompanying the mailgirls who were now doing something synchronised on the office desks, something not unlike what Pam was doing to herself. To her surprise, she answered the phone. "Yes!" she gasped taking her finger out a second too late.<br><br>"Is this a bad time? Am I interrupting anything?" Ian asked. Pam sighed. It was like he was literally living in her head. But then her welcome may have been a clue.<br><br>"Ian," she said sweetly, now a little more in control of herself, "did I give you my number?"<br><br>"Ages ago when I was an assistant on that photoshoot. You know, back when you were a model. It was my job to find out where you were if you didn't turn up on location on time, so I needed it. Anyway, I hope you don't mind me calling you..."<br><br>"No," she answered cautiously. Would Kimiko keep wanking while she was on the phone? Somehow Pam felt she should keep her fingers away for the moment.<br><br>"Good," he replied. "It was quite amazing running into you again the other week. You know, to find that you are indeed still alive. So I thought perhaps we could catch up, you know, more casually for a bite and a show if you are free say on Thursday."<br><br>"This isn't an attempt to get me back with the old crowd?" Pam asked. She realised that her free hand was back on her clit. Well, she decided comfortable in her own home, this is what a mailgirl does. Clearly the rational part of her brain was not in control. She spread her legs wide, copying the American mailgirls on the screen. And thinking of Kimiko, thinking of everyone watching... She rubbed herself a little harder, slipped a finger in her slit.<br><br>"No," Ian was explaining, "this will just be you and me. With me pumping you for stories about what you have been up to."<br><br>"So long as you feed me well," she laughed, guessing that the stimulation had loosened her up. "And the show better be a good one." At least she would be ready this time, not like when he took her by surprise. Exploring herself with two fingers now, she realised how wet she was.<br><br>"Well it's a date then," Ian answered. He paused and then added "I'll let you finish off what you were doing. See you then." And he rang off.<br><br>"Fuck!" Pam exclaimed as she dug both hands into her crotch. She needed to cum so badly. Humping her hands she fantasised that Ian was in the office, that he had called her to collect a message. She made sure that Ian watched her every move as she strode up to his desk like the American girls in the video, that he watched her as she stood over him, tweaked her nipples and pumped her clit. It worked and she came hard with the overload of the naked mailgirls on the screen and her being a mailgirl for Ian in her head. Satisfied at last. It was much later when she worried where it would all end.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The twins stood outside the rehearsal room on campus. "It's amazing," Emily told Cara. "You enrol in one theatre unit and you get to book Union House for a production."<br><br>"That is so amazing," Cara retorted with her usual cynical hauteur. "Are you going to invite mum and dad to your big production? It would be so great to have the head or former head or whatever he is now of Harada Mailgirl Industries in the audience. And then have someone smart joined the dots to our surname."<br><br>Emily smirked this time. "I think mum and dad need some time alone. If you know what I mean." Winking.<br><br>Cara nodded. "There certainly has been a campaign to get us out of the house. I do wonder what those two have been getting up to?"<br><br>Emily shook her head. "We shouldn't be discussing our parents like that. But you're going to be the director! I'm so glad you're going to help me out. I just couldn't do it without you." She stepped up to her sister and gave her a strong hug.<br><br>Cara shirked her off. "You could have tried Destinee." Referring to the erotic masseuse who apparently knew a real mailgirl. Emily was still still trying to work out how to get the identity out of her. She suspected that it would cost.<br><br>Emily looked at her phone for the time. "We've got the room in fifteen minutes. The others should be here any minute."<br><br>Cara smiled, flicking through the script. "Mailgirl in the Office. One night only, performed on the Uni stage. And it's on a Thursday when no one is busy. If that doesn't bring some real mailgirls out of the woodwork, nothing will."<br><br>Emily smiled brightly. "That was what I was thinking too!" She hugged her sister again.<br><br>Cara went for the high road. "A play that deals with the big issues of the day. Sexual exploitation in the workplace, gender roles in the community and general permissiveness in today's society."<br><br>Emily nodded. "That's right," as she started to greet the other cast members who had all rolled up together. "And it even questions the fundamental nature of work in the modern age."<br><br>"That's right," agreed Rod, a tall student with a goatee who was going to play the boss. "We're going to start the destruction of the capitalist system right here. Melbourne is where the revolution begins."<br><br>"And it begins with women throwing off the bonds of capitalist repression by throwing off the bonds of their clothes in the workplace," Sarah who was playing one of the mailgirls added. Cara gave her a querulous look but chose to say nothing, wondering whether she was being heartfelt or not. As she did high sarcasm too easily, Cara knew how hard it was to distinguish bluster from real belief. But she quietly hoped that they believed. It would make her job much easier.<br><br>Once inside Cara clapped her hands. "I am the director of this production it seems. So let's see how much we know. Let's see if we can run through the whole thing in one go. I'll only stop you if we are going seriously off the rails."<br><br>Sarah raised a hand. "Do we take our clothes off tonight?"<br><br>"Fair question," Cara agreed as she thought about it. "Only if you want to. But of course they'll come off on the night — well except for the nude suits..."<br><br>Emily interrupted giggling. "Nude suits," she chortled.<br><br>"Yes," Cara replied seriously, "nude suits. Why are you making air quotes?"<br><br>"No reason," Emily replied inscrutably as some of the cast smiled at her.<br><br>Cara gave her a warning look and continued. "...so it's up to you to see how comfortable you feel at this stage." She looked around the cast. Emily was already lifting her top over her head.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch used his privileges to select Pam Burridge on his app. Soon enough she strode into his tenth floor office looking controlled if not confident. Although if Mitch had been able to observe more of her journey, he would have seen Pam stride straight through the IT section looking straight ahead, avoiding the staff there. She did not realise her rapid march drew more attention to her from staff who were used to naked women heading along the route to the far office. And now she tried to pose modestly in Mitch's office. Not aware that she oozed sexuality without trying. Or indeed trying not to. Although when he invited her to sit across from his at his desk, Mitch noted that she pushed her chair up close to the desk obscuring herself below the waist as she pressed her arms across her chest to cover as much of her breasts as she could.<br><br>"Do you have a message for me to deliver," she asked dutifully.<br><br>"No," Mitch admitted as he tried to appear calm and unthreatening, "I was hoping to have a chat with you."<br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"When I was the boss, I had regular catch ups with all the mailgirls given that I feel partly responsible for your situation." Rather than answer, Pam sat still and waited for Mitch to continue. "After all, I hired you and put you in this position..."<br><br>"Oh you mean this position," Pam answered suddenly showing some confidence. She pulled her arms back and pushed her chest forward displaying her impressively firm breasts.<br><br>Mitch smiled with the assumption that Pam knew the effect her body had on any lucky viewer. Which made his response a little hesitant. "I guess that's better. I noticed your, um, discomfort in the staff meeting."<br><br>Pam smiled, apparently more nervous than Mitch. "I saw what Kimiko was doing in the meeting, how everyone was looking at her, and I thought 'I can't do that.' That's when you suddenly feel more naked." She shuddered. "I was starting to worry about what I had got myself into... I don't know..."<br><br>Mitch tried to appear managerial. He made sure that Pam had finished her outburst, then tried to look consoling. "No one can do what Kimiko does. And I promise that no one expects that of you. You are only expected to do your job in a way that you feel comfortable. But I was concerned about you in there even before Kimiko started her, uh, performance. I thought that you seemed uncomfortable just being there." Mitch eyed the naked mailgirl who sat back in her chair. She at least seemed more relaxed for having started to discuss things.<br><br>Pam took a deep breath. "Well this may be a surprise, but I have never been naked in front of so many people in one place before." Pam smiled. Mitch nodded as she continued. "Yes, I suddenly got overwhelmed. And a bit frightened." Pam straightened up in her seat, a bit tense. "It's not going to happen again." She looked into Mitch for support.<br><br>Mitch looked back concerned as he tried to reassure her. "Why not? You are human, aren't you? You are allowed to react normally to situations. Of course I would rather that you were not frightened, as you put it. If you're at all uncomfortable..." Mitch tried to keep his caring look as he thought 'If you're uncomfortable, what?' He did not have an ending for that sentence. After all, what could he do? He was no longer a boss with any clout, he could not relate to her experience of being naked and exposed in the office, and he had to admit that he was more comfortable with the forward sexuality of Jackson, Kimiko and the others. This was new to him.<br><br>However, Mitch appeared to have provided the right reaction. Pam sat up straight, rising just a little higher than she had been sitting, more assertive. "I am learning to acclimatise. You know my background, you know I have not been in an office before with or without clothes. All I know about offices comes from watching Steve Carrell on TV." She thought for a moment. "Why did you hire me anyway knowing all that?"<br><br>Mitch gave her a boyish smile. "Well if you must know, it's because you said you were willing to be a mailgirl. And because you turned up to the interview."<br><br>However Pam looked concerned at that rather than assured. She suddenly stood up and turned around so that Mitch could clearly see all her attributes. You could not forget for long that she was extremely attractive. "It was not because of this?" she challenged poking her arse out at Mitch. Then she stopped and got a little coy as she processed what Mitch had just said. "What do you mean by 'turned up'?"<br><br>Mitch smiled up her as she adopted a model's pose, an alluring smile on her face. "You would be surprised — or I don't know, maybe not — by the number of women who agree to a time and then just don't turn up for their interviews, at least in my limited experience. It's one thing to think you can do it and apply for the job. And then a whole different thing to actually come here and face the reality. Look, I'm not going to deny that you are incredibly attractive. That is why you were a model before this job. But you could have looks like yours and also be totally unsuited to be a mailgirl. But you're not. You're here. And hopefully most of the time you are enjoying yourself."<br><br>Pam broke the pose and spun around again, this time faster with a looser swing of her arms. She strode around Mitch's office, back to the entrance and over to the couch where she bent over to tease Mitch with a rear view of her as she ran her fingers along the seat. Reaching the far end of the couch Pam swivelled towards Mitch and sat down, this time with her long legs partly spread and a serious look on her face. She made her mind up and licked a finger then ran it along her slit all the time holding eye contact with Mitch.<br><br>"Do you like it when I do this?" she asked coquettishly.<br><br>Mitch tried to enjoy the lessened tension between them. "I guess I do," he stated like it was normal office talk to make that admission.<br><br>"I'm not sure that I should be doing this," Pam continued as she spread her legs wider to ensure that Mitch could clearly see what she was doing to her slit with her extended finger.<br><br>And yet you are doing it, Mitch mused again seeing evidence that being a naked woman in an otherwise clothed office was a huge turn on for the mailgirls. As if he did not have enough evidence of that. Just that he had not considered it so clearly before.<br><br>"What are you thinking?" Pam cooed, clearly transported by her gentle wanking.<br><br>Mitch smiled while he made up his mind. "That you now seem a lot more relaxed about things than when you came in here," he tried.<br><br>Pam gently fingered around her pussy for a moment longer. "I can do this for ages and never come," she admitted as she stopped. She licked her fingers thinking of Kimiko loudly wanking in the meeting, how she had kept fingering herself when she was talking to Ian on the phone, and she realised that she needed something more than a man sitting behind a desk watching her to get herself to the next level. "Do I get a positive assessment for that?" she asked Mitch as she cat-walked over to sit facing him, this time with her elbows on the desk so that her breasts wobbled close to him as they talked.<br><br>Mitch played along. "Well you know I don't do the assessments any more. But I'm always here whenever you want a chat or to keep me updated on what's going on with you." He felt that was euphemistic enough to include future performances.<br><br>Pam tried to look serious despite being aware that naked her sexual allure would be overpowering. "Do you know yet what Ms Davenport has planned?"<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "She hasn't given me any idea. Except that she has made it clear that she does not like the way I have been running the office. And it's no secret what Mr Harada thinks of my management, so I expect there will be changes. I promise that if I hear anything I'll make sure that you all know as soon as I do."<br><br>Pam got up to leave. "Thanks Mitch, I know that you are a good guy. You deserve to have all these naked women around you."<br><br>Mitch smiled at that. He then realised that Fanny Durack was standing at his doorway. He waved her in. To her surprise she greeted Pam with an arm on a thigh that Pam did not reject. Pam touched the shorter mailgirl on the shoulder and then exited the office.<br><br>"Is everything all right with her?" Fanny asked. "She got rid of the bush."<br><br>Mitch realised that he had not noticed that. "I should ask you, since I expect that you have been interviewing her."<br><br>Fanny came over and sat poised on the corner of Mitch's desk. "True, I've tried. But she hasn't really opened up with me yet. And she seems, is inhibited the right word?"<br><br>Mitch nodded. "We were just talking. She is starting to loosen up. But you have to remember that this is all new to her, completely new in a way that it isn't to the rest of you. She reminded me that she hasn't worked in an office before."<br><br>Fanny raised a leg to display her pussy and smiled over at Mitch. "So she's never been in an office with or without her clothes on?"<br><br>"So it seems," Mitch replied glumly.<br><br>"It was a joke, Mitch," Fanny indicated. He looked at her blankly, so she shook her head at his hopelessness. "By the way I'm here with a message. Lindsay is out somewhere for the rest of the afternoon, so Shane would like you to drop down to his office if you're not too busy."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was pleased to get a smile from Betty Cuthbert as he reached her desk, so he stopped for a chap. "How's your new boss?" he tried.<br><br>Betty gave him one of her dangerous smiles. "She's so sweet. She brought me flowers. And she says good morning every day." Betty gave Mitch one of her sarcastic looks. There were no flowers.<br><br>Mitch tried to play along. "So she is human then?"<br><br>Betty shrugged. "More or less." Then she gave Mitch a conspiratorial look but also checked that no one else was around to hear. "And the Honolulu stopover. She says that she was there on mailgirl business," Betty added.<br><br>Mitch nodded, noting that there was clearly something to find out. "Interesting. I wonder what that could be about?" But he did not expect an answer and Betty Cuthbert did not give him one. "And how is Shane treating you?" Mitch changed the topic. Betty gave him her 'don't go there' look.<br><br>"I'll see myself in," Mitch advised as he went to the deputy's office that Shane had insistently not occupied during the time that he was working for Mitch.<br><br>Mitch found himself just inside the doorway of Shane's new office and trying to manoeuvre around Annette Kellerman who was heading towards the door and shaking her hair back into place when she saw Mitch.<br><br>"I'll just deliver that message to HR," she stammered as she avoided Mitch's gaze. Mitch turned his attention to Shane as Annette exited, pushing her tight, thin body past Mitch. Shane sat on a couch that Mitch knew had not been there before.<br><br>"You're not?" Mitch started once they were alone. "And how did you get that couch?"<br><br>Shane smiled. "It's my thinking place. It's where all my best ideas come to me. That's why I left the other one up there in my old office for you. You should try it. Just close the door, sit there and think. You'd be amazed."<br><br>Mitch stared at Shane. "What, you'd be amazed if a mailgirl just turned up like that?"<br><br>Shane shook his head apparently not getting Mitch's wavelength. "They don't just turn up. You have to page them." He then reacted like he had just realised what Mitch was implying. "Mitch, I'm a married man!"<br><br>Mitch gave Shane a WTF look. "I saw you fucking Heather."<br><br>Shane used his ever-ready boyish smile. "That was a moment of weakness. Now let's talk about Lindsay. There's trouble afoot. She's cancelled the bonus points for the mailgirls."<br><br>Mitch switched from cordial to concerned. "She can't do that."<br><br>Shane looked helpless. "Who is going to tell her?"<br><br>Mitch had to think on that. Could the new boss actually override one of the conditions of the mailgirls' agreement just because she didn't like it? "What about the Fair Work Commission?"<br><br>Shane smiled. "You put a lot of faith in them Mitch. But remember their visit? I am not sure they are strong arm of the law you think they are. And the bonus points. I don't know if it's serious enough to get them involved."<br><br>Mitch had a realisation. "But of course if she can do that and get away with it, then there is no telling what she will attempt to do next." Mitch thought for a while. "Have you spoken to Jackson about it?" She was after all, a former union organiser and she had drafted the contracts and the agreement that the Fair Work Commission had approved.<br><br>"Good idea," Shane blurted.<br><br>Sometimes maybe the couch doesn't work, Mitch mused while Shane worked the app. "Damn," he complained looking at the screen, "she's taken the afternoon off."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Pam Burridge placed her knife and fork down on the plate. "That was a lovely meal, Ian," she smiled. "I've always wanted to eat here."<br><br>Ian smiled at her pleasure. "We must come back." This was starting to feel to him like a relationship. Okay, early days.<br><br>"Now why have you been so mysterious about this show we are going to?" she teased him.<br><br>Ian reached over and placed a hand over one of hers. "It's a student production and it's one night only. And I thought of you as soon as I heard of it. So it's just a short walk from here and it starts in about thirty minutes..."<br><br>"You're keeping something," she giggled.<br><br>Ian let go and turned both his palms up. "It's called 'Mailgirl in the Office,' apparently a fantasy based on what they think goes on behind closed doors." He tried not to look too stressed while awaiting her reaction.<br><br>Pam laughed. "You are obsessed," she chortled. "Well let's go and see what the students think a mailgirl could possibly do."<br><br>It was Ian's turn for a relieved laugh. "Since you're absolutely not a mailgirl you'll be in no position to judge their depiction."<br><br>Pam nodded and giggled again. "Absolutely no position," she parroted hoping that would be enough but suspecting that it wasn't. She was resigned to going to watch this performance with a man she was still getting to know, who seemed to think he knew all about her. But then, wasn't that always the case with men?`

                    content: `Mitchell Johnson lay on the lounge resting his head on Jessica's lap, his hands still bound, the leash hanging down still attached to his collar. His wife rubbed his temple trying to ease his tension. "That session didn't relax you, did it?" she asked him, teasing his semi-hard cock with the tip of her riding crop.<br><br>"I don't know what I need," Mitch admitted.<br><br>"It's the American monster?" Jessica asked gently.<br><br>Mitch smiled. "We shouldn't call her a monster."<br><br>Jessica kissed her husband's forehead. "What then? A gorgon? A banshee?" Her breasts thrust forward, supported by her half cup bra, the strap-on hanging loose on her hips.<br><br>"She hasn't done anything yet," Mitch complained. "Maybe wait and see."<br><br>Jessica shook her head. "That's just you being too kind," she chided him. "What has she done? She replaced you as manager. She has cancelled the incentive points. She is trying to force all the mailgirls to shave clean each morning. Which you know from the States means demerits if they don't do it properly. And she wants to change them from names to numbers."<br><br>"Yeah," Mitch agreed bitterly. "It does sound bad when you put it that way, all of that together."<br><br>Jessica was on a roll. "What is she doing to the rest of the office?" She let the strap-on run softly against Mitch's thigh.<br><br>"Apart from making Shane do some work..." Mitch smirked at that inconvenience for the deputy office manager.<br><br>"I'll have to tell Hollie..." Jessica added sardonically. Which Mitch filed away as confirmed, that his wife did keep in touch with Shane's wife. He was getting properly hard again.<br><br>"...she's reviewing KPIs and setting targets for all staff who don't have them..." Mitch added. He shifted his naked body to get more comfortable.<br><br>"...winning friends..." Jessica adjusted Mitch onto his knees facing her as she sat luxuriously on their lounge. She looked the harsh mistress as she clipped her tight shiny black corset back on. Discarding the bra, it was all that she wore. Her rouged nipples stood out, hard<br><br>"...and threatening to bring in staff from her US office apparently to show us how to do our jobs properly," Mitch added, aware of the incongruity of their measured discussion while they got ready for another round of their games.<br><br>Jessica used the short riding crop to raise Mitch's chin. "So everyone in the office is happy?" She forced his knees a little further apart.<br><br>"Haha, no one. I only wonder whether she — or Mr Harada — have a plan. Or whether she is just doing what she knows." Mitch's cock stood up totally rigid.<br><br>"And your friend Jackson?" Jessica smiled evilly as she stroked Mitch's hardened cock with the tip of the whip. She teased her husband further by spreading her legs, exposing what she was keeping him away from.<br><br>Mitch tried to fight the stimulation. "I haven't seen much of her since The Change. I think she's up to something but I haven't been able to work out what." It did not work. Mitch stayed totally rigid.<br><br>Jessica smiled at Mitch's display. "What did that?" she teased, "me asking about your office wife?" She tapped Mitch's cock with the riding crop. "Well this wife needs some attention," she warned. She stepped close to her husband's face. "Time for you to get to work," she smiled.<br><br>Not long after bringing off his wife, Mitch again rested his head in her lap as she spread out on the lounge. This time he gently stroked her pussy getting her to softly groan as he brought her back down.<br><br>Eventually Jessica gently removed his hand, smiling warmly. "Enough," she advised.<br><br>They lay together for a moment, then got back to talking. "I wonder what the twins are up to?" Mitch wondered. "They've quietened down after the mailgirls flirtation." He could only hope that their interest in that was over.<br><br>Jessica nodded. "I was worried. Emily seriously wanted to be a mailgirl. But I think she has moved on. God knows what Cara wants to be. Maybe you should talk to them?"<br><br>Mitch looked concerned at that suggestion. "And what would I say? 'I'm glad you don't want to be a mailgirl any more, what do you want to be?' And Cara, have you found a profession where you can exploit your mean girl persona?"<br><br>Jessica frowned. "Not sure about that. I think you may need to refine your message."<br><br>Mitch shrugged. "Or we could just ignore it. That's worked successfully so far."<br><br>Jessica worried though. "I preferred it when we were closer as a family."<br><br>Mitch smiled. "Back when you didn't regularly send them out of the house so you and I can play? But don't forget, they're at Uni now. They're growing up. Grown up, in fact."<br><br>Jessica worried further. "And I hope not away."<br><br>Mitch caressed Jessica in sympathy. "Maybe that happens. Okay, let's think of things to do as a family."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>As the audience filed into the Union Theatre the cast acted out a normal — clothed, that is — workday in an office set on the stage. Sarah and Bill sit at facing desks alternating between appearing to work and chatting sociably with each other. Rob, The Boss, looks disapprovingly at them then types something into his mobile phone. A moment later a nude woman dashes across the stage, snatches a sheet of paper from Rob while not breaking stride, continuing off into the wings of the stage and out of sight. A few in the audience noticed because they were vaguely watching the humdrum action in front of them. Too many did not. The audience mood became a buzz of excitement.<br><br>"Did you see that?" a male voice called to someone else from the stalls, but it was too late. The naked woman was gone. Word quickly spread and now more of the audience watched the stage, hoping for a repeat. In the wings, Cara noted that more than half the seats were already taken, ten minutes before the scheduled start. Despite her earlier dire prediction, quite enough of Melbourne had come out on a Thursday night to the Uni to see a student dramatisation that promised to show what happened in a mailgirl office. Emily stood naked smiling at her sister, still puffing after her streak across the stage. Cara handed Emily a robe as she checked the time. "Five minutes," Cara told Emily.<br><br>Out on the stage, The Boss had punched another request into his phone and now looked around frustrated that a mailgirl had not appeared at his request. That tension extended to the audience, those of whom had seen the dash across the stage and expected another one, but especially those who had missed it and had either been told or had overheard others discuss it and did not want to miss it again. Cara looked at her watch, nodded at her sister who handed the robe back to Cara, then dashed out mailgirl style to snatch another sheet of paper from The Boss. She turned and then slowed down to tread the short distance back to the wings. That attracted and quietened the audience. Even though she had walked this time, it had still only taken an instant. So some had missed it again.<br><br>But The Boss held out another sheet of paper for the mailgirl indicating that she was supposed to have collected two from him. Just when the audience suspected that she wasn't coming back, Emily walked slowly back onto the stage, apologetically took the sheet from the admonishing manager and walked equally slowly off the stage to applause and laughter from those watching. Then the curtain dropped and the lights dimmed.<br><br>After a moment's darkness, a spotlight shone on the bare stage frontage. Emily stepped out into the light, now covered in a flashy red velvet robe.<br><br>A wag in the audience called out "Get em off!" Emily smiled and courtesied in response and mouthed "later" to general amusement.<br><br>She waited for enough hush then recited "Oh for a muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest office of innovation! An office for a stage, mailgirls to act, and managers to to behold the swelling scene!"<br><br>Another wag in the audience then loudly continued the chorus, as Shakespeare intended it. After letting him finish to some mild applause, Emily smiled and announced "we're going to have a lot of fun tonight. We will expose the ugly underbelly of late capitalism by showing the attractive bellies — and other parts — of young idealists." That got another round of applause. "Because what better represents the depths that the commercial world will sink, to subjugate its workers by stripping the clothes off some of them — the pretty ones — and then enslaving the rest at their desks."<br><br>That got a lot of hoots of agreement amid further calls for her to get out of her robe. Taunting them Emily held one side of the robe to her body and flashed the other, exposing nothing. She hushed the celebration down and tried to look serious. "Are there any mailgirls in the audience?" she asked with a cheeky grin as she looked out over the rows of people watching her.<br><br>For a moment there was a murmured silence. Then a male voice from near the back called out: "There's a mailgirl here!" Heads turned and Emily peered over trying to see who was calling. "Over here," another voice called, evidently someone near the first revelator. "Here," called the first voice, and this time the person on lighting was ready. They turned a spotlight onto Ian Baker gesturing at Pam Burridge, sitting next to him, as she cringed, towards the centre of the second back row. Ian was smiling. Pam wasn't. But she was literally in the spotlight.<br><br>"I am not a mailgirl!" Pam complained loudly, enough for the hall to all hear. Assuming that this was part of the performance, a fair number of the audience laughed at the vehemence of Pam's complaint.<br><br>Ian got his phone out and knelt dramatically in front of his date. "If you're not a mailgirl, swear it on this YouTube video of Melbourne Mailgirls Go Wild," he urged to again the general mirth of those around them. And the attention of the entire room.<br><br>Pam seemed struck dumb as she stared at Ian's phone, wide eyed and silent. The stranger sitting on the other side of Pam, another youngish man who looked a bit like Ian stared over at the two of them. "She's not swearing. She's a mailgirl!" the stranger declared.<br><br>"Fuck," Pam muttered.<br><br>The audience picked that up, and a good natured chant started. "Mailgirl, mailgirl." Soon, it seemed everyone had picked it up. At Cara's suggestion, the stage curtain went up so that the three actors in their office setting could also watch.<br><br>Pam stood up and raised her hands, gestured to hush everybody. As if that would work. The chanting got louder. Now the centre of attention and feeling no alternative, she pushed along her row to the aisle and then made her way down to the base of the stage. The chanting became applause. In the spotlight, swaying her hips slightly she catwalked at her chosen pace, not to be rushed. She nodded at Emily who beckoned her up. So up she climbed and went over to join Emily to look out at the audience. The chanting of "Mailgirl, mailgirl" picked up again. Pam gestured for the chant to stop and waited for a moment until it did. She stood, wavering a little then took a deep breath. "Okay for the sake of this performance, I am a mailgirl," she announced.<br><br>"I knew it!" Ian shouted out to again widespread amusement. And applause. And a failed attempt to restart the chant.<br><br>Pam stood still in the middle of the stage, forlornly. "For the sake of this performance then," she complained again, clear enough to seem a part of the performance. Worrying about the show stalling before it was supposed to begin, Cara strode onto the stage, took Pam by the arm and sat her down at one of the workspaces. Pam carefully smoothed her dress, appearing not to care that her bare legs were visible up to nearly the top of her thighs.<br><br>Thinking on her feet, Emily advised the room that "our visiting mailgirl will monitor our performance and offer constructive criticism if she thinks we are falling down on the job." She nodded at Pam. Pam nodded at her. She brushed her lanky hair back from her eyes as the stage lights enhanced her features. Even thought Ian had watched her at those photo shoots he was smitten by how gorgeous and self-possessed she was on the stage.<br><br>The lights dimmed and then rose on the actors as the show proper started, with The Boss proclaiming at a bemused Pam about the imminent end of western civilisation due mostly to its decadence.<br><br>"So not global warming then?" she asked.<br><br>The Boss shook his head and looked out to the audience. "No, the decadence," he boomed.<br><br>And the show progressed from there. Sarah sat at her workstation, dressed in sensible office work attire. Bill seemed to be concentrating on whatever was on his PC screen. But he also compulsively stole glances at his phone. The Boss tapped something on his phone. He looked around distracted that nothing had happened then looked over to Pam with some urgency.<br><br>"What do you want me to do?" Pam asks him. Someone in the audience makes the kind of suggestion which she immediately and over-dramatically refused. "Do you boys want a tease," Pam responded. She raised her dress just a little higher up her bare thigh. But clearly she was going no further.<br><br>In the wings Emily turned to her sister. "Jaysus, she's getting more attention that I am. With her clothes on!" Emily whipped off her robe and pushed it to Cara. She thrust her shoulders back, breasts forward. "Deal with this," she muttered.<br><br>Pam was glowing in the limelight, stealing the show while The Boss lectured her about the modern downtrodden worker. Until Emily strode back on stage in a moment later, proudly naked, shoulders back, her firm breasts prominent. She seemed completely unselfconscious about her state. And the audience this time did not have to worry about missing anything. She was taking her time. She slowly snaked across the stage towards The Boss and Pam.<br><br>The Boss stops his rant to glare at the naked Emily. He utters one word at her "mailgirl." It is an order. Emily realises what she should do and kneels in her practiced mailgirl position, shoulders back, breasts forward and knees spread. She faces The Boss which means she pretty much has her back to the audience. Pam looks shocked.<br><br>The Boss ignores Pam and gets out of his seat to slowly circle Emily. Standing over her, he gives Pam a look that invites the still surprised onlooker to comment. "Is that necessary?" Pam asks. She can't work out again why her genuine response again gets laughter from the audience.<br><br>The Boss smiles at her. "The workers have to know their place in the organisation."<br><br>Pam looked puzzled. "But she knows what her place is in the organisation. She has to run around naked delivering messages."<br><br>The Boss sneered. "She has to be constantly reminded of her role. And her status. Look, she enjoys doing it because she doesn't even understand that she is subjugated under the yoke of capitalist oppression."<br><br>"But look at her, she doesn't enjoy being like that," Pam insisted. In the wings Cara grinned widely. This unscripted stuff was even better than what they had planned. Sensing the way the play was going Sarah and Bill kept pretending to be pretending to work.<br><br>"Let's ask her," The Boss told Pam. "Mailgirl 6," he addressed Emily who, trying not to move her head towards The Boss, seemed to be straining to hold her position, "do you enjoy displaying yourself in my office totally naked so that anyone who comes in can see you like that?"<br><br>That caused Sarah and Bill to look up and peer over, firstly curious, then surprised to find that they have a naked woman on the floor near them. Sarah in particular looked seriously interested.<br><br>Emily looked down at the floor. "I enjoy being the object of capitalist subjugation," she recited.<br><br>The Boss looked over to Sarah and Bill and laughed roughly. "I don't even think she understands what she is saying," he exclaimed.<br><br>"Why?" Pam asked.<br><br>"Because if she did she would throw off her chains of repression and rise up to slaughter the parasites of the ruling class."<br><br>"Is that really necessary?" Pam asked, incredulous. The audience seemed to be breaking down to those who enjoyed the archaic Marxist references and those who didn't get the source but thought The Boss's rhetoric was hilarious being so overblown. The few members of the ruling class laughed along hoping not be slaughtered by the end of the show.<br><br>"I certainly hope not," The Boss smiled, since he was clearly one of the ruling class who would be first up against the wall. He turned his attention to Emily. "Now mailgirl 6, I have a message for you to deliver." He went to his desk, picked up a sheet of paper and handed it to the naked mailgirl. She stood up and started to jog on the spot, holding onto the note, her breasts jiggling with the effort. "Deliver it to Rogers," The Boss ordered, off-handedly and Emily jogged off the stage.<br><br>"You see," The Boss told Pam, "the mailgirl knows her place."<br><br>"I don't think anyone would want to be treated like that," Pam argued.<br><br>"And yet you saw what you saw,"Tthe Boss told her. "The money," he hissed.<br><br>Pam looked around the room to check. She was pretty sure that none of the others from Harada were there. None of them would be mad enough to come to a show like this. Pam wondered what she was doing there. Up on the stage! She tried to find Ian, But he was too far back. Anyway, she knew he would be loving this.<br><br>And the show progressed. Emily strolled back onto the stage, gave the boss a note and strolled off, oblivious to any notion that people might stare at her because she was naked. "But that's not real," Pam tried again. "No one would let themselves be treated like that."<br><br>The Boss smiled malevolently at Pam but said nothing. She felt slightly silly having said that given what she did for a living. But there was something about Emily's self confident nudeness. And Pam realised: I do that. I can do that. And she wondered why she ever got embarrassed. Walking around an office naked was so easy. You just had to be confident.<br><br>Silently Sarah got up from her desk and walked up to The Boss who eyed her with amusement.<br><br>Sarah coughed, perhaps a little nervous and addressed The Boss. "I'd like to be a mailgirl." She smiled at Pam, expecting support. Pam looked shocked.<br><br>"You can always find women who want to be mailgirls," The Boss gruffly told Pam. He looked Sarah over, clearly contemplating what he should do with her. Sarah stood still, waiting. "If you are going to be a mailgirl, you better take your clothes off," he ordered. Then he looked over at Pam. "And you have work to do."<br><br>Sarah stepped a little away from The Boss and started to do a striptease, swaying her hips. Appropriate music came up. Sarah strode across the front of the stage, swinging open her jacket revealing a simple blouse. She lifted the hem of her skirt until she was showing the audience a lot of thigh. She shimmied out of her jacket and flung it to Pam who caught it and folded it, placed it on her desk.<br><br>The blouse came off next. Now down to her bra, Sarah revealed her still covered quite large breasts as she unbuttoned her blouse and pushed her shoulders back pushing them forward provocatively, as she slipped it right off. This time, Sarah pranced over to Pam and handed it straight to her. Pam shook her head at Sarah who shrugged a shoulder, marched back to the centre of the stage and wriggled seductively out of her skirt. She was now reduced to her matching black bra and panties, fishnet stockings and garter belt. She danced enticingly for the audience, showing off her assets.<br><br>The Boss waved to cut the music and gestured urgently at Sarah to stop her performance. But he could not stop her prancing around a little more as she started to play peekaboo with her breasts, teasing to release them from her bra. The audience was of course geeing her along. The Boss shushed them. "Being a mailgirl is not a striptease," he thundered.<br><br>Sarah looked surprised. "Well, what is it then?" she queried. And she cheekily flicked a bra strap off her shoulder.<br><br>The Boss glared at her and continued. "Mailgirl is not this cheap titillation. It is the subjugation of the worker to the needs and desires of the corporation. The requirement is that the mailgirl removes all clothes with a minimum of theatre, dispossessed of her possessions and their artifice around her. The aim is that she is naked, not that she gets naked."<br><br>Sarah hung her head. "I see. I am sorry."<br><br>The Boss was not finished. "However, the stripping of the mailgirl is a spectacle regardless. It is necessary that the workers see her transformed from nondescript office girl to naked mailgirl."<br><br>Sarah and Pam both responded with surprise. "Why?" they asked.<br><br>The Boss stood, his hands on his hips. "It is reflective of the situation that exists in the office workplace. Whether the workers realise it or not. All workers are mailgirls."<br><br>The audience laughed. Was it embarrassment? Or maybe just such a cheesy line.<br><br>The Boss ignored that and continued. "The mailgirl taking her clothes off on entering the workplace and performing her functions naked during the day is a metaphor for the unequal struggle of all workers against the power of capital. Marx said..."<br><br>Sarah stamps her foot. "Enough!" she exclaims, shutting up The Boss. She turns to face him and so is side-on to the audience. She unclips her bra and hands it to The Boss, slips down her panties like it's the most natural thing to do in the office and hands those over. She steps out of her shoes and rolls down her stockings, standing for a moment in only her garter belt. She puts her hands on her hips, mirroring the attitude The Boss had earlier shown her. Then she relaxes, slips the garter belt over her hips and down and hands all the rest to The Boss.<br><br>Sarah then curtseys The Boss and turns to give one to the audience who, happy to be given the attention of the now naked woman, give her supportive applause.<br><br>The Boss turns to concentrate on Pam again. "You see how easy it is to become a mailgirl. There's your proof that the workers are only a short step away from all becoming mailgirls."<br><br>"But only the women," Pam argued back.<br><br>The Boss smiled dangerously at Pam and then looked over at Bill who is trying to convince that he is working hard at something. The Boss picks up a sheet of paper. "Mailgirl," he orders Sarah, "deliver this message to Bill."<br><br>Sarah obediently takes the sheet, and strides over, past Pam until she stands close by Bill who is apparently still concentrating on his work. She waits there for a moment but Bill apparently does not notice her. So she coughs. Bill looks up to see that his previously dressed colleague now stands naked in front of him.<br><br>"Wha??" he starts but Sarah cuts him off.<br><br>"I'm now a mailgirl," she announces proudly as he blatantly looked her over. She then goes down on one knee, bows her head and flourishes the sheet of paper from The Boss in Bill's direction. "I have a message for you," she almost needlessly adds as her large breasts wobble right up close to Bill.<br><br>In the final scene of the play, Bill is still clothed despite kneeling in a mailgirl pose as Sarah and Emily kneel the same way on either side of him. Pam is still on the stage, sitting and watching, somewhat aghast as The Boss inspects each of them, adjusting them just a little, first lifting Sarah's chin, then extending Bill's back.<br><br>"This," the boss announces to the room, "is the future of work."<br><br>After a brief silence when it seems that The Boss is right, Sarah glares at him. "You're not a good man," she observes.<br><br>"No," The Boss agrees, "I'm a boss."<br><br>And with that the show ends.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Pam was laughing as she and Ian marched down Lygon Street while he regaled her with her best lines from the show.<br><br>"You're not upset about me turning down the after party?" she asked.<br><br>"Well a bit," Ian answered trying to look sombre about it. "Passing up a chance to hang out with famous actors and get myself known."<br><br>"Men," Pam complained although secretly happy that they avoided the cast gathering where she might get more scrutiny about her proximity to mailgirls than she wanted. Having to explain why had Ian dobbed her in. Men, indeed.<br><br>"That's us," Ian joked, to prove that everything was all right. "How about here?" he asked. They were outside a bar that looked not too full and seemed not to be about to close for the night.<br><br>"Looks fine," Pam agreed so in they went. Ian let Pam go first admiring how she attracted attention from everyone in the place. Even the no doubt blasé barman kept his eyes on Pam a little longer than just a polite glance. She swished her long blonde hair back, just as a model would, creating further fantasies in those watching as she wriggled to be comfortable in her seat., stretching her long bare legs.<br><br>Ian sat down opposite happy to catch the reflection of her radiance. "Drink?" he asked.<br><br>"I think it calls for champagne," Pam grinned. Ian did too. Champagne sounded promising.<br><br>"Thanks for sending me up on the stage," Pam joshed Ian as she enjoyed her bubbles.<br><br>Ian felt carried away by the proceedings of the night and now the champagne. "You went up there because you're a mailgirl," he tried as flat and bland as he could.<br><br>Pam gave him a look of mock horror. "I went up there because I had no option, what with the spotlight and the chanting. Who knows what they would have done to me if I hadn't?"<br><br>Ian gave Pam a searching look. "You seemed to know a lot about the thing. It almost looked like you were part of the cast and your role was rehearsed. Special knowledge?"<br><br>"Oh, you keep trying," Pam laughed. "I had a lot of fun pretending to know something about your obsessions. If I was a mailgirl, do you think I could be a feminist like I was up there?"<br><br>Ian changed his tack. "You seemed very relaxed on the stage. You're a natural."<br><br>Pam swished her hair again and looked around to make sure that others were watching. "I'm used to being the centre of attention," she reminded him. "You know, like when people are taking fashion photos of me."<br><br>"And yet you came out with all that stuff?"<br><br>"Stuff?"<br><br>"All that stuff about how mailgirls should be treated."<br><br>"Common sense really. I mean I know about mailgirls, probably as much as you do. Maybe I have a woman's perspective on this rather than a man's, particularly a man who has spent too much of his time around glamour shoots." Pam stopped herself as she realised his point. "Oh, you were surprised that I was so articulate."<br><br>Before Ian could answer, a hip young man who was sitting with two well dressed young women who were dolled up for a night out came up to their table. Pam smiled radiantly at him. He reassembled himself and coughed politely. "Sorry, you look familiar. I've seen you somewhere," he asserted.<br><br>"The June fashion supplement?" Pam asked sweetly.<br><br>"Maybe," he faltered.<br><br>"What a shame you didn't bring it, I would have signed it for you," Pam smiled.<br><br>Ian nodded his agreement at this offer. "She would have too," he added. The dude returned to his table, to explain to his companions. Pam sipped at her drink as if the interruption did not matter to her.<br><br>Ian returned to his topic. "You really nailed that role up on stage. You would make such a great mailgirl."<br><br>Pam smiled patronisingly at him. "In your dreams. And did you notice that I was the one who kept their clothes on?"<br><br>Ian tried one last time. "Do you think the two girls made good mailgirls?"<br><br>Pam shook her head with a grin. "You're so subtle. You've seen the movies, I'll bet. Everyone has. And you saw them perform tonight. It doesn't look too difficult, you just have to run around naked. Tell me, do you think they made good mailgirls?" Pam kept her thoughts about how hard it could sometimes be to herself. After all, she was enjoying being in clothes talking to a man whom she found interesting. If only he could just let that mailgirl fixation go.<br><br>Ian thought he saw a chance. "They weren't bad. But they're not a patch on you, you know."<br><br>Pam sighed. "They told me that the performance was a protest against mailgirls, if that wasn't obvious by the way we all acted. I assume that wasn't lost on you?" She enjoyed the confusion she had created in Ian, so obvious on his face. She smiled.<br><br>Ian saw a chance. "It's getting late," he advised, "and it's a Thursday."<br><br>Pam nodded at him. "Yes, you can take me home." They both sensed the chemistry between them.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"Still looking for love in the wrong places?" Destinee asked.<br><br>"What makes you ask that?" Jackson replied. She stretched out on her front, naked on Destinee's massage table. Destinee proceeding to thump her back with her fists, alternating between that and squeezing Jackson's shoulders with her strong fingers trying to get the tension out.<br><br>"Well," Destinee replied, "if you were finding love in the right places you wouldn't be here, would you?" Jackson groaned as the masseuse found a severely tight spot and got to work on it. "You're so tense. And it's after midnight," she continued, "and if you had found it — or even just someone to pretend with — you would be tucked up in bed with that warm body so you will be refreshed bright and early when you get back to the office to start your work. You wouldn't be here. And like this."<br><br>"Maybe I just need your expert attention to get the tension out of me."<br><br>Destinee did not buy that. "Maybe you also need this." She traced her fingers down Jackson's back and then between her tight buttocks. Jackson groaned at that pleasantry. Deciding Jackson could wait before she got any more of that, Destinee stopped her progress between her client's legs and gripped at Jackson's firm bottom with both hands. "That working environment of yours certain agrees with you," she admired. "This bottom is all muscle. Impressive."<br><br>Destinee worked her hands there and presently let fingers again find their way into Jackson's cleft and further down. Jackson groaned. "I wish someone else would be impressed," she murmured as she let Destinee's expert fingers work their magic.<br><br>"So how are things going with the boss?" Destinee asked.<br><br>"New boss," Jackson reported.<br><br>"And what happened to the old one?"<br><br>"He sits in a secluded office all day pretending not to be unhappy."<br><br>"You can't cheer him up?"<br><br>"I think he's avoiding me." Jackson had not realised that was the case until she said it.<br><br>"Oh. And the new boss. What's he like?"<br><br>"She. And she's..." Jackson grasped for the right words as Destinee continued to finger her in just the right way. "Something. I don't know," she tailed off, distracted by her increasing arousal.<br><br>Destinee took off her robe so that she was naked too and gently took Jackson by the hand to lead her away from the firm massage table to the bed. "I know what you need," she smiled as she placed Jackson down on the bed and embraced her.<br><br>Destinee held Jackson against her sumptuous breasts. Jackson gripped her hands around the masseuse's neck, surrendering totally to her caresses. Destinee appeared to be still worried about Jackson's state. "When was the last time you looked out for yourself girl?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson knew it was a good question. Along with the other good questions. But for the moment Destinee was working her magic. And that would do.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The function room oozed luxury. Cara reclined on a curved green leather lounge, sipping a cocktail. Sarah planted herself on the lounge close to Cara and smiled at her. She was on the champagne. "Great choice for the after party," Sarah gushed, "it's so plush."<br><br>"You like it?" Cara asked a little too eagerly. "We were lucky to get this private room. It's in demand." She looked around keenly, checking that everything was in order.<br><br>"You can relax now Cara," the actor smiled. "It's all over for you."<br><br>"And for you too," Cara suggested. She tried to relax back in her seat.<br><br>Sarah smiled professionally back at her. "You get to go back to what you were doing before you dabbled in this — not to say that you didn't do a great job because you did. But I have to wait and see what a night frolicking naked on a stage does for my fledgling career."<br><br>Cara looked surprised. "But you're young, attractive and a great actor."<br><br>Sarah shook her head. "I took a chance. You never know what a performance like that does to you. I might be shunned for loose morals or something. Or I might be hired for more of the same, sentenced to take my clothes off on stage if I want to work. Or nothing. I may have to find out how to get work as a mailgirl," she laughed and nodded towards the group nearby.<br><br>Emily was chatting to Rob, Bill and a few members of the crew. She was her usual self, bright eyed and animated while she shared a joke with them. And she was naked. Rob and Bill seemed to act like it was no big deal. Rob looked her in the eyes as he said something quite definite to her, to the amusement of the others in their circle.<br><br>Emily nodded and left the group to head over to Sarah and Cara. She knelt at Cara's feet then spread her knees and arched her back. She looked down at the plush carpet in front of her.<br><br>"Cara, I have a message for you from Rob," she announced.<br><br>Sarah butted in. "Emily, you're not a mailgirl any more," she tried.<br><br>Emily looked up and stared at Sarah plaintively. "But I want to be!" she insisted.<br><br>Cara looked to Sarah, her face saying 'what can I do?' Then she turned back to her sister. "Yes mailgirl, what is your message?"<br><br>"Rob said that he is coming over here to keep an eye on me."<br><br>This was true. Rob led the rest of his group over to where two of the women sat and the other knelt.<br><br>"Such dedication," Rob observed looking down at the naked woman still holding her position.<br><br>"To the cause!" Emily added. She was now shifting around, making eye contact.<br><br>"What cause?" Rob asked.<br><br>"To end the oppression of the working class and the liberation of the proletariat from the capitalist yoke," Emily offered earnestly.<br><br>"Oh that stuff," Rob considered as if he had just heard that sort of talk for the first time. Cara, Sarah and the rest around the room looked on with some amusement.<br><br>Emily though was incentivised. "All that stuff you were saying. I thought you were one of us," she complained. Her breasts heaved with the strength of someone fighting for a cause she believed in.<br><br>Rob gave her piercing look. "I'm an actor," he stated.<br><br>"Betrayed!" Emily cried out. She stretched over and rested her head on her sister's knee. Cara leant down and gently stroked her sister's hair.<br><br>Bill smiled at Cara's sign of affection towards the naked Emily who now gripped Cara's knees so that she could rest her head in her lap. "Ooh, sisters!" he exclaimed.<br><br>Cara looked over and eyeballed him hard. "Not going to happen," she warned.<br><br>Sarah joined Bill's suggestion, egged her on. "Just a little?" she asked.<br><br>Cara turned to her on the couch, wide-eyed. "No!" she repeated. And looked to Emily for support. But all she got from her sister was a non-committal smile. Was she up for it? "Jesus, no," Cara emphatically answered.<br><br>Sarah pretended not to hear that. "Maybe if we get you drunk?" she wondered. And she looked around.<br><br>Bill quickly went to the bar and returned with a glass of champagne which he forced on Cara. And another one for Emily. "To Mailgirls In The Office," he toasted. They all had glasses ready.<br><br>"Long may they deliver!" boomed Rob in his stage voice. And then dramatically drained his glass. The others followed suit and then they all stared at Cara who had sipped hers.<br><br>"To Mailgirls In The Office," Emily ordered her sister who grimaced and then downed the contents of her glass to the delight of the others.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The party went on. Peer pressure meant that Cara had succumbed to Sarah and had finished off a few more drinks. And she was getting louder, at that moment haranguing Rob about whether he actually believed in anything at all. So most of the room had at least one eye on her. Sarah muscled in on them and gave her another champagne, snatching the almost finished previous one away from her before she could complain or react. Cara surprised everyone by giving a Sarah a sloppy kiss on the cheek as she uttered her thanks. Sarah still looked shocked at that as Cara then glided over to her sister who was regaling two of the crew with a story that she thought was funny. Opening ogling her, standing close to the points of her breasts, the crew guys did not want to mess up their moment, a chance of something more with the naked Emily.<br><br>And now they had Cara there in front of them too. Their eyes dilated when Cara wrapped her arm over her naked sister's shoulder. "You were pretty good tonight," Cara slurred, her mouth close to her sister's ear.<br><br>Emily gleamed back at her sister. "Wasn't I?!" she exclaimed. Cara gave her a peck on the cheek and looked lasciviously at the men who were luckily so close to the sisters and were now completely concentrating from only an arm's length away to see what would happen next.<br><br>Cara gave the two of them a glazen look. "What do you want me to do?" she asked like she really didn't know what was possible in her state.<br><br>This was too good to pass up. "The nipple," one of them blurted, hoping to get some action by suggesting tiny steps. Since Cara's hand was already so very close.<br><br>"The nipple?" Cara slurred.<br><br>"Yeah," they both chimed, reckoning that now was the moment as Emily glanced from man to man to sister with wonder in her eyes. The men's hope was obvious. Sister on sister, since the one who had been ordering them around during the production was now drunk as a skunk and up for it. They grinned at Cara and she grinned back, still draped over Emily who started to look concerned at what seemed likely to happen next.<br><br>Cara drooped down towards Emily's naked breasts, her mouth tantalisingly close. And then she suddenly looked up at the men with an evil glint in her eyes. "Do you think I was that drunk?" she snapped at them, a wide grin on her face.<br><br>"Um, well," they both stammered. Cara stood straight up letting go of Emily, clearly as sober as anyone in the room.<br><br>Emily beamed. "That's my sis," she laughed, quite likely relieved.<br><br>Cara smiled at her. "But you were great tonight," she repeated. "Wasn't she boys?" she asked the two crewmen.<br><br>"Yes," they again both stammered as one. They both smiled hopefully at Emily switching their wishes from a sisters show to now wondering again about their chances of getting off with the naked one. She had to be up for it, surely? They both sidled closer.<br><br>Emily held her radiant smiled but created some moral distance with the men. "You know the mailgirls rules, right?" she asked. They shook their heads, looked at each other and then back at her. "No touching, boys," she announced as she stepped back out of their reach.<br><br>Cara, still standing by her sister, was back in director mode. "I'm glad that it was one night only since we pretty much threw away the script when that woman came on stage," she told Emily. Then she turned to the men. "And you too did pretty well to keep up with what was happening." The two of them smiled appreciating the praise, taking whatever they could from a situation that had seemed far more promising a short moment before.<br><br>Emily appeared to now ignore them and gave Cara all her attention. "Do you think she was a mailgirl?" she asked. Then she realised that the whole group had moved over close while Cara was acting drunk.<br><br>Rob, The Boss butted in. "She was pretty opinionated. Gave me a run for my money."<br><br>Emily stuck to her point. "But was she a mailgirl? What are the chances?" she asked generally.<br><br>One of the crew spoke up. "We videotaped it," he told her.<br><br>That encouraged Emily. "Good. I can track her down," she decided. "Did anyone get her name?"<br><br>While others tried to remember if Pam had been introduced, Bill spoke up although he looked to Sarah for support as he did. "I don't know her name but I know her from somewhere. I've seen her face." he scratched his chin trying to draw up the memory.<br><br>Sarah agreed. "I know, she looked kind of familiar." Sarah thought for a moment, then it came to her. "I know, she's been on the cover of... what's it called?"<br><br>Bill smacked his forehead. "Yeah, you're right. She's a model, that explains it." Meantime, Sarah has brought up the cover image she remembered on her phone. And showed it around. Definitely her.<br><br>Which deflated the hopes of the group that they had snared an actual mailgirl. A model, just someone who knew about showing off their body. Oh well.<br><br>The party progressed after that and soon picked up especially as they had a naked woman in their midst and another who although dressed now had been as naked as Emily on the stage. The crew men finally worked up the courage to proposition Emily.<br><br>She pretended to look shocked. "Did I hear you right?" she exclaimed loudly. The others looked over to see what was up. "Just because a woman is naked and delivering messages in this state..." and here she took an assertive pose with her breasts thrust forward and her legs apart and then gestured at her body as if the crewmen needed to be shown where to look, "...it doesn't mean that the mailgirl is instantly available for sex even if she is completely naked with nothing covering this and this and this." She pointed at the obvious bits.<br><br>On a roll now, she continued. "It's just a myth that girls want sex all the time and that they are going to be up to having sex just because they don't have their clothes on. Isn't that right, Boss? The subjugation of the workers and all that stuff." She looked over to Rob with a glint in her eye that she may have borrowed from Cara.<br><br>Rob cocked his head to one side, affecting to examine her state of undress as if it was a sudden revelation to him. "There are a couple of issues to deal with here," he started to lecture. "Firstly there is the mystery of female desire. But secondly, there is the further ramifications behind the enslavement of the salaried class in late stage capitalism leading to their total subjugation. And then there's the intersection of the issues when one or more of the workers are female and totally naked. We can of course make a practical study of the situation," he stated, "since we have to confirm which workers are being subjugated. And if they are up for it."<br><br>Rob looked around and got a round of applause from the males. The women were visibly unimpressed.<br><br>Emily shook her head with intent. "Except that we are not going to do that tonight," she stated definitively. "There will not be a practical study of the situation." And then she put her hands determinedly on her hips as she stood defiant, legs astride. No one dared. The party broke up not long after that.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay Davenport sat behind her desk, very much the boss she kept her distance from the others in the meeting who sat away from her at the small meeting table. It seemed that the new boss of the Australian operation wanted them to know that she ruled. Belinda Clarke, the head of HR, Wendy Turnbull, the mailgirls' supervisor, and Jackson sat at the meeting table. Jackson was of course naked.<br><br>"Explain this mailgirls tribunal to me again," Lindsay asked, apparently frustrated at the concept.<br><br>Belinda looked to the other two then spoke for them. "There are a number of rules about respecting the mailgirls in this office. If these rules are broken — and here I am only talking about minor transgressions — then the mailgirl, or mailgirls, affected can choose to have the matter dealt with by a tribunal of up to three mailgirls with HR and you as the boss of the office in attendance to ensure that due process is followed and that any decision coming out of the tribunal is reasonable and enforced."<br><br>"That all seems unnecessary to me, but you say it's the rules," Lindsay stated. She looked sharply at the group who were crowded on one side of the small round table so they could face her. "So what is the situation that we are dealing with? What has happened to this mailgirl?" she asked with no hint of empathy.<br><br>Jackson shuffled in her seat and looked to the other who now expected her to respond. "The mailgirl affected has permitted me to speak on her behalf today," she started.<br><br>"And I understand, that you will be the sole arbiter of the tribunal?" Lindsay asked her while she stared at a document on her screen.<br><br>"That is correct," Jackson answered, unabashed. "The issue in a nutshell is that Annette Kellerman has reported that one of the programmers, Simon O'Donnell, inappropriately touched her and also said some demeaning and inappropriate things to her."<br><br>Lindsay read from her screen: "He told her that she looked fit and that she should spread herself on his desk so that he could get to know her better. I don't see a problem here."<br><br>Jackson looked to Belinda who gestured that the mailgirl should continue. "That's a paraphrase for official consumption," Jackson offered.<br><br>Lindsay glared at Jackson. "Don't you mailgirls play with yourselves when you are in meetings like this?" she smiled. But not nicely.<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "I can see we are going to get on famously." Wendy gritted her teeth, trying not to smirk. Belinda looked away, over at the ceiling.<br><br>Lindsay kept her malevolent smiled fixed on Jackson. "Please go ahead if you want to."<br><br>Jackson sat up stiffly. "I may if I am in the mood," she responded coldly, "but I am not in the mood."<br><br>Belinda coughed politely so that she could try to get them back to the subject. "We aim to foster respect in the workplace," she tried. "This incident — as reported — was not respect."<br><br>Lindsay concentrated again on her screen. "So this programmer now has to come to a meeting — your tribunal — and confess himself to you?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "No, he attends so that he can hear the mailgirl's side of things and explain himself. Both parties get a chance to explain their positions."<br><br>"And it's presided over by a naked mailgirl. That should be interesting," Lindsay sneered.<br><br>Jackson realised how important it was for her to keep her cool, be diplomatic in the face of Lindsay's hostility and try to seem reasonable about the whole issue. "It should be a learning experience for all involved."<br><br>Lindsay interrupted, stopping any chance of Jackson building on that. "So what are the staff allowed to do to the mailgirls in this place without having to go to your tribunal to be corrected?" she complained.<br><br>Jackson took a deep breath. "With all respect Lindsay, this is your chance to learn how mailgirls works over here. I know it's different to what you are used to. But I hope that you come to listen and observe at the tribunal keeping an open mind about how things work here."<br><br>Lindsay's face reddened. "Have you forgotten that you are a mailgirl?" she snapped. "And it's Ms Davenport." Wendy tried to pretend she was not in the room. Belinda searched for something to lower the heat. She couldn't.<br><br>Jackson held Lindsay's stare. "I know that you are finding things are different here. But you're in Australia now Lindsay. And no, I haven't forgotten." She waved a hand at her obvious nakedness between the other two who were dressed as one would expect for an office.<br><br>Lindsay did not flinch either. "In America you would be a number and I wouldn't even know your name."<br><br>Jackson smiled at her nonchalantly. "Unfortunately, you know my name. Now back to the details about the tribunal," she continued firmly. She was determined to say her piece. She did not mind that Belinda and Wendy had said nothing in her defence. She felt that their presence was enough. At least for this round.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After the meeting wound up, Jackson needed some relief. Avoid her or not, she decided where she was going. Jackson climbed the stairs to the tenth floor and strolled past the IT folk trying not to make any eye contact with any of the programmers. She was too aware that even after the many times that they had seen her naked, they still ogled her. She went to Mitch's office, went in, sat down like it was old times. He seemed pleased to see her and far more relaxed than she was. Jackson told Mitch what had gone on. She realised that despite being naked and alone with the man that she desired, she was not in the mood to tease him, let alone have a wank. She just needed to unwind. Mitch of course would not do anything except be agreeable and accommodate her mood. Jackson tried to read Mitch's attitude to her but failed. He listened to Jackson recount her brush with Lindsay and then told her that he was impressed by her self restraint.<br><br>"What else could I do?" Jackson suggested.<br><br>"Well, you could have blown the place up," he suggested. "Although I don't think that sort of approach is in you," he smiled. Jackson nodded at that.<br><br>They sat silent for a moment. Until Mitch gave Jackson a concerned look. "Have you heard from Heather?" he asked. "I feel I am partly responsible for whatever happens to her there. Since I kept her hopes alive."<br><br>"Since you thought that there was no chance that she could get transferred to the States."<br><br>"Maybe something like that," Mitch agreed trying to not look judgemental about Heather, her looks, her attitude and general antipodean approach to everything. Jackson understood that, she knew Heather only too well, so she too remained discrete, did not push Mitch on the subject.<br><br>But still she was the mailgirls unofficial leader. "We keep in regular contact, at least once a week by email. It's a bit difficult with the time zones, but we're going to facetime on Thursday. Everything seems fine based on what she says in her emails. But don't worry, I'll give her the third degree. Just to make sure that she is good over there. And that she isn't keeping anything from us." I used to get paid half of what I get as a mailgirl to do this sort of work with my clothes on, she pondered. Then she told that to Mitch.<br><br>He nodded. "I don't know what we would do without your skills," he acknowledged, getting a smile from Jackson. "Keep me updated please. Like I said I feel partly responsible so I do care that she's okay," Mitch added.<br><br>Jackson nodded her agreement. Then she felt relaxed enough to be indiscrete. "I wonder what Lindsay does for sex?" she wondered out loud.<br><br>Mitch chose to look shocked at the outburst. He held that look for a long moment. Then they both laughed.<br><br>Mitch started to say something but he was still laughing. "What?" Jackson demanded.<br><br>Mitch composed himself. "I'll see if Shane is trying to find that out. That seems like his department."<br><br>They gave each other serious, knowing looks. Then reverted to giggles. They did not need words for that. And Mitch did not have to worry about his erection.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>In the mailgirls' change room on the mezzanine, Wendy Turnbull sat clothed of course, working on her laptop along with the mailgirls Lauryn, Jan, Annette and Pam who kept themselves busy waiting to be paged. Lauryn and Jan sat, working on their laptops. Annette and Pam rather than that preened themselves in the mirror.<br><br>"So," Annette called over to Wendy, "you have to supervise us in person now?"<br><br>Wendy smiled at her. "Just doing my job," she offered knowing that she had not answered very convincingly. Lauryn and Pam stopped their work to look over.<br><br>"You could do your job like this," Jan suggested, stretching herself straight to show off her pert breasts and of course the fact that she was nude. Wendy rolled her eyes and shook her head. A new, stricter manager or not, the taunting continued.<br><br>Lauryn's app buzzed. She read it, closed her laptop and hurried over to the stairs. A short moment later she jogged back into the room. A few beads of sweat shone on her taut body from her exertion. She slowed down her pace and strode over to Wendy. "Belinda would like to see you," she told her supervisor.<br><br>Thanking her, Wendy closed her laptop and started out to the lift.<br><br>"Not going to take the stairs?" Jan teased. Wendy shook her head but hesitated for a moment. She knew that she really should. Oh well, next time.<br><br>Safely inside Belinda's office, Wendy sat down at the small meeting table and waited for Belinda to come round from behind her desk. "Thanks," she told the Head of HR, "this will give me a break from them for a while. They've been driving me mad."<br><br>Belinda gave her a sympathetic look as she sat close. "Sorry about shifting you down there with them, but orders. I can probably guess what they are doing, but tell me."<br><br>Wendy sighed. "They are hyper about all the changes. And for some reason I'm getting the sense that the others don't seem to trust Jackson any more, so they are pestering me all the time for confirmation about all the rumours that are swirling. And the inspections."<br><br>That got Belinda concerned. "Inspections?"<br><br>Now Wendy lookeed surprised. "Oh you haven't heard? I thought you must have known. I have to do them properly now."<br><br>Belinda shook her head. "Sorry," she tried. "Well, you're safe here for half an hour," she offered a bit brightly, "while we go through things."<br><br>Before Belinda could continue there was a knock at her door. Belinda looked apologetically to Wendy then called out "come in." It was Jan who strode in confidently, a bright look in her large green eyes. She walked up to Wendy saying Hi, as thought she had not seen her for a while. Up close now, Jan thrust her vag forward at her supervisor, so she could clearly see. "Still passable?" she asked as she teased open her labia to show that she was bare everywhere. "But that's not why I'm here," she stated, rubbing her clit. "Belinda, sorry, Lindsay wants to confirm that you have the monthly reports ready for her to review."<br><br>Belinda looked over to Wendy. "Sorry," she told the other clothed woman in the room, "that's why I called you up here, to go through the data with you." She looked back over to Jan. "Could you be an absolute champion and go down to ask Lindsay what's the latest she needs the reports by?"<br><br>Jan smiled "of course," and then gestured at Belinda's device.<br><br>"Of course," Belinda remembered, "it all has to be done properly these days." Jan waited for the beep on her app and set off out of the room.<br><br>Belinda looked apologetically at Wendy. "We'll get this done and then we'll have a chat about your working conditions. She's been keeping me busy too and I really haven't had the chance to check how it's affecting others."<br><br>Wendy nodded her thanks as she brought up the report on her laptop.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Kimiko wandered around the boardroom alone. She viewed each of the large framed photo prints that dominated the boardroom, each one showing a nude or mostly nude Japanese women bound in the way of Kinbaku / Shibari, gifts from Mr Harada to the office designed, in his view, to set the right tone for the business.<br><br>She was studying a muted colour print of a bound woman hanging upside down from a ceiling hook. The woman's hands were tied behind her, her legs were bound uncomfortably together, and her long black hair hung down almost touching the mat on the floor. She appeared to be suspended from a rope that went around her waist and then looped at her crotch.<br><br>Suddenly the door opened. Lindsay Davenport strode in busily and seemed affronted that the room appeared empty. She took a moment to recognise Kimiko down the other end of the room and swept down to her.<br><br>Kimiko looked the taller woman in the eyes, a neutral look on her face. "You asked to meet me here?" she stated flatly.<br><br>Lindsay stared at the mailgirl who despite her nakedness stood assertively in front of her. "Yes, I'm intrigued," she admitted. Her eyes shifted from Kimiko's to the print that had interested Kimiko." She stared at it intensely then looked back to Kimiko as if she was trying to read the mailgirl and give nothing at all away about herself.<br><br>Kimiko held her poker face. "I thought you would be very busy?"<br><br>Lindsay appeared to relax. "I have the time. I thought I would like to get to know you better. We could become friends." She uttered it too dryly to sound like a true invitation.<br><br>Kimiko bluntly answered "I doubt that."<br><br>Lindsay, taken aback, blurted a response, not one she intended. "Well, you're not playing to your racial stereotype?"<br><br>Kimiko coolly asked "do you know who I am?"<br><br>Lindsay nodded. "I understand that you think it gives you some leeway."<br><br>Kimiko shook her head. "That's not how I see it. I signed a mailgirl contract and I am fulfilling the role to the terms of my contract. I am just like any other employee."<br><br>Lindsay smirked and crossed her arms, ruffling her business jacket. "Except that we both know that is not true." Kimiko held her gaze but said nothing. So Lindsay continued. "Good, so we know where we both stand. But I am curious. These photos on the wall, they look like you." She stepped over to the next closest one, a young Japanese woman, turning away from the camera, completely naked with her only restraint being one arm tied behind her back, the other tied uncomfortably above her head to a frame.<br><br>Kimiko did not move a facial muscle. "No. They were a present from Grandad. He's a bit twisted, I know, but he's not that twisted."<br><br>Lindsay seemed genuinely curious. "You haven't had photos taken like this?"<br><br>Kimiko finally broke her stare, confused at the line of questioning from Lindsay. "I am not sure if doing this would mean that I was not naked in some sort of way? It does not seem to be a mailgirl sort of thing."<br><br>Lindsay persisted. "But you have allowed yourself to be tied up by Mrs Ogawa," she stated like she had read Kimiko's personal file.<br><br>Kimiko controlled herself again. "Yes, but I was still petty much naked. You know, my breasts and kitty were not bound, so they were still on display. Like a good mailgirl. As grandad likes."<br><br>Lindsay looked hard at the mailgirl, who faced her so self-assured even without her clothes. "In fact, he'd prefer you not doing this," she reported.<br><br>"I have never been told that," Kimiko responded coolly.<br><br>Lindsay acted like she was being indiscrete for Kimiko's benefit. "I have had hints. But of course there's nothing anyone can do so long as you choose to keep doing this."<br><br>Kimiko looked hard at the manager. "Is that some sort of threat? I am sure that you are aware that the contracts were approved by the government?"<br><br>Lindsay smiled thinly. "I have been reminded of that more than a few times. I guess we will see how well that works."<br><br>Kimiko nodded. "Yes, the bonus points."<br><br>"I suspect that their bark is louder than their bite," Lindsay countered.<br><br>Kimiko shrugged. "Sorry, that is not my department."<br><br>Lindsay nodded back. "Ah yes, you rely on your friend Jackson." She gave Kimiko some sort of evil glint, suggesting that Jackson may not be as relied on as much as before. And added "she was very much in the ascendancy with Mitch. She may have had more sway then."<br><br>Kimiko shrugged.<br><br>Lindsay changed tack, stepping closer to Kimiko as if now she was going to take the shorter, naked woman into her confidence. "Tell me," she mouthed, "I heard a lot about you mailgirls playing with yourselves here all the time here. And obviously your episode in the staff meeting. Yet I don't believe I've seen any of that recently. Do you have something going on? A campaign?"<br><br>Kimiko looked matter-of-fact. "I don't know," she answered, back to her controlled manner. "Can you think of any other reason?"<br><br>Lindsay appeared to ignore that and instead reached at Kimiko's breasts. Only inches away from their target, Lindsay pinched her fingers like she wanted to squeeze the mailgirl's nipples. "May I?" she asked at the last moment.<br><br>Kimiko stepped back and gave her a firm No.<br><br>Lindsay looked surprised at the mailgirl's vehemence. "Is it me?" she tried softly, her hands now carefully at her sides.<br><br>Kimiko shook her head in disbelief. "What do you think?" she asked, a hint of tremor in her voice. She took another backwards step from the office boss. "I think we're finished here," she added, "right?" Getting no answer from a now wary Lindsay Davenport, she left the room.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Kimiko found Jackson with Jan and Lauryn on the mezzanine. She gave Jackson a look then waited until the other two mailgirls got calls. Kimiko then dragged Jackson urgently around to the showers where they had a little privacy to tell her about her encounter with Lindsay.<br><br>Jackson nodded as Kimiko spilled her story and then considered what could be done. "Is it worth complaining?" she wondered.<br><br>Kimiko thought for a moment. "To HR? What do you think?"<br><br>Jackson noticed the unpredictable mailgirl was red in the face. And her stance was stiff. "You're looking stressed," she noted.<br><br>Kimiko looked to the ground. "It's not stressed. I got so horny. But I wasn't going to tell her. I wasn't going to give her the satisfaction. I don't know if she noticed. I don't think so." She looked up at Jackson who read her this time.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Do you need a hand?"<br><br>Kimiko allowed herself a thin smile as she leaned back against the shower wall and spread her legs. "I was wondering when you would ask," she conceded.<br><br>Jackson stepped close to her and licked her fingers. "I'm still not very good at this," she smiled as she traced her wet fingers down Kimiko's tight chest.<br><br>Kimiko spasmed strongly before Jackson's hand reached as low as her navel, her torso shaking with the tension. "Don't tickle," she cried.<br><br>Jackson gave her an evil stare. "It's not tickling," she stated as she repeated her action, starting again between Kimiko's small firm breasts.<br><br>"I don't need that," Kimiko complained and forced Jackson's hand down between her legs.<br><br>Jackson complied and had Kimiko close to cumming almost straight away. "I'm going to need some of that soon too," Jackson groaned as Kimiko pushed dramatically against her hand and then went limp after her orgasm washed over her.<br><br>Kimiko mouthed her thanks and ran a fingernail down Jackson's side. But they were stopped by the sound of a cough. They both turned urgently to look.<br><br>It was Wendy, arms crossed and a wry smile on her face. "You do know that private orgasms are not allowed. Mailgirls have to do it out in the open, at least where they can be seen."<br><br>"I didn't know that rule," Jackson replied, confused since she thought that she knew all the rules.<br><br>Wendy shook her head. "It's a new one. Or rather it's a clarification of a grey area of an old one. You-know-who is making more changes. I have a list."<br><br>Kimiko shrugged. Public displays were her thing. Jackson looked concerned because once again Lindsay had found a way to tweak the mailgirls towards how they were treated in the States.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jan Stephenson bounded onto the tram to take her home. She straightened her slacks as she sat down, happy to find a seat. She smiled as the tram clunked on to its next stop where it really filled up with office types. I look just like them now, Jan smiled to herself as she buttoned her jacket, enjoying feeling covered. She looked at two men in suits who stood near her boasting to each other about some office accomplishments, they barely looked at her. What would they think if they knew that she spent her working day naked in an office tower a few blocks away from them? She laughed out loud at the thought and the two of them looked at her for a moment, shrugged at each other then went back to trying to better each other's achievements. She acted as if something on her phone was hilarious. But this was not Harada Industries. In clothes, on the tram, no one took much notice of the mailgirl after hours. Which suited her fine.<br><br>Opening the door to her apartment, Jan heard music and smelled cooking. Jonathan had clearly arrived home early and started dinner.<br><br>Jan followed her nose to the kitchen and checking that her boyfriend was not holding any sharp objects, gave him a hug from behind. "Hard day in the office?" she asked.<br><br>"Challenging not hard," he replied easily. "How about you?"<br><br>Jan nuzzled the back of Jonathan's neck. "Nothing out of the ordinary," she smirked. "Nothing I couldn't handle."<br><br>Jonathan smiled at that. "I hope there was nothing to handle," he lightly bantered. Knowing what she did, he accepted what went with it, what Jan told him.<br><br>Jan excused herself to go and get comfortable. She returned in a long T-shirt that suggested she was in mailgirl condition underneath it.<br><br>Jonathan noticed. "It spoils the view," he suggested.<br><br>Jan lifted her T-shirt to above her waist for a moment, then dropped it and went up to him to give him a light punch on the arm. "There's plenty of time for that after dinner," she cautioned.<br><br>Jonathan looked at his girlfriend lovingly and then looked around their large, swish kitchen and eating area. "I can't believe we got a place like this."<br><br>Jan shook her head. "You know we can afford it. You're on a good wage with bonuses. And you know what they are paying me. So no money worries." Jan noticed something in his response, changed her tone down. "Are you worried about what I do for a living? Has there been a change?"<br><br>Jonathan gave her a look he hoped would douse that worry. "No, I'm just thinking of the future. And with the rent that we're paying."<br><br>Jan smiled, relieved. "Well, we've got to live somewhere," she pointed out. "So since we can afford it, it might as well be somewhere nice." They were not arguing, just clearing the air.<br><br>Over dinner, Jan decided that she should check that Jonathan was still all right with things. "I have to ask — you know I am going to keep checking — you are still okay with me nude in the office? You know, with all those men — and women — around me..." She tailed off as she looked hard at Jonathan looking for cracks in his apparent acceptance of the nature of her work.<br><br>Jonathan gave her a boyish smile. "At the risk of seeming strange, I find it a bit of a turn on when I think of you naked all day in your office. I mean it's kind of erotic isn't it?"<br><br>"So you're not jealous of other men looking at me?"<br><br>Jonathan looked confused. "No, why should I be? Especially with the benefits at home." He smiled.<br><br>Jan lifted her T-shirt over her head. "You mean when this happens?" she teased. She dropped the T-shirt on the dining table in front of her.<br><br>"You're always ready," Jonathan admired, loosening his shirt.<br><br>"Almost always ready," Jan smirked. She licked a finger and reached to her pussy. She licked that finger again. "Ready!" she announced. Jonathan stood and dropped his pants, and already erect and now with her, he lifted his girlfriend to bend her over the table.<br><br>They were fucking, doggy style. "This is good," urged Jan. "But then it always is!" Jonathan grunted his agreement. "This mailgirl thing turns you on," Jan continued. He grunted, not going to deny it.<br><br>They settled into a rhythm. Then it was Jonathan's turn to phrase his concerns. "Are you tempted to have sex in the office?" he asked, almost coyly. "Uh huh," Jan seemed to say. "You are? You're tempted?" Jonathan teased her. He pulled out and turned her onto her back so that when he started to fuck her again, he could look his girlfriend in the face, studying for her reaction. There would be no hiding. "You're tempted?" he repeated now that he could scrutinise her response.<br><br>Her eyes closed, Jan thrusted back at Jonathan, clearly turned on as he was. Then stopped and opened them for a deep look back in his. "Of course I'm tempted. I'm a naked mailgirl in an office full of properly dressed workers. There would be something wrong if I was not turned on and thinking about it. Why, does that turn you on?"<br><br>Jan pushed Jonathan back onto her chair, her tall, lithe figure straddling him. She let him slip all the way inside her, then raised herself up so that just the tip was in. Smiling down at her boyfriend she swayed from side to side threatening to pull completely away from him. "You're such a tease," he complained.<br><br>Jan smiled down at him as she held her poise but let another inch inside her, raising herself with each one of his thrusts as he tried to get satisfaction. "I'm a good girl in the office, so I can be a bad girl here," she declared. "Now tell me, do you get turned on during the day by the thought of me naked up there in a city tower, surrounded by well dressed men and women?"<br><br>"Yes," Jonathan cried out, over-dramatising. "The thought of you in there naked, available to all your workmates drives me mad!" Jan felt his cock harden against her as she still held back from letting him fully impale her. This was just too much fun, turning her on like crazy. And him.<br><br>Jan smiled with wide, bright eyes as she let Jonathan halfway in. "It's improved our sex life," she laughed. "You want it every night."<br><br>Jonathan took the advantage to thrust deep into Jan as he grabbed her shoulders to help keep him in. "I always wanted it every night. But now you do too," he smiled back. "At last we're compatible." And just after that moment, they both came, moaning together as if to affirm this new-found agreement.<br><br>"Let's continue in the bedroom," Jan decided after a moment as she stood up.<br><br>"You mean," Jonathon joked as he followed her, "that wasn't the end?"<br><br>They found themselves later in the night lying on their backs, holding hands both still zoned out. Jonathan gripped Jan's hand just a little more firmly. "If you were going to fuck one of your colleagues who would it be?" he probed. "One of the fit young men in the stockroom? Or one of the IT nerds I met at the last Christmas Party?"<br><br>Jan chuckled at Jonathan's attempt. "Of course not," she retorted with a slight edge in her voice. "I've already got that in you. It would be one of the sleazy older bosses. That's what turns me on."<br><br>Jonathan laughed comfortably at her response. Obviously she did not mean it. Since the two of them were so good together.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson settled in at the small meeting desk in Mitch's office and at the agreed time she made the connection. Heather bubbled to life, her face filling Jackson's screen, her eyes wide with excitement. "Nude Zoom!" Heather exclaimed. "I know where you are! You're in Shane's office." She licked her lips and jiggled a little.<br><br>Jackson laughed. "It's Mitch's office now," she explained. "Don't worry, it's just you and me. He's out somewhere for the morning."<br><br>Heather laughed. "It's yesterday evening here. I've just had dinner."<br><br>Jackson tried to see what was in the background behind the other mailgirl. "Where are you?" she asked with animation matching Heather's.<br><br>Heather pulled her laptop away from her face, letting Jackson see more of what looked like a swish hotel room. Heather was sitting at a desk. Behind her Jackson could see a large sumptuous bed with a busy, bright abstract painting mounted on the wall. "It's a company apartment," Heather explained, "it's attached to the office tower by a walkway. Very convenient. Apparently Mr Harada stays here in one of them — not this one — when he comes to the States, but I haven't seen him yet."<br><br>Jackson was impressed. "Wow, and they are letting you stay there for how long?"<br><br>Heather smiled big time, Jackson could see the tops of her large breasts shimmering as she explained, rattling on with all her news. "As long as I want. Most of the other mailgirls live here too. We don't have to. Some of the girls live outside and commute in. Now, you're not going to believe this but even if they take public transport all they are dressed in is a long T-shirt that has "Mailgirl" and their number on it in big red lettering. You can't miss it."<br><br>Jackson looked appropriately horrified, given what she had seen of the States on TV. "Does anything happen to them?" she worried.<br><br>Heather laughed, her trademark loud raucous laugh, at the thought of that. "No way, they're celebrities here. Their pictures are on all sorts of stuff. Perfume, naturally. Make-up. Of course clothes are out of the question. Except for the T-shirts. I'll bring you back one."<br><br>They both laughed. "I'll wear it everywhere," Jackson promised. Then she reverted to her type. "Are they covered for Workers Comp for the commute? Are they paid well?"<br><br>Heather looked a bit serious. "That's your area not mine. I don't know anything about that sort of thing. Apart from what I'm paid, of course. But with the set-up here I don't get to spend any of it. So I'm saving. Who thought I'd get rich doing this?"<br><br>Jackson looked surprised. "What, they don't charge you for the apartment?"<br><br>Heather smiled again as she stretched her bare arms above her head. "The apartment is free. But there's one thing..." She dramatically paused waiting for Jackson to catch up with her.<br><br>"What thing?" asked Jackson, cautiously.<br><br>Heather shrugged her bare shoulders. "We're not allowed to have any clothes. We're naked all the time!" She said it like it was the best thing ever. "They have a restaurant. We eat naked, we go to the complex's pool naked, we go to the gym naked, we go through the covered walkway to the office naked. We're naked!"<br><br>Jackson looked concerned, she could not quite grasp it. "What if you want to go out, say at weekends or at night?"<br><br>"The concierge gives us a T-shirt — one of them with "Mailgirl" on it — and a tracker."<br><br>Jackson was not completely convinced. But she tried to seem upbeat. "Sounds great. But how are they treating you generally Heather?" she asked.<br><br>"It's great, you'd love it. Well, you maybe wouldn't love it. But I love it."<br><br>Jackson wondered about going to work mostly naked like a sort of celebrity, proudly showing off her body outside, on the tram, in the street, going in to buy a coffee on the way, and then thought about the reality for her how she dressed for the home to office trip in a blouse, a jacket, slacks or a skirt with the absolute intention to blend in and look like everyone else before she went in through that entrance on Swanston Street and up the lift to the mezzanine to begin her nude work day. Could she be like Heather? She felt a buzz through her naked body as she sat in the office, smiling into the screen on her laptop. Unexplored areas.<br><br>"Tell me all the details," Jackson asked her friend with renewed enthusiasm.<br><br>Heather sensed the change in Jackson and gave her a big grin. "Well, I'm Mailgirl 59. That's my name now. But you should see the office. It's huge, there's an entire building for Harada here, must be 30 storeys or more. And there's an overflow into a building next door. Let me tell you they really need us mailgirls to keep everything running. It's so busy and so many workers. I've lost four kilos. Or nine pounds, as they say here. All the stairs, the gym, and the pool." She stopped for a breath then continued. "Do you know they'd never heard anyone call it an arvo before? Now they're all using it."<br><br>Jackson cracked up at that. "Beaudy bonza," she replied.<br><br>Heather laughed. "Exactly. I'll have to use that one next."<br><br>Then Jackson had a thought about all that nudity. "What about winter?" she asked. "It gets cold there, right?"<br><br>"That's one I can definitely answer," Heather smiled. "They supplied us with full length totally transparent coats. Apparently there's some sort of insulation in them. So you're naked, on display and warm. Isn't that fantastic? Apparently it was one of Mr Harada's pet projects."<br><br>Jackson wondered that Lindsay had not yet mentioned that yet. Well, then she did not yet have them visible in public, naked or not. So far anyway. Maybe Lindsay was planing that? Jackson squirmed in her seat. Lindsay was certainly determined to make the Melbourne mailgirls more like the American ones. She had a pleasant sensation in the back of her thighs, pressed down on the seat. Was the thought of extra nudity turning her on?<br><br>Urged on by Jackson, Heather admitted to the awkwardness of getting used to being called a number rather than a name, the stricter regime around her appearance and the targets for deliveries, no dildo stations, and not being allowed to get herself off unless her boss allows her to. Meanwhile, Jackson almost unconsciously had let a hand wander down between her legs as Heather continued her story. Was it the thought of being naked in the street? Suddenly Heather stopped her narrative. "Are you wanking to my tale of woe?" she asked with a sly smile.<br><br>Jackson said nothing but what she was doing was pretty obvious since she didn't stop.<br><br>"In that case," Heather continued, "let me tell you about all the stuff that they keep secret, that you never see in the videos. First of all, they make us pee in public. It's all about taking our privacy away, that's what the other mailgirls say. The morning inspections are intimate. And I mean intimate. Their version of Wendy Turnbull does a full body check of us, hands on. Fingers across mound and below feeling for any rough patches. And there's instant punishment for any infractions there. Do you want me to go on?"<br><br>Jackson was panting as she worked her fingers deep into her pussy, imagining the touch of foreign hands on her intimate parts, of having to relieve herself in the open and of not being allowed to do what she was now doing wantonly to herself without permission from her boss.<br><br>Heather smiled as she explained the lunch breaks. "We have a special lunch room that used to be a meeting room. Now they have no furniture there apart from chairs around the walls all facing in. The fabrics sit there and eat their lunch. They put our food on a Lazy Susan on the floor in the centre of the room. We have to eat with our faces down and our bottoms up, legs spread."<br><br>"What?!" exploded Jackson who came right at that moment.<br><br>Heather smiled as she watched her friend wank herself to completion. "Oh," Heather gasped suddenly, "you get used to it." She sighed and then took a few short breaths. "Sometimes you want someone to just come up to you from behind..."<br><br>Heather was now bobbing up and down. Jackson realised that something was happening there. Heather gasped as she tried to balance herself. Jackson jumped to the obvious conclusion. "Heather, sorry Mailgirl 59, do you have someone there with you?"<br><br>Heather pulled a guilty face. She kept bouncing, her face becoming flushed, until she admitted a gasped "yes". Heather pushed the laptop back and tipped it down to increase the camera range so that Jackson could see her torso, her upper thighs and a head covered by long blonde hair eating her out.<br><br>"Chrissie, say hello to my friend from Australia, Jackson."<br><br>Chrissie turned around, a grin across her round, high cheeked face. "G'day," she tried in a broad American accent.<br><br>"You're gorgeous, Chrissie," Jackson exclaimed as she got wetter at the sight of this stunning beauty pleasuring her friend. This was too much. She was getting close to another orgasm.<br><br>"She's Mailgirl 38," Heather smiled into the camera at Jackson while she ran her fingers gently through her lover's hair.<br><br>Jackson smiled with a realisation which helped her reach her orgasm. "I didn't know you were a..."<br><br>Heather laughed again. "...lesbian? Neither did I until Chrissie found me looking in vain for a dildo station. Did I mention already that they don't have them here in the States? But they have Chrissie instead, so I'm good." Heather shifted her girlfriend up so that she could kiss her on the lips. The way they looked into each other's eyes, Jackson could tell there was something special there.<br><br>Of course Jackson had Lauryn. But she also had guilty thoughts about how she had transformed from an earnest union official to a naked mailgirl who now had fantasies about taking her job outside the office and walking naked through the streets of Melbourne. And she had a suspicion that Lindsay Davenport might just make that happen.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette knocked and entered Shane's office. He was sitting on his couch. What was he doing? He had his legs crossed under his bottom and his eyes closed. She took a moment to realise that he was in the lotus position. She coughed for his attention, and after a moment he looked over and saw her. His distant stare changed to sharp focus on the lithe mailgirl slinking in his doorway, a knowing smile on her wide mouth.<br><br>"Lindsay wants to see you," she announced.<br><br>Shane shook his legs onto the floor. "But she's only next door," he stumbled.<br><br>"Yes, and she's busy so she summons a mailgirl to get you in there. That is how this is supposed to work." Annette had her hands on her hips meaning her firm, small breasts pointed assertively at the second in charge.<br><br>Shane smiled incongruously at Annette. "Have you got a moment?" he asked and pointed at the front of his pants.<br><br>Annette laughed sardonically. "I have a moment, but you don't. She wants you in there now." Annette strode over to Shane's desk to update herself on his app. "Job done," she stated and strode out.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay looked up from her work as Shane walked in. "Sit down," she ordered, "I need your local knowledge." She went back to concentrating on her screen.<br><br>Shane obeyed. "What for?" he asked carefully.<br><br>"Mr Harada has plans," she stated without looking back up at Shane. "He wants to get our mailgirls on television."<br><br>`

                    title: "Pt. 8",
                    subtitle: "Australian mailgirls resist the new management.", 
                    content: `Looking at her across her desk, Shane Crawford watched his boss Lindsay Davenport closely during their meeting. He wanted clues about her attitude. To be able to predict her. But she barely looked at Shane as she updated him.<br><br>"Mr Harada wants the Melbourne mailgirls on the television. He never liked Mitch's locked convent idea. But I suspect you know that," she told him.<br><br>Of course Shane knew about Mitchell Johnson's aversion to publicity. It was one of the issues that drove Mr Harada to replace Mitch with Lindsay as office manager. And Lindsay showed him that she shared Mr Harada's agenda. However, Shane found himself feeling cautious about the idea. In his role as deputy he was used to being a sounding board, perhaps the voice of reason. Maybe he should now.<br><br>But did his new boss want to hear an opposite view? Oh, well. "What if the mailgirls don't want to be on the TV?" he asked. The Melbourne mailgirls pretty much had things the way they wanted. They came to work each morning and took their clothes off, and after that they pretty much had the run of the place. Shane wondered how they would take the sort of changes that Lindsay was suggesting.<br><br>But Lindsay was not interested. She was blunt. "If they don't like it, they can work somewhere else." Lindsay looked up at Shane and affected to think about it for a moment. Then she smiled dangerously. "No, they can't, can they? We're the only show in town. Except it's been for a closed audience so far. And if Mr Harada likes anything..."<br><br>"...it's publicity. I have been paying attention." Shane knew that about Mr Harada. And no other business in Melbourne had dared introduce mailgirls. They were still the only one.<br><br>Linday honed in on why she was meeting with Shane, she needed his local knowledge. "So which of your local television shows would be the best?" she asked, that being something she did not know.<br><br>"You're not thinking of a six-part Netflicks series?" Shane parried back, vaguely enough that it could be sardonic or a simple suggestion.<br><br>Lindsay missed any disrespect in Shane's response. "No. To start with, I was thinking of more of a current affairs thing. Sensation of the week. We have a show called Sixty Minutes in the States. Something like that."<br><br>Shane decided it would be too difficult to explain to Lindsay that Australia had a show also called Sixty Minutes that was a little different and a little similar to the American one. Instead he made what he thought was a better suggestion. "I can think of the perfect show for that." He went on to explain.<br><br>"Make it happen." Lindsay looked away, back to her PC with an air that suggested she was done and Shane was dismissed. He slowly got himself ready to leave, just about to stand up.<br><br>The door swung open. Jackson walked into the office and straight up to Lindsay's desk. "Mitch sent me with a message for you, Lindsay," she announced.<br><br>Lindsay looked up at the naked mailgirl who loomed over her at her desk. "Don't you knock?"<br><br>Jackson acted perplexed. "No? Should I?" Shane found himself studying the curve where Jackson's bottom swelled from her back. Watching her from his seat, Shane noted how attractively thin she was, how her bottom was taut and was there, right in front of him and on display. He found himself imagining her spreading herself for him which was something that had not happened and, he expected, was unlikely to. She had no interest in him, she had made that clear.<br><br>"We were in a meeting," Lindsay complained.<br><br>Jackson stood there straight backed, affecting subservience. "And I am a mere mailgirl," she pointed out. And noticing Shane's attention in her periphery, she turned side on to him, obscuring his examination of her body.<br><br>Lindsay glared at the mailgirl. "If ever I have you under my control in the States," she threatened.<br><br>"But that's not going to happen," Jackson responded which closed that off.<br><br>Lindsay backed away from her threat. "Okay, what is Mitch's message?" she asked wearily.<br><br>"He wants to know if you are still meeting him at three o'clock?" Jackson responded.<br><br>Lindsay looked irritated, to Shane's delight. "It's in my diary," she snapped.<br><br>Jackson was not fazed by that. "Oh," she responded, "he said that you missed the last one, so he wanted to be sure." Jackson turned and look down at Shane who now seemed uncomfortable. He squirmed in his seat under her stare. "Is it because of me?" Jackson asked since she thought it was that obvious.<br><br>"We were having a discussion," Lindsay intervened, "a private discussion."<br><br>Jackson read Shane's renewed discomfort. Well, Jackson reckoned, if it was that private, she would have to find out what this meeting she crashed was about. The level of discomfort seemed to confirm that. But she pretended that she was not interested in their meeting. Instead she played dumb, pouted at Lindsay. "Can you please note the delivery is complete?" she asked. "You know, rules," she added for extra spite.<br><br>Lindsay marked Jackson off and dismissed her with a wave, deciding that any further sparring would be a waste. There would be a time, she expected, a time when the Australian mailgirls would discover how things really were. That time would come. Jackson gave Shane a knowing look as she strode out of the room. If Lindsay saw that she did not react. Shane got up to follow Jackson out. Of course he was wondering how the office would react to Lindsay's change. And not just the office but the mailgirls. He realised, well he knew, that he liked things the way they were.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Leaving Lindsay's office feeling concerned at what she had walked in on, Jackson stopped at Betty Cuthbert's desk. Betty, who was now Lindsay's PA, concentrated on her screen apparently busy organising something. The naked mailgirl coughed to attract her attention.<br><br>"Sorry I didn't catch you on the way in," Jackson apologised now that she had Betty's attention.<br><br>"The new regime," Betty agreed, grimacing at the mailgirl. Jackson was careful not to flaunt herself at Betty. The PA was one person who could make her feel self-conscious at her state. She felt that she was thrusting her breasts at Betty and showing off the tuft of hair she continued to keep on her pubis just above her labia despite her desire not to. Betty though concentrated on Jackson's face. Why wouldn't she? Jackson clearly wanted to talk to her.<br><br>What if, wondered Jackson. On the other hand, what if she broke through and became overtly sexual with the uptight PA who had only recently started to loosen up with the nude version of Jackson. Betty stared at her, waiting for... what?<br><br>Suddenly Pam Burridge rushed past them with a quick acknowledge and into Shane's office. Betty gave Jackson a querulous look. "Always in a hurry that one," she reported. Hmm, Jackson considered, it appears that way. I wonder why? She filed that thought.<br><br>"Got time for a cup of tea?" Jackson suggested to Betty. That had worked previously in breaking down a bit more of the ice between them. Jackson started to formulate a plan.<br><br>Betty beamed. "Why not?" she replied with more enthusiasm than Jackson expected. But that was good. Pam exited Shane's office and with the barest of nods, again dashed past them. Jackson stepped back from the PA's desk to make room for Betty to join her. But she stopped as Betty stood up.<br><br>"What are those?" Jackson exploded with glee.<br><br>Betty looked down. Then looked sheepishly at Jackson. "Knees," she responded softly.<br><br>Jackson went dramatically wide-eyed. "But I can see them and they are bare!"<br><br>"The weather," muttered Betty while shaking her head. She knew a performance when she saw one. "Some of us dress for the conditions," Betty smiled as she led Jackson to the kitchenette. "Look," she announced turning around, "you can see the backs of my legs too." And she lifted the hem at the back just a centimetre.<br><br>Jackson knew that would make her plan easier. As the kettle boiled, she placed her arm on Betty's and as she hoped, Betty did not flinch at her contact. "They're up to something," the mailgirl declared. "Lindsay and Shane," she added, just to make sure. She let go of Betty feeling that they had a bond.<br><br>Betty nodded. And then looked away, acting to concentrate on the kettle. "Lindsay's freezing me out," she whispered. "She thinks I'm in league with you and Mitch."<br><br>"Wise of her," the mailgirl agreed. They both smiled. The kettle boiled and Betty attended to the pouring. "Did you find out anything about the Hawaii stopover?"<br><br>Betty shook her head with a smile. "Still looking. But, oh yeah, here's the latest. She's got another manager coming over from the States." She read Jackson's expression and got serious. "What do you want me to do?" Betty asked in a surreptitious manner.<br><br>"I have a plan, but I don't want you to get involved yourself. But I need you to do one thing for me." Jackson looked earnest and Betty nodded, waiting for the suggestion. It came straight away. "When Shane is alone in his office, can you call Annette or Lauryn to him with a message? Preferably Annette, if she is available."<br><br>"Sure," Betty agreed looking unconvinced, "but what will that do?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Leave that to me."<br><br>Betty was still unconvinced. "And what sort of message?"<br><br>"They will tell him that Wendy wants to see him," Jackson advised. "When they have finished with him." She lifted her cup to her lips for a sip. And looked over the brim knowingly.<br><br>Betty looked shocked at the implications of that. "You mean!?" she started, wide eyed.<br><br>Jackson smiled sweetly. "I mean nothing, Betty. The less that you know..."<br><br>Betty relaxed back. "...yes I know, the better," she agreed. And then she did something that Jackson did not expect. She reciprocated Jackson's earlier caress of her wrist. But she held on longer. And then she ran her fingers a little up Jackson's arm before she let go. Having detached herself she then retreated into her shell. But Jackson was left to wonder about what Betty was feeling and thinking. And whether she would ever find that out.<br><br>But now she was busy. Jackson had to brief Annette. She found her and Lauryn in the mezzanine with the ever watchful Wendy hovering. Jackson managed to give Lauryn a look which she read correctly. Lauryn called Wendy over to inspect her fanny and expanded their session into asking Wendy for some fashion tips.<br><br>That gave Jackson some time to quickly tell Annette of the situation. Annette gave Jackson a worried look. And then she grinned. "Lovely," she assessed, "so it's transactional now?" It may have been a rhetorical question. But Annette was not entirely pleased.<br><br>Jackson though gave Annette her serious look. "I'm sure it will still work if you just tease him. Go as far as you want."<br><br>Annette shrugged as she dramatically tossed her hair back. "Oh I will. Me, the office Mata Hari." She then gave Jackson a cheeky grin. "What do you think? That I wouldn't say yes? Come on, I'm all in."<br><br>Jackson's app pinged before she could give Annette any further encouragement. She looked at it. Lindsay wanted her again.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The next morning Fanny strolled into Lindsay's office. "You have a message?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay looked up from her screen somewhat stressed. "Which one are you?" she snapped. She found herself staring at the mailgirl's large, round firm breasts which seemed to be pointing straight at her.<br><br>"I'm Fanny Durack," the mailgirl asserted like the boss should know everybody.<br><br>"Don't expect me to remember your name," Lindsay continued in the same tone.<br><br>"It's on the app," Fanny pointed out. "It shows which one you've paged."<br><br>Lindsay clutched onto her lessening control of the situation. "This is the first time you've responded. Where have you been?" But she could not get her eyes off those tits.<br><br>Fanny apparently realised her effect on Lindsay as she rolled her shoulders back a little while she paused to think for a moment before answering. "Away," she smiled. "A combination of study leave, personal leave, and annual leave."<br><br>Lindsay looked astonished. "Heck, we may as well pay you to stay away permanently."<br><br>Fanny shrugged which also wobbled her breasts a little. "Sounds fine by me," she responded politely.<br><br>Lindsay glared at her. "I was being rhetorical. What is it that we give you study leave for? Mailgirl studies?"<br><br>Fanny answered nonchalantly. "Yes, actually. A doctorate. On the introduction of mailgirls to an existing business." She smirked.<br><br>"Well, you're certainly getting first hand exposure," Lindsay sneered.<br><br>Fanny couldn't help widening her grin. "Exposure, very funny."<br><br>Lindsay glared. "Oh, I don't make jokes." Those breasts were really clogging her mind. What was happening to her?<br><br>Fanny remained apparently oblivious both to Lindsay's sniping and her inner turmoil. She stepped closer to the boss's desk. "My research will be of value to the company. I'm looking at the changes it causes to the workplace. Trying to gauge if there is any productivity improvements, the effect on morale. And to assess the differences between the implementations in the States and here. Measuring everything, profitability, length of tenure — how long the mailgirls stay. And the long-term effect on the mailgirls. And on the staff. Mental health, everything." Seemingly she had delivered this explanation before.<br><br>But she now had Lindsay interested in something more than her gravity defying bust. "How are you doing all this?" Lindsay asked, while still trying to maintain some distance, downplay her interest.<br><br>Fanny continued. "Behavioural analysis, surveys, polling attitudes. And HR data."<br><br>"You haven't polled me," Lindsay complained.<br><br>Fanny was still in explanation mode. "It's a random selection. But I'm happy to use the questionnaire to interview you. Let's make a time." She waited but Lindsay did not offer anything. So she went back to her more pressing work. "Anyway, you called me for a message?"<br><br>Lindsay responded offhand, back on safe territory. "Yes, can you find Johnson?"<br><br>Fanny did not get it. "Huh?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay looked at the mailgirl angrily. Then she realised. "You people don't use surnames, I forget. Mitchell. Can you find Mitchell?" Her tone was steeped in sarcasm. "I need to understand his monthly reports. If you find him can you tell him I need him here to explain them."<br><br>Fanny started to turn which jiggled her attributes. Then she stopped. "Ah, okay," she began. Then she thought. "Oh, and when I find him do you mind, can I sit in on the discussion. Monthly reporting sounds like something I could be looking at."<br><br>Lindsay initially reacted against that impertinence. Mailgirls were supposed to be mere messengers. But a sudden recollection suggested that she should give Fanny the access she requested. Something came to her, a memory that Mr Harada had mentioned Fanny's work. So, just in case. Lindsay tried to keep her eyes off those tempting pink nipples topping Fanny's impressive breasts. But she wanted to keep from have to acknowledge the mailgirl's look of triumph. Lindsay looked past Fanny, towards the door to her office. "Well, since you deigned to turn up here today, I guess so," she allowed.<br><br>And with that, the difficult encounter was over, and Lindsay could go back to her work.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After work Jackson sat in a booth, as arranged, waiting. She usually did not find time for self reflection. But here she was, alone, semi-secluded, sipping on her wine and lulled by some inoffensive background music. She began to mull on the day and then on the recent weeks and months. Despite being exposed in ways she had never imagined when she set out on her career, she felt quite happy that she had no strong feelings for any of her clothed colleagues who daily saw her naked. She felt that way too about most of the mailgirls, the exceptions being Fanny who had been a friend before the whole circus started and Lauryn because of their history before.<br><br>And Mitch? Well, she enjoyed teasing Mitch but that was a game like those she used to play with boys rather than out of any fondness for Mitch in particular. Sure, he was clearly and visibly taken with her. She sighed. Was she deluding herself about that? He was married and had a family. But still... What did she really feel for Mitch? Certainly she had been upset for him when she heard about his demotion. And sure, he knew what do to get her off. But what more was there between them than that? He was no longer boss and she had adapted to that, cooled it with him. After all, adaptation was why she was sitting in private in a booth at Jacksons, far enough away from work. And waiting for Lindsay Davenport to show up.<br><br>Jackson mused further as to how she had adopted the spirit of the mailgirl, teasing the workers, playing up to them and expressing herself sexually in ways that she never before thought she could. Her relationships and crushes seemed so tame now. So ordinary. She had surprised herself how easy she found being a mailgirl. Her naked vulnerability was not an issue. She was comfortable. Harada Industries was a safe place to be a mailgirl. And she only gave as much of herself as she felt. Sure she kept an eye on the other mailgirls' welfare, but that was who she was. She cared in her previous job and that made her a good union official. And now she was genuinely concerned about how Heather McKay was getting on as a mailgirl in the States. And how Pam was settling in. But once Jackson finished for the day she could completely uncouple and be another version of herself. Except for now. She looked at her phone as she heard a door open. Lindsay Davenport strode in and came right up to where Jackson was sitting.<br><br>"Nice place," Lindsay observed. "And the name is easy for you to remember."<br><br>Jackson smiled, trying to be agreeable.<br><br>"So good of you to come," Lindsay continued as she busily sat down opposite her. "You don't have to go anywhere in a hurry?" Jackson shook her head and let Lindsay continue. "I thought we'd have a little girls' chat before we go shopping."<br><br>When Lindsay had summonsed her to suggest a drink after work, Jackson suspected that her boss was lonely which would be natural since she was settling in a new country that she presumably had no ties to before her abrupt transfer. Although Jackson did wonder why Lindsay had chosen her. Invited, haha. It was the sort of offer you could not turn down. Jackson wondered if she was the first one Lindsay had tried. But ever curious about people, Jackson politely accepted. And now, she would let Lindsay make the running. Jackson looked at her boss as if she was assuming that Lindsay had not yet finished, and she was being careful not to interrupt.<br><br>Lindsay sensed that. "Since we've finished work for the day," she continued, "we can let our hair down, get to know each other before we head out shopping."<br><br>So Jackson tried. "How are you settling in? Do you like Melbourne?" she asked, trying to appear at least a little animated. But felt a bit silly for being so trite. Not that Lindsay seemed to notice.<br><br>"It's a bit quieter than I'm used to. But I left all my friends back there."<br><br>"You have no one coming to join you?" Jackson realised how little she knew about her boss.<br><br>"That's the fate of the modern executive. You are offered an opportunity halfway around the world and you have to do what's right for the company. And I have to ask, how are you handling your role?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Oh, I cope from day to day."<br><br>"Look, I'm not completely heartless. It must have been a bit adjustment for you."<br><br>Jackson thought about that. "Not really. After the initial, I won't say shock, rather I would say change, after getting used to it, it becomes a sort of routine."<br><br>Lindsay tried to appear impressed. "You seem to get by quite well."<br><br>Jackson chose to play along. "I guess I wouldn't still be doing it."<br><br>"And does it help other things?" Lindsay smiled, hoping to seem interested in Jackson, the person.<br><br>"Other things?" Jackson asked, confused.<br><br>"You know..." Lindsay stumbled, tried a goofy smile.<br><br>"Oh, my sex life." Jackson realised, wondering if this was a strategic intrusion.<br><br>Lindsay leaned forward the way she must imagine friends do when they are sharing deep secrets. "It must be a bit spicy..."<br><br>Jackson found she was continually being taken aback by Lindsay's one sided attempts at intimacy. "Spicy?" Were they on the same wavelength?<br><br>Lindsay had held her forward pose fixed with a smile, trying for that connection which was not quite there. "Are you wearing any underwear?" she asked.<br><br>"You're not very good at this," Jackson retorted. Lindsay lurched back.<br><br>"I thought you Aussies liked to be straightforward," Lindsay recoiled.<br><br>Jackson chose not to read Lindsay's feelings. "I'm being straightforward, you're being offensive. You have to at least try to win my trust first before we try to get intimate."<br><br>Lindsay backed off. "Okay, I'm sorry. Will you let me start again? Sorry," she muttered again, appearing to Jackson to mean it.<br><br>"Why not?" Jackson allowed. She reasoned that since arriving in Australia Lindsay had no options to play anything but the boss with everyone she encountered. Okay, she would give the American a second chance. There you go again, she quietly scolded herself, thinking good of everyone no matter the evidence.<br><br>But Lindsay must have realised what she had done, as she now tried to be more conciliatory. "I'm a boss, and I am kind of boxed into that role and always aware of it. You're a mailgirl. And that's who you are." She smiled at Jackson hoping that was better.<br><br>Jackson crossed her hands over her chest and nodded. "Slightly less offensive. And at least there's an explanation there that makes some sort of sense. But no, I disagree. I'm a mailgirl inside Harada Industries between eight and four-thirty each weekday. Outside of there, I am who I have always been."<br><br>Jackson stared at Lindsay who nodded, although unconvinced. Jackson wondered whether twenty-four hour total mailgirl control was on Lindsay's mind. After all, that was what Heather Mckay was telling her they do in the States. And clearly Lindsay was planning something. Jackson though continued to try to explain herself. "Maybe it's a cultural thing. Here, we are not completely defined by our jobs. Is that how it is in the States? You tell me? When I'm at the gym, I am not at the gym to become a better mailgirl. I am me at the gym, I'm a gym bitch at the gym."<br><br>Lindsay smiled. "Gym bitch? That's an interesting term."<br><br>Jackson smiled back with intent. "When I'm in the zone, don't get between me and the rowing machine."<br><br>But now Jackson was wondering. Was she wrong? When she was in gym, was it so that she could be a fitter, better mailgirl? When she was out with friends, fobbing them off about what she did, was she merely a mailgirl in denial? Was Lindsay right and her identity had already been set? But more seriously, Jackson sensed that Lindsay's aim was to make it an undeniable fact for the mailgirls, to stamp them with that identity. As Heather had described with the T-shirt and the insulation suit. Heather insisted that they were celebrities of a sort in the States. Which Jackson found it hard to credence despite Heather's insistence of the cache associated with the Stateside mailgirls' lower status. Now Jackson was confusing herself. What did she want — and was it that, to become a total mailgirl? She needed to speak to Fanny. Fanny had the psychological insight and could explain that better than Jackson could conceptualise it. But first she had to go shopping with the boss.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson and Belinda Clarke, the head of HR, were arranging the chairs in the big meeting room when Lindsay strode in. They had arranged five chairs in a sort of circle.<br><br>"Not how I imagined a tribunal," Lindsay sneered. She looked around, anticipating some sort of action, expecting more than the two of them.<br><br>"It's not a trial," Jackson responded, possibly a little sharper than she intended.<br><br>Belinda's phone rang. She checked it and headed away for some privacy to take the call. Lindsay strode over to stand close to the mailgirl who was still adjusting the seating, making sure that the chairs were equally spaced in a ring. "You're not hiding anything from me now," she hissed at the naked woman.<br><br>Jackson looked hard at her boss. Then she smiled, recalling Mitch's advice. If only you knew, Jackson thought, saying nothing.<br><br>Lindsay tried to change the mood. "I'm wearing the shoes you suggested," she offered. Then because she could not help herself she added "when you were wearing clothes. I like them."<br><br>Jackson smiled warmly at Lindsay as she saw that Belinda had finished her call and was approaching. "I hope your heels are bleeding," she snapped back.<br><br>But all she got from Lindsay was a grin, a boss's grin. Lindsay turned to Belinda. "Five chairs?" she asked her.<br><br>"Yes," Belinda replied trying to look managerial. "One for Simon, and we're waiting for Fanny. She told me that she would like to observe."<br><br>Lindsay cavilled. "I am curious to see how this goes." She looked hard at the other two. "I'm not expecting much."<br><br>Jackson smiled sweetly. "Then you won't be disappointed."<br><br>Belinda quickly spoke up. "The aim of this meeting is to try to get Simon to acknowledge what he has done and to try to get him to see it from Annette's point of view."<br><br>"And yet Annette is not here," Lindsay observed.<br><br>"Correct," Belinda answered rapidly again, likely determined to keep Jackson and Lindsay from any further sniping at each other, and hoping that Simon would soon arrive. "The aim is to keep the temperature of the meeting down by not having the two of them in the room at the same time at least at this point. We talk to Simon, get him to tell his side of things, explain to him the reasons that Annette initiated the tribunal and then see — with his input — if there is value in sitting them down together later to finalise the matter."<br><br>"I'll say that all seems rather idealistic to me, but I am apparently obliged to see how it plays out," Lindsay sighed. "Now if only this Simon was here. I believe that we were due to start two minutes ago."<br><br>Belinda again tried to create the right mood. "We have only had one tribunal so far. Mitch, Mr Johnson, ran it, and I'm not sure that it was a complete success. Although we have had no more complaints about the area, so I guess something must have sunk in." Belinda was hoping that Lindsay would ask for details about that tribunal to keep her momentum going but at that point there was enough noise at the door to suggest that proceedings were very likely to start. The women found they were standing away behind the ring of chairs when the door opened. Simon O'Donnell came through with a brazen look on his face followed by two other men who seemed equally young and cocky.<br><br>He caught Belinda's questioning look as he approached. "I wasn't going to subject myself to this alone," he asserted. "Brought some support. These two are also from IT. Introduce yourselves, boys."<br><br>"Brian Taylor," one smirked, keeping his hands by his sides. He was being cautious until he stared at Jackson who had moved away from the group. He openly ogled the naked woman, concentrating on her.<br><br>"Mark Richardson, Rich," the other colleague offered holding out his hand to shake with both Belinda and Lindsay. Jackson came back, busy hauling over the extra two needed chairs and making the circle bigger. When she finished, Rich shook her hand too, giving her a smile that might have been embarrassment for her at her state of nakedness. Brian just stared.<br><br>"Sit anywhere you like," Jackson offered apparently not noticing or caring for either Rich's reaction to her or Brian's. "We're going to be pretty informal today, so it's not like we'll be facing each other across a table or anything like that."<br><br>Simon walked around behind the chairs deciding which one he would choose. "Where's the redhead?" he asked.<br><br>It took a moment of confusion for the women to work out what he meant while they all stood unevenly outside the circle. Belinda realised who. "Annette Kellerman. She chose not to come to this session. Although we called it a tribunal, it's not a court of law, it's going to be a discussion about workplace norms today."<br><br>"Oh great," Simon groaned. He leered at Jackson. "So there's only one naked girl here."<br><br>Belinda again found she needed to dampen the tone before there were any sharp words that could derail the discussion. "Yes, for the moment. And Jackson is running the meeting." Belinda's stare suggested that Simon should ease off the smart talk. He took the hint. "Where do you want to sit, Simon?" she asked to keep things moving.<br><br>Simon chose the seat furtherest from the door and Jackson placed herself a seat away from him. Rich planted himself between Simon and Jackson while casting side looks at both of them. He seemed to check with Simon that he was okay with things so far and then he stole a glance at Jackson's firm bust. Brian Taylor took the seat on the other side of Simon as if they were guarding him or something, Jackson wondered. Lindsay sat next to Jackson, and Belinda deciding her depressuring work was done, sat on the other side of Brian.<br><br>Jackson looked around at how the group had settled and then looked over to the door which was closed. "Sorry," she started, "Fanny must be running late. But let's put a few things up first." She looked over at Simon. "This is about you understanding what it is like to be a mailgirl, to get a sense about how we feel in the workplace and how we hope to be treated by the other staff."<br><br>Rich ogled Jackson, for some reason, like Brian had been, he was now brazen. Although he also gave the appearance of considering what the mailgirl had said. He looked over at Simon. "Shouldn't you take your clothes off then, Simon?"<br><br>Simon looked aghast. "What?" He looked to Brian.<br><br>Brian appeared to be thinking about the logic of it. "Get a sense of what it's like to be a mailgirl. If that's what they want you to learn, yeah," he nodded, agreeing with Rich. Both of them kept straight faces as they both turned to directly confront their colleague. Their countenances seemed to suggest that they both thought that was appropriate.<br><br>Simon looked back to Rich who crossed his arms and held his neutral stare. Rich gave Jackson a look which suggested that she should give her opinion. She chose to say nothing. Simon noted Jackson's disinterest with concern and looked to Belinda.<br><br>Belinda crossed her arms. "Whatever makes you comfortable," she suggested. Then she thought for a moment. "Or makes you uncomfortable. Perhaps."<br><br>Rich chimed in. "She makes a lot of sense." He looked searchingly at Simon.<br><br>Simon now was concerned. "I thought I brought you here for support." He looked at both his mates, to either side.<br><br>Brian spoke up. "That's what we're doing. You told us why you had to come here and why you wanted us to attend with you. And now we see that this is a learning process. We'll make sure that you are supported if you choose to do that to understand them better." Somehow he managed to suppress a smirk.<br><br>Rich nodded sagely, agreeing with Brian. "I think it's a good idea. Yeah, you should take your clothes off. To understand." Simon's support team both looked at him earnestly, as if there was only that one way to proceed.<br><br>Simon shook his head. "I don't believe this," he complained. He looked at his colleagues one more time to see if he could read anything new into their stance. But they folded their arms, seemed decided on their view. Simon grumbled something about telling them too much before they came to the tribunal. He gave one final look at each of them. Then he stood up. He unbuttoned his shirt and handed it to Brian. He unbuckled his belt and slid his trousers down. And then his underwear which he folded on his pants to also hand to Brian. Sitting back down he reached down to unlace his shoes and remove his socks which he left under his chair.<br><br>Lindsay looked over to Jackson, agape. "Hold on," she wondered, "what just happened here?"<br><br>Jackson acted cool like it was completely expected, brushing off Lindsay. "Let's start," she stated in a flat voice as if Simon's situation was all in the plan. "A few ground rules. As you can see we are not taking notes or have our laptops or anything. That is so we can say anything we feel we need to with the knowledge that what we say won't be recorded or used in any way later. So we can all speak freely. I will start the proceedings after my Acknowledgement of Country." Jackson looked over at Lindsay who seemed confused. "We are on Wurundjeri land," Jackson explained. She then shared again with the group. "I'll quickly outline why we are here. Then we will hear your side of things. And after that, we'll have a general discussion to see where we land." She looked over to Rich and then to Brian. "And both of you are welcome to contribute as well. I only ask that everyone waits until the person speaking has finished, so no interruptions."<br><br>At that moment, the door swung open and Fanny rocked in at speed. She immediately noticed Simon since he was sitting facing the door. "What's going on here?" she demanded, in some sort of shock.<br><br>Rich was now completely comfortable. "Simon wanted to find out how it feels," he told her. "And you are?"<br><br>"Fanny Durack," she replied. "As you may have guessed, I am a mailgirl." Funny, she considered how they don't notice you are a person until you get them in a situation like this. She was sure that she had delivered messages for all of the males present despite them not recognising her. She felt a bit crafty. "And I am studying mailgirls for my PhD. So watch out." She smiled.<br><br>Jackson looked around the room. "Safe space," she reminded them. "And Fanny behave," she ordered lightly as Fanny took her seat, pretending to be demure but with those large breasts dominating any impression that she may have been trying to make. Lindsay tried not to look at her.<br><br>Chairing the group, Jackson intended to keep a lid on any conflict. She did not have to worry. Sitting there naked, Simon appeared contrite as he concentrated on what Jackson had to say. As she outlined the issue with Annette, Jackson crossed her legs, placing her palms on her knees. Opposite her, Fanny also crossed her legs but placed her hands on the sides of the seat as she listened.<br><br>Rich looked interested and interrupted. "This is new to me," he started. "I'm curious as to why you would become a mailgirl, why you would do it, why some women would choose to be mailgirls in this age. I'm sorry if I didn't make myself clear, do you know what I mean?"<br><br>Lindsay looked at Jackson then spoke up. "Are we getting off the subject here?"<br><br>"I don't think so," Jackson responded. She looked to Rich to continue, to try to explain himself further.<br><br>"I'm trying to understand Annette's mindset leading up to the episode. And how we got there," Rich tried. He looked at Lindsay and addressed her. "With all respect, we are learning things we did not know about the mailgirls. If we had have known, I guess if we properly thought about the women who are mailgirls here — he turned to Simon — we might have acted differently. Sometimes you forget who you are dealing with." Simon sat quietly, his cock flopped to one side, a look of concentration on his face. Apparently this was a learning experience for him too, as Rich had suggested.<br><br>"We?" Jackson asked Rich.<br><br>Rich nodded at her. "We're all to blame. Put three blokes like us together and have naked women wandering around delivering messages and you can easily get some reinforcement of poor behaviour. Banter." He looked around for a response. For a moment no one said anything.<br><br>Then Fanny spoke up. "Can I say thanks, but I am surprised to hear you talking like that?"<br><br>Brian looked into the space in the middle of their circle. "It is hard in the workplace to demonstrate any level of self reflection. The nature of most of our work and the level of general interaction in the office does not allow for it. We seem to fall into established patterns of behaviour. And some of them are not good. Especially the banter that Rich mentioned. It's not always good."<br><br>Simon sensed that he needed to be the next to speak. "I agree with the others," he started. "Having realised from how Jackson has framed it, I'm obviously happy to express my contrition. But can I also point out along the lines that Brian was stating, that my behaviour was in part a reinforcement of learned behaviours in the workplace. The banter thing."<br><br>Belinda spoke up. "We have training in these areas and try to promote an inclusive workplace." That seemed to be for Lindsay's consumption although Lindsay did not give her any response.<br><br>Fanny went again. "Those courses are all good and well, Belinda. But you can see that a lot of that is just window dressing. We can say that we have shown the way that things should be. But we can't guarantee how deep they go. And as the boys say, established patterns of behaviour are hard to break, even if you want to."<br><br>Simon looked approvingly to Fanny. "That's what I was trying to say. To put it another way, you have your work to do, you concentrate on that. And to some extent, when you interact with others in the office, you fall back on what you have learnt to do from before, from outside. Not what is in those courses. They present an ideal. But it's one that doesn't seem natural."<br><br>Rich looked at Simon and smiled. "Next you're going to be saying that your thinking process was liberated by taking off your clothes in this meeting."<br><br>Simon chose to take that comment seriously. "I won't say that is the only thing behind it. But this discussion that we are having now is not the sort of discussion that you do not generally have in the workplace, a genuine exchange of ideas. There just never seems to be the right time or place for it. So yes, I have been liberated, Rich. And I'll be honest, I did not think that things would go like this today. Oh and by the way, I do intend to put my clothes back on when we finish this meeting."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>From his office Shane heard Lindsay slam her door and storm around her office. He made a mental note of how thin their separating wall was. But he stepped out and looked to Betty who smiled back. She smiled further when he gestured that he would go into Lindsay's office and see what was up.<br><br>Being Shane, he strode in with his disarming smile.<br><br>Lindsay glared up at him from her desk although his typical grin quickly turned her flames to embers. "What do you want?" she asked with a show of existential exhaustion.<br><br>"How did it go?" Shane asked.<br><br>Lindsay shook her head. "They think it's a social engineering factory, not a workplace."<br><br>Shane smiled. "You are allowed to swear around me," he offered sweetly.<br><br>Lindsay crossed her arms. "I don't swear. If you hear me say 'damn' watch out." She looked like she meant it but Shane laughed. She shook head slowly maybe realising how silly that sounded. "If this was the States I could punish a mailgirl," she smiled weakly.<br><br>"Or two," Shane suggested. "That would cheer you up?"<br><br>Lindsay shook her head. "I'd be checking their demerits right now," she added sadly.<br><br>"I'm sure you have work to do," Shane suggested, deciding that he had done enough.<br><br>"I'm sure I do," Lindsay snarled, starting to return to her usual self. But then she stopped as her deputy was leaving the room. "Shane," she called to halt him, waiting until he turned to look to her, "thank you." And then she looked back at her screen but only for a moment. Perhaps she could check on the mailgirls anyway.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson and Fanny wandered down the stairs still slightly buzzing. "I never thought it would go like that," Jackson laughed.<br><br>"Maybe you underestimate people," Fanny joshed her.<br><br>"Yeah, maybe," Jackson agreed. The fire door to the mezzanine burst open and Kimiko shot out and raced up past them and out of sight past the next landing.<br><br>"What's got into her?" Fanny laughed.<br><br>"Who knows?"<br><br>They eased through the door onto the mezzanine and wandered into the mailgirls change room. Lauryn was concentrating on her laptop but none of the others were there. Jackson sat down on the bench, stretched her arms up to ease out the remaining tension and then laid her head back, raising one knee for comfort. Soon enough, she was gently rubbing herself around her clit. "Mmmmm," she gasped and then heard the same from right next to her where Fanny was doing pretty much the same thing. They continued their soft stimulation for more silent moments, punctuated by the occasional low groan. Lauryn looked over with a grin, smiling that they were doing it where they could be observed, then went back to her work.<br><br>Fanny looked over to her friend. "Hey," she said. Jackson looked over, her eyes of course drawn to how Fanny's large round breasts pointed almost straight up while she lay on her back. How does she do it, Jackson wondered. Her own pert ones had squashed slightly to each side.<br><br>"What?" asked Jackson dreamily as their eyes met, somewhat glassily.<br><br>"Do you want me to help?" Fanny asked softly. She lifted a hand, wriggled her fingers.<br><br>Jackson kept wanking, letting a nail graze her clit to give her that extra buzz. "I don't know," she simpered back, "it doesn't seem right. You're my friend." Fanny nodded and smiled. They both continued solo, both enjoying the low level titillation of what they were doing, neither in any hurry to actually cum.<br><br>Lindsay Davenport stood at the viewing window outside her Level 6 office. Wendy stood with her. What was Lindsay feeling? She turned to the mailgirls' supervisor. "Don't you wish you were young... and free enough to do that?" Wendy did not expect that from the usually officious boss. But Lindsay was not finished with that subject as she keep her attention on the two mailgirls who were nonchalantly pleasuring themselves. "Of course," she addressed Wendy, "you still are." Yet she did not even turn her eyes away from the performance below to see Wendy's reaction.<br><br>On the mezzanine, Lauryn looked up from her laptop. "Hey you two, can you keep it down? I'm trying to do some PD here."<br><br>Fanny and Jackson both withdrew their hands and looked over at Lauryn from their prone positions. "I didn't realise we were that loud," Fanny smiled.<br><br>Lauryn grinned back. "You weren't. Just thought I'd mess with you."<br><br>Jackson pouted over-dramatically. "Well now you have to come over here and finish us off."<br><br>"Since you've ruined the mood," Fanny added with equal drama.<br><br>"Thanks but I'm good," Lauryn retorted.<br><br>"We could make it worth your while," Jackson continued, even making a cat's claw with her free hand.<br><br>Lauryn shook her head at the histrionics in front of her. "Thanks all the same, but my vag is fine at the moment." She even patted it, which of course did not convince either of the other mailgirls. She looked up at them again, and noticed some movement on the sixth floor. Who was watching them? She tried to look without giving away her interest. Could it be who she thought it was? What had attracted her attention was the appearance of Kimiko between two clothed women. Kimiko appeared to be passing on a message to Lindsay.<br><br>Lauryn was caught in her thoughts now. Should she tell the other two what she saw? No doubt Jackson would be interested. But Lauryn looked back down at the two mailgirls who were again touching themselves. Despite her intrusion they seemed to have had no trouble falling back into their pleasure. Maybe she could tell them about Lindsay and Kimiko later. They were busy. And she had some study to complete.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay returned from ordering at the counter carrying two cups of coffee. She sat down opposite Wendy placing them carefully on the table. "I'm glad you drink full cream coffee. I don't trust anyone who drinks skim." Wendy looked at her boss, mouthing her thanks, trying not to give anything away so early in their catch-up. She had tried during most of her time at Harada Industries supervising the mailgirls to be invisible. That luxury was clearly over. Lindsay launched straight into what she wanted to say. "Did you enjoy watching the two of them at it?"<br><br>Wendy looked confused, so Lindsay got to her point. "All you need to do is what I tell you to. And report everything back to me."<br><br>Wendy was confused. "Everything?"<br><br>Lindsay had got ahead of herself. "I need to know what the mailgirls are up to. And you are in the best position to know. Of course you can choose not to. There are alternatives."<br><br>"I..." started Wendy as she attempted to think through the consequences.<br><br>"I could make you a mailgirl," Lindsay suggested aggressively. She was not to know that that was not the first time that was suggested to Wendy.<br><br>"I could do with the money," Wendy replied. Since ironically she earned less than the women who were under her charge. She even straightened her posture to suggest that although she was clearly older than the cohort who had been hired, she felt that she could hold her own against them in the looks stakes.<br><br>Lindsay recalibrated her threat. "You won't get their money. You'll be on the same wage. Or of course you could leave. Although I understand that there isn't much call for mailgirl supervisors in Melbourne. You could go back to..." She really did not know but assumed Wendy's current role was a step up.<br><br>"Beautician," Wendy informed her tersely. They both knew that was a drop in pay. Wendy looked hopeful. "Well?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay smiled, cat-like. "I'm sure you remember our little chat from the other day. Have you anything to tell me now?" She stirred her coffee and gave Wendy a piercing look.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson was sitting at the meeting table in Mitch's office working on her laptop when Annette came in.<br><br>Annette looked around. "Mitch isn't here much," she observed.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "No, he seems to find things to do which keep him away from the office." She motioned for Annette to sit down with her at the meeting table. "That was quick."<br><br>Annette smiled. "He doesn't last long. I know which buttons to press."<br><br>"Did you pump him?" Jackson asked.<br><br>Annette gave her an astonished look. "Well!" she exclaimed.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Not like that. You know."<br><br>Annette pretended she was having a hard time recalling what Jackson wanted. Then she started: "Oh yeah, silly me. You wanted me to find out what Lindsay has got planned? He played hard to get at first." Annette recounted the conversation for Jackson:<br><br>Shane: I can't tell you.<br><br>Me: What will it take?<br><br>Shane: Be nice to me.<br><br>Me: I thought I was. Aside to Jackson: Since I was bouncing up and down on top of him at the time.<br><br>Shane: Show me some respect.<br><br>Me: I'm doing this with you because I have a thing for distinguished older men.<br><br>Shane: But not Mitch though?<br><br>Me: No, only you. And I gave him a kiss on the cheek. Etc.<br><br>Jackson put her chin on her hand and looked Annette thankfully in the eyes. She even reached over and brushed a lock of her hair off her forehead. "And?" she asked, probing for the news.<br><br>Annette smiled, knowing that she had done well and felt she could stretch out the moment. Then she delivered. "Lindsay is planning to make us public. Mr Harada likes the publicity remember? Shane has got a current affairs team coming out here 'for a visit'. We're going to be on the TV, the full current affairs treatment." Annette gave Jackson a look of concern. "I guess that will be the start." Sure enough Jackson was concerned. "So what can we do about it?" Annette asked her.<br><br>Jackson needed a moment to take it all in. She reflected Annette's worry. "I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. But at least, thanks to you we know and we can get ready. Thanks," she repeated.<br><br>Annette smiled. "It was a pleasure." She then leaned forward with a flicker of concern. "By the way, how did you know?"<br><br>Jackson knew what she was talking about. "Some time back now. The look on your face and your need to clean up after you went there."<br><br>Annette looked horrified that she was so easy to read. "Do the others know? Did they realise?"<br><br>Jackson smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry, you're not the only one."<br><br>Annette's eyes widened. "You?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "No, not me. But I keep my eyes open. If I know what is going on here, I can try to make sure that there are no surprises. Let's just say that some of the others are even less discrete than you tried to be." She smiled. They were friends. At least that was what Annette thought.<br><br>Annette crossed her arms. "I guess I'll have to take that as a compliment. So no ramifications. You're not going to blackmail me?"<br><br>It was Jackson's turn to look aghast. "How well do you know me? Anything you do is okay by me so long as there's no coercion. And to my relief you seemed eager for this mission."<br><br>Annette relaxed back. "Well maybe you don't realise, but it's exciting to be getting up to that in this office. The wall with Lindsay's seems pretty thin." She laughed. "You get a buzz in getting away with it, right there like that. Plus also he's more considerate than you would expect."<br><br>Jackson laughed. "So you and I both get benefit from your mission. Now let's work out what to do."<br><br>Jackson did keep her frustration bottled in that she was unsuccessful in her attempts to pump Lindsay for that information on their excursion. Lindsay had fobbed her off. Lindsay's response was 'we are girls on a shopping trip, so no work talk!' And that was that. Jackson knew she had a weak hand there. After all in her previous career she had been a negotiator. And she knew how it worked, in that situation she had offered Lindsay nothing. So she had got nothing. She had nothing to offer, nothing she could think of.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson waited to connect and soon had Heather McKay's smiling face on her laptop screen again.<br><br>"Hello from America! Same time as last week!" Heather exclaimed, excited as she always was.<br><br>Jackson beamed too. "Do you have Chrissie there with you?" she asked.<br><br>Heather laughed. "Mailgirl 38 is doing her job!" she exclaimed. And tilted her laptop down so that Jackson could see that the American blonde was indeed eating Heather out. "This is the life. You kind of get used to it," Heather continued.<br><br>"Used to what?" As Jackson wondered which life changes Heather was referring to.<br><br>"Having a girl who is taller than you in your bed," Heather responded. She moved a hand down out of sight to caress her girlfriend who had her twitching with pleasure while she spoke with Jackson.<br><br>Jackson looked at Heather, expecting her to continue on about that. But Heather was enjoying herself, pinching her nipples and shifting around to best enjoy her situation, not paying full attention to Jackson. "How tall is Chrissie"? Jackson asked her friend.<br><br>Heather looked downwards. "Chrissie, that's really good but can you stop it for a moment. My friend Jackson wants to say Hi."<br><br>Chrissie got up from her knees. Although Heather was sitting, when Chrissie sat herself next to her, it was clear that Chrissie was seriously taller. And to prove it, Heather nudged Chrissie to get right up and stood up next to her, barely making it as high as her shoulders.<br><br>"Okay," Jackson realised.<br><br>"That's fine," said Chrissie, "I slouch a lot." She bent down to kiss Heather on the mouth.<br><br>"Enough you two," Jackson jokingly complained.<br><br>Heather looked hard at her girlfriend. "Yeah, like she said, enough. She and I have things to talk about. And you've something you have to get back to."<br><br>Chrissie nodded, smiled at Jackson and went down on her knees again to go down on Heather.<br><br>"Is that fair?" Jackson asked her friend now that it was only Heather in the screen.<br><br>Heather laughed. "Don't worry, I'll have to repay her later. With interest. You want to ask me some stuff?"<br><br>Jackson nodded. "I didn't process a lot of what you were saying last time..."<br><br>"You were busy," Heather interrupted. She licked her fingers for emphasis. "There'll be no more of that from you!"<br><br>Jackson rolled her eyes. "I guess... But you said the office there is a 30 storey building? You have to climb that?"<br><br>Heather smiled. "We sure do, as they say here." Jackson looked horrified. "But there are some safety rules. We only have to do a climb of more than fifteen stories once a day at the most unless there is something really serious on. And then a maximum of twice. It's a bit technical. That's the rule when we start from the change rooms on the mezzanine, the set-up here is like our office in Melbourne. Except that here the change rooms are completely glass on every side. Including the street. But like I told you last time we are kind of celebrities here, so everyone expects to be able to see us. We attract quite a crowd watching from outside before nine o'clock while we're getting ready."<br><br>"And you're okay with that?" Jackson worried.<br><br>"Okay? Its great. We have an MC and everything." She put on an announcer's voice. "And now from Melbourne, Australia, it's Mailgirl #59!" Heather went back to her own voice. "Apparently he was standing in the street with his own gear every morning introducing the mailgirls while they showered and shaved, attracting a crowd. Management thought it was such a great idea they hired him."<br><br>Jackson laughed. "I've got to ask, what does he say to introduce Chrissie?"<br><br>Heather looked down to Chrissie who evidently agreed for her to perform. Heather put on her announcer's voice again and started the spiel. "She's from Oakland, California. She was runner-up for National Cheerleader of the Year two years running. And she has one carry-over demerit from last week. It's Mailgirl #38!" Heather called out with due solemnity then dissolved in giggles.<br><br>"Is that all true?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"All true!" Chrissie sang out from between Heather's legs.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "So you all really are celebrities." She regained her poise. "Now fill me in on the details. This walkway from your apartment to the office. Can you be seen?"<br><br>"Of course!" Heather explained that the walkway is pretty much a clear 'glass or something' tube. "So the other workers in the area can see us when we're crossing the road."<br><br>"What?!" went Jackson.<br><br>Heather was matter-of-fact about it since it was her life and she was enjoying it. "Oh, the serviced apartments are in another building across the street from the offices. But the walkway is up above the street, takes us directly into the mezzanine." Then she looked sly. "When there are enough onlookers we sometimes put on a show."<br><br>Jackson again looked concerned. "A show?"<br><br>Heather nodded enthusiastically. "It's good for the brand. Well, Chrissie and I usually go to work together, for a start. So we may put our arms around each other. Or something else. I'll let you imagine. And whoever else is around."<br><br>Jackson looked amazed. "Jazus, what are you becoming?" she wondered.<br><br>But Heather bubbled again, gleeful about that. "A mailgirl!" she enthused, "an American one!"<br><br>From behind her, Jackson heard the door to Mitch's office open. "Hold on," she advised, "someone's coming in." Jackson turned to look. "It's Fanny," she announced into the laptop.<br><br>Chrissie looked up to see, her face now on the screen, screwed up tight. "You're called Fanny?" she blurted.<br><br>Fanny smiled. "That indeed is the name my parents gave me."<br><br>Chrissie couldn't believe it. "You'd get arrested for a name like that here."<br><br>Fanny looked nonplussed. "Says the mailgirl who has to show her totally naked body twenty-four hours a day and lives in a place where she is allowed to walk the streets with nothing on. But you can't say 'Fanny' without getting arrested."<br><br>Chrissie composed herself and smiled a charm back at the Australians on the other side. "Hello Fanny," she recited like it was the best thing in the world.<br><br>"I need to warn you," Jackson butted in, "Fanny does academic studies into mailgirls."<br><br>"I collect everything," Fanny added.<br><br>"She's the one I warned you about," Heather told Chrissie, "she'll get everything out of you. You can't keep secrets with her."<br><br>"I have to ask you because I ask everybody, Chrissie, why did you become a mailgirl?" Fanny started.<br><br>"Oh, you just missed me being outed as a cheerleader. Runner-up for National Cheerleader of the Year two years running, to be precise. That gave me quite a profile. It was going to be the entertainment industry from there for me. I tried out for chorus lines, acting roles, but I was too tall. And I can't sing. So I looked around at what else I could do, applied here and I fit the bill. And before you ask, I see it as a legitimate part of the entertainment industry, so I'm quite happy to do it."<br><br>Fanny mulled on that for a moment. "That's so interesting. Because here we see it as an extension of office work. You may not realise it, but before email and phones, big companies employed people to go around their offices to distribute the mail..."<br><br>"...with their clothes on?" Heather asked with a wink.<br><br>"Indeed," Fanny continued. "And my research has been centred around the mailgirl as a new variety of office worker. And that is how a number of even your colleagues see themselves. But I can see your point of view. The videos..."<br><br>"...the MC introducing us in the mornings..." Heather added. Fanny looked confused. Jackson gestured that she would tell her later.<br><br>"And you don't do anything else around the office?"<br><br>"We just deliver the mail," Chrissie answered brightly.<br><br>Heather turned to explain the Australian office to her girlfriend. "In Melbourne they do a whole lot of other things. Jackson virtually looks after our HR issues, Lauryn who I've told you about still does business analysis when they're busy, and Jan helps out IT. Oh, and Fanny does her research stuff."<br><br>Chrissie turned to camera, looking at the Australians surprised. "When do you get time to deliver messages?" she asked.<br><br>Fanny shrugged. Sometimes she wondered about that too. But at least so far there had been no complaints. She looked to Jackson who had a strange look on her face, trying to appear inscrutable. Oh well. Fanny had something else on her mind. "Now tell me about the demerits," she asked Chrissie.<br><br>But Chrissie shook her head at that. "Heather's such a good girl, she doesn't have any demerits yet."<br><br>"So?" Fanny wondered.<br><br>Chrissie explained. "It's a special part of our mailgirls regime. Heather doesn't find out what happens until she gets five demerits and gets called to see Mrs Danvers. So sorry ladies, that's off the table." Heather looked at her girlfriend hoping no doubt for a clue. But Chrissie shook her head smiling. "No hints." Heather smiled back. Like everything else, that seemed like so much fun.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Betty went into Lindsay's office to see what she wanted. She still felt not right seeing Lindsay sitting where she was used to having Mitch. Lindsay looked up as did the man who was working on his laptop at her meeting table. "Thanks for organising Stuart's access to the building, Betty," Lindsay offered. Stuart barely looked up.<br><br>"He still needs to do the mailgirl orientation," Betty told her boss.<br><br>That got the man involved. "I've worked with mailgirls before. I don't need it," he announced brusquely.<br><br>"But for the access to the app," Betty started.<br><br>He smiled, a set of expensive teeth showing. "I am sure there is a workaround," he snapped like he was so smart he knew these things.<br><br>"I'll see what I can do," Betty murmured, realising the state of things. Then she spoke back more firmly. "Sorry, but your office won't be ready for a few days. They're still doing the wiring on the new floor," she told him.<br><br>"I'll be fine here until then," Stuart stated.<br><br>Lindsay looked indulgent. "Unless I need to boot you out. Are you sure you're not suffering any jetlag, Stuart?"<br><br>"Fine and dandy," he insisted.<br><br>"Good," Lindsay responded. She looked at her watch. "We have the management meeting in ten minutes in the boardroom." She looked to Betty. "Is everything set up?"<br><br>Betty smiled past Stuart at Lindsay. "Oh yes, I sent the mailgirls out to remind the others." Lindsay nodded at Betty who then left the room.<br><br>"There's something about her," Stuart said.<br><br>"Oh yes," Lindsay agreed, "she's still loyal to Mitchell Johnson."<br><br>"And what's up with him?"<br><br>"Oh, he's twiddling his thumbs on the tenth floor. I drag him down every so often when I need to work how he used to do things. You'll like him, he's nice." Lindsay bared her teeth then laughed a little.<br><br>"Nice," Stuart repeated like he too was enjoying the taste of human flesh. "Well, let's not keep the rest of the management team waiting." He stood up, holding his laptop. Lindsay unplugged hers from the desk station and led her new manager out.<br><br>Lindsay and Stuart had kept the others waiting. Lindsay sat down at the head of the table. She presided over Shane, Belinda and Stuart who sat up near her. Down the other end of the table Betty worked at the AV. She pressed a button and suddenly it came to life. Mr Harada's male assistant, as ever in his immaculate suit, appeared on the screen facing Lindsay from the other end of the room. "Mr Harada will be with us in a moment," he announced. The camera there swivelled just quickly enough for the group in Melbourne to see the female assistant help Mr Harada into his chair. And to see him angrily wave her away once he was seated. The more observant watchers — Betty and Shane — also noticed that the assistant's usually perfectly straight black skirt was rucked up at the back.<br><br>"Good to see you, Mr Harada," Lindsay started, to make sure that their boss could hear her.<br><br>The old man stared out at them from the screen. "The whole management team," he noted. "Welcome all. I see you have a new face there."<br><br>Lindsay was about to continue but Stuart butted in, taking over. "Literally my first day here. Flew in last night," he boasted.<br><br>"Stuart is our new Operations Manager," Lindsay boldly announced, taking back the oxygen. Betty sat down a few seats away from the group and started to type onto her laptop, presumably recording the proceedings.<br><br>"I didn't know we needed an Operations Manager," Shane chipped in. He then smiled his trademark boyish smile to diffuse any hint of dissent. But he added "Mitch used to do all that."<br><br>Lindsay gave him her second most condescending smile. "I did a thorough organisational assessment. That was seen as one of the weak points. So I brought in Stuart from our US operation."<br><br>Belinda smiled at the newcomer. "I hope you are settling in," she offered.<br><br>Stuart frowned. "I'm sure I will. I had a few issues already with passport control coming into the country and booking into the hotel. There seems to be some issue with my passport. Not the friendly Aussies I'd been led to expect." He looked around the room somewhat irritated. Something was missing. "Shouldn't we have some mailgirls in here?"<br><br>Belinda was caught by surprise. "Why?" she asked, maybe too sharply.<br><br>Stuart seemed impervious to her tone. "Oh, we always like to have some around in our meetings. Makes the ambience more agreeable. And they fill up our coffees, serve the refreshments."<br><br>"Oh, I can do that," Betty offered, a little worried, maybe professionally slighted.<br><br>Betty then looked around to the others. Lindsay realised that she had better say something to that. "Sorry, Stuart, but I don't think that will work here." She certainly did not want any of the local mailgirls present when the group discussed management matters. She had worked out the danger of that.<br><br>Stuart crossed his arms. "Give me half an hour with any of them, we'll see." The others allowed themselves some laughter. Even Lindsay allowed herself a smile. Stuart smiled back at them, again not reading the tone of the room.<br><br>Shane spoke up. "Sorry Stuart, I didn't catch your surname."<br><br>Stuart turned to him, but stretched back in his seat like Shane was his underling, not the other way around. "Broad," he advised.<br><br>"Can't see any problem there," Shane noted seriously. Then he smiled warmly. "You should try our sports bars," he urged, as blokey as he could be. He and Betty shared a look which no one else in the room read. "They're very friendly, welcoming places."<br><br>Lindsay looked around. "Can we proceed with the meeting?" she asked. And then continued. "We are outfitting level 11 for the engineers. And that's where Stuart's office will be. So he can keep an eye on them." She nodded at Stuart. "I don't even know where they have been working but I want them in one place."<br><br>"How have they taken it?" Belinda asked.<br><br>Lindsay gave her an apologetic look. "That will be for you to find out," she told the head of HR. "Do you know where they have been working?" she asked her.<br><br>"I believe most of them have been embedded with our contractors," Belinda responded.<br><br>"And there have been overruns there. We need to tighten our belts," Lindsay advised. Mr Harada appeared to move his lips, about to comment. But he did not say anything.<br><br>"And the mailgirls?" Belinda asked. "Any changes there?"<br><br>"No," Lindsay replied. "They'll just have an extra floor to service."<br><br>Belinda was sure that there would be more to the issue than that, but that would come out later, not in the management meeting. And not in front of Mr Harada.<br><br>"I think I'd like another coffee," Stuart announced. "Can someone call a mailgirl?" Before she could react, he gestured at Betty that his beverage was not her responsibility.<br><br>Shane offered to call one for him. Don't let it be Jackson, Betty wished. Don't let it be Kimiko, Lindsay hoped. After a few moments, Jan strode into the room, tall and athletic. She was clean shaven, something which Stuart seemed to be checking. She went over to Shane and rubbed his shoulder affectionately. "Yes?" she asked him.<br><br>Shane pointed to Stuart across the table. "Our new colleague would like a coffee."<br><br>Jan rested her hands on the table and leaned towards Stuart. "Coffee," she asked him with a wide smile, "how do you like it?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Wendy got the mailgirls together to impart the news. All seven of them were in the boardroom chatting. Wendy was about to start when Lindsay walked in with Belinda. The boss looked around and sniffed. "Nice atmosphere," she tried amongst the chatter. Belinda sat down amongst the mailgirls.<br><br>"Ladies," Wendy called which brought some silence.<br><br>Seeing that Wendy was at the head of the table and Lauryn had taken the other end, Lindsay chose to stand, incongruously in front of the print of a woman standing uncomfortably with her hands tied with a rope that also wrapped around her ankles. Her bound hands obscured her crotch making the pose almost demure. And the print was almost life size. Lindsay chose not to be distracted by either the print or the jocular attitude of the seven naked women sitting at the board table along with the other two clothed employees. Yet she tried humour at first. "Since you're the most important group on the staff I thought I would give you this news personally."<br><br>No one laughed. Oh well. She explained about the expansion to Level 11 and the appointment of an Operations Manager who would be based there, in charge of amongst other staff, the engineers on that floor.<br><br>Pam looked confused. "We're getting engineers?"<br><br>Lindsay tried to explain. "We've always had them. They just haven't been working in this building."<br><br>Lauryn piped up. "Engineers, the natural enemy of the Business Analyst."<br><br>Lindsay smiled at that. "I thought everyone was the natural enemy of the engineers." But she privately noted the implication that Lauryn considered herself a BA ahead of her job as a mailgirl.<br><br>"So why bring them in here?" Lauryn wondered.<br><br>Lindsay nodded at the point of the question. "I need to keep a closer eye on them. You know what they are like when they are not supervised."<br><br>"Who do we come under in this new arrangement?" Jackson asked.<br><br>Lindsay looked to Wendy. "We all come under HR," Wendy replied. She looked to Belinda who smiled all round.<br><br>"Yes, I'm your manager," Belinda confirmed. It seemed odd in some ways but they were generally happy with that. She was not aware that Lindsay had initially placed them under Stuart but had hastily revised that having seen his attitude. She had decided that the inevitable conflict was not worth it. At least not yet.<br><br>Of course they all had further points to raise. Fanny took her turn. "I can imagine issues with engineers," she started. "I hope that they are not going to be blokey, if you know what I mean. You know, the stereotype."<br><br>Belinda opened her laptop. "I have the stats," she replied. "There are twenty-one of them, only one female."<br><br>"That will change over time," Lindsay offered confidently.<br><br>Belinda looked around the table. "We should have a mailgirl induction session for them. It's a big change."<br><br>Lindsay shook her head. "I'm more inclined to let them loose and see what happens."<br><br>Jackson looked surprised. "I'm not sure if you're joking, Lindsay. But who knows, it may turn out all right. However, Lindsay, you do have governance responsibilities. If anything happens, you are personally responsible if you haven't done something along the lines of at least making them aware of their behavioural expectations."<br><br>Lindsay looked surprised. "I thought that sort of liability was a States thing. You're all collective responsibility here, I thought."<br><br>Jackson folded her arms, now well into management bargaining mode. "Well there are laws. Which admittedly haven't been tested. You can take your chances with them, I guess, see what the courts say about your fiduciary responsibilities." She smiled with that challenge.<br><br>Lindsay smiled back. "Okay, you've made your point. Let's give the engineers their mailgirl induction. I guess you and Belinda have some ideas."<br><br>Belinda turned to Lindsay. "We're working on it. I'll have a draft to you this afternoon." She sighed. "It's a proper presentation thing, not the on-line one that Stuart chose not to do." There was a murmur around the table at that revelation.<br><br>Lindsay took a breath. Why did Belinda have to mention that now? "Oh, one other thing," she started because it had to be told, "we're having a TV crew here on Tuesday. They are doing a story on mailgirls in Australia. Needless to say, look your best. And remember that you will be ambassadors for the company." She hoped that was not seen as a challenge. Lindsay glanced carefully at Kimiko, but she seemed to be disinterested, like she saw it as inevitable.<br><br>But that revelation raised the chatter amongst the mailgirls. They fired questions at Lindsay. Do we have to appear? What do they want with us? Whose idea was it? Lindsay hushed them down. Although she noticed that Jackson and Annette had remained silent, almost disinterested in wanting details like the others. Kimiko also kept silent. But Lindsay did not like the look on her face.<br><br>After waiting for the chance to be heard, Lindsay explained the situation further. "Shane is handling the logistics of the visit. So he has all the details. But I can tell you what I know. They will be interviewing me and one other, probably Shane. Then they will be filming some footage around the office. I am sure that they will be friendly and happy to talk to you if you want to talk to them."<br><br>The group looked around at each other unsure how to pursue it. Jackson eventually spoke up. "So the details?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay closed her down. "I'll make sure that they go out in an email," she offered. And then since she was standing, it was easy for her to make an exit, having said what she intended.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay strode down Lygon Street as Jackson raced to keep up with her, panting. Lindsay had surprised her with her fast gait and evident endurance. The mailgirl thought she was in good condition. But she was no match for her boss. Lindsay stopped and waited for Jackson to catch up before they could cross at the lights, waiting for the red man to turn green.<br><br>To catch her breath, Jackson grasped Lindsay lightly by the sleeve. "I still don't know what we're doing here, this," she panted.<br><br>Lindsay smiled back. "Relax, you're on company time."<br><br>Jackson bit back at that while sucking in air. "Oh, so the company pays me to be your friend. Now I understand." Anyone watching would not see any warmth at all between the two women.<br><br>Lindsay gave Jackson her managerial stare. "I'm sure you'll come around. We're more alike than you realise," she advised.<br><br>Jackson was having none of that. "I doubt it." She looked studiously at Lindsay, failing to find any points of similarity.<br><br>Lindsay believed in what she had said though. "We're both born leaders, fighting the glass ceilings in a male dominated world," she pronounced.<br><br>They crossed the road with Jackson still complaining as Lindsay picked up her pace. "If that's true, we go about it completely differently," Jackson argued but mostly at Lindsay's back.<br><br>Lindsay turned, convinced of her view. "I don't think so. We both work to the same ends..." She strode away then stopped suddenly. "What the fuck is this?"<br><br>Jackson came up close to see what it was. A poster advertised Mailgirls In The Office. It was not fresh, and had not been completely plastered over. And although it was somewhat weather battered, the gist was clear from the bold type words. Although it was hard to work out what the photo or perhaps illustration had been. Lindsay glared at Jackson. "I thought you lot were shy of any publicity." She read the poster out loud. "One night only. And we've missed it. Damn, it would have been fun. Do you know anything about it?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "First I've heard of it." She examined the poster for clues. "Looks like a student production. So I guess it's not a surprise they staged it for only one night only."<br><br>"I'm curious. We should find out what we can about whoever did this."<br><br>"Why?" asked Jackson, despite actually thinking of doing the same thing. But she wanted to draw out Lindsay's line of thinking. "Do we own the copyright for the term 'mailgirls'? Although it would be interesting to find out how they dramatised the concept." And whether they cast a conniving boss, she considered privately.<br><br>Lindsay was definite. "You can't copyright 'mailgirls'. Believe me, I tried."<br><br>Jackson wondered how she could investigate further. Lindsay meanwhile had moved on, looking for her next cup of coffee, asking Jackson which place they should go to. Jackson explained that she had no idea which of the outlets was best and suggested that Lindsay select one that she liked the look of, the décor and perhaps the staff.<br><br>Jackson wondered that Lindsay's mind was racing with all the managerial things that she was juggling and that she had already forgotten about the Uni play. But over coffee, Lindsay brought it up again. "So there is some interest about you mailgirls in Melbourne," she started. "You see. It's inevitable. People want to know. And see you. You'll have to get used to it." Lindsay waited but Jackson did not bite at that, rather she sipped at her coffee, forcing Lindsay to continue her thoughts out loud. "Do you think things in the office would be any different for you if it all was more publicised? You do realised that in the States, our mailgirls are recognised in the street?"<br><br>Jackson realised that she did need to answer back. "I don't think there would be much change to how we operate in the office, given that the modern office is essentially a closed space. I mean what can you do? Organise guided tours through the building while people — including us — are attempting to work?"<br><br>Lindsay smiled. "Well, I may consider that."<br><br>Jackson was expected to laugh. She didn't. Rather, she continued in the same vein. "What would change would be our lives outside of work and our privacy after hours."<br><br>"But you would be known, famous. And you would be the face of the company," Lindsay urged like that could only be a good thing.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "I'm not sure any of us would want that if the effect is to become public mailgirls twenty-four hours a day." Did Lindsay know she had been talking to Heather in the States?<br><br>They stopped the topic at that point. Jackson because she felt she had outlined her concerns as clearly as possible. And Lindsay because she was convinced that despite any concerns, it was inevitable that Harada Industries' mailgirls in Melbourne would sooner or later become far more visible than they were now. She believed what she had said. People wanted to know. And see. They both finished their beverages. And Jackson knew that meant shopping. For Lindsay.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch and Jackson were chatting as friends, him behind his desk and Jackson over at his meeting table. She was partially distracted by a document that she had open on her laptop which she was constantly amending.<br><br>"You know," worried Mitch, "we, um, you haven't done the thing recently with me?"<br><br>Jackson looked up to give Mitch some more attention. "The thing?" she teased.<br><br>Mitch smiled at their renewed intimacy. "You know what I mean," he tried.<br><br>"I do? What is this thing?" she affected, crossing her knees.<br><br>Mitch took a deep breath. "Wanking off," he answered like he was uncertain about using those words.<br><br>"Ah," Jackson responded, "that." She smiled wryly. "Sorry, in these uncertain times I seem to have lost my sex drive." Although she hid that Mitch had surprised her. This was the usually uptight Mitch using that language! Maybe his demotion had loosened him up. But Jackson truly did not feel like a wank, as she had said. Although she was curious about Mitch's state of mind, in his new role.<br><br>But before any more, Fanny bustled into the room noting the dry atmosphere between the two of them. "What's up?" she asked as she planted herself next to Jackson. She looked to Jackson then Mitch.<br><br>"Jackson's lost her sex drive," Mitch reported.<br><br>Fanny looked at the other mailgirl, probing. "You have?"<br><br>Jackson rested her hands on the table. "It comes and goes," she sighed. "Why are we having this conversation?" Hoping that Fanny would not remind her of their mutual masturbation.<br><br>But Fanny looked over to Mitch and backed off. "Probably best if I stay out of it," she smiled, "you two sort it out."<br><br>Before Mitch could answer that, not that he particularly wanted to, Jan and Annette sauntered in and plonked on the couch. Jackson turned and greeted them, appearing happy that she could bury her personal issues for the moment.<br><br>Mitch looked to Jackson, finding his managerial bearing. She looked around and looked back at him. "Waiting for Lauryn," she advised. She then noted a prompt on her laptop. "She's busy," Jackson advised them, "got a message to deliver." The rest of the mailgirls laughed. "Come on, you lot." Jackson checked the message again. "She said to start without her."<br><br>"You're a lucky man, Mitch, four naked girls in the room with you," Annette cooed. "And another one on her way."<br><br>"I wonder how you do it?" Mitch wondered. "According to my app you're all busy with messages."<br><br>Jan looked over to Jackson. "Shall I tell him?"<br><br>Jackson gave Jan a scold. "You may as well now," she conceded.<br><br>Jan looked over to Mitch with a smile. "I hacked the app," she told him.<br><br>"When?" he reacted.<br><br>Jan shrugged. "Early on. It wasn't complicated. The mob downstairs turned off the security to do some customisations. And, well, they didn't turn it back on." She looked around. "It's just us who know. And you now."<br><br>Mitch looked curious. "So what do you do?"<br><br>Jan smiled. "Oh, not much unless we have to. You don't want to attract attention. But for a meeting like this, well Jackson is doing some work for you, Fanny is offline for some research, and we're busy on some other deliveries."<br><br>Mitch wondered. "And if someone like Lindsay or Stuart walks in?"<br><br>Jan looked unconcerned. "Well, Jackson is on your ticket, Fanny needed to ask you something about procedure for her research and Annette and I are waiting in line for you to respond to our messages. It's not our fault that we all got called to your office at the same time. Blame the app."<br><br>Jackson coughed for attention. "So we can proceed?" She got a general acknowledgement. "Now, we have two issues in front of us. The current affairs visit and the eleventh floor expansion. I'll tell you what I've been thinking about the TV thing first, so let's deal with that. Mitch, we absolutely need your input, so interrupt at any time, okay?" She smiled at him, hoping that he hadn't taken any offence at any of the revelations that had occurred in the previous ten or so minutes.<br><br>Jackson went through her collected mailgirls' demands for the visit: No faces. Obviously they will blur out our naughty bits. No shots of anyone using the apps, so they don't accidentally get our names. And the mezzanine is off limits to them. "That seems to be the main things that we've all agreed on. Anything I've missed out?" She looked around the group and then to Mitch. There was general agreement with the points and Mitch nodded agreement too. "We won't get final cut. And we can't stop them being sleazy and childish about us, no matter what we want. And no shots of anyone entering the building so that they can accidentally identify us coming in to work."<br><br>Annette spoke up. "What if they want to interview any of us?"<br><br>Jackson thought about that for a moment. "Well, I won't interview with them. If you choose to, that's up to you. But remember, if you do interview, they are going to have unpixelated footage of you, whether or not they choose to use anything. And they'll have your voice too."<br><br>"Yeah that makes sense," Annette agreed.<br><br>"What about the others?" Mitch asked.<br><br>At that moment Lauryn came in. She smiled but she looked a little stressed. She also glanced over at Jan who did a little work on her app and then smiled at Lauryn.<br><br>But Fanny noticed. "What happened to you?" she demanded.<br><br>Lauryn tried to laugh about it. "That Stuart. He's going to be a handful. Tried to dress me down for not kneeling while I waited for his reply to Lindsay's message. Doesn't like mailgirls talking back, that one."<br><br>"I thought he was working out of Lindsay's office?" Mitch asked.<br><br>"Well he found a spare desk for a while up with the Business Analysts." She had a strange look on her face.<br><br>"You don't mean?" Annette asked, twigging.<br><br>"Your old desk?" Jan realised. Lauryn nodded. Jan got up and gave her a hug.<br><br>Jackson coughed. "Sorry girls, we're just about to get onto that as a general problem. Sorry, Lauryn, not much time."<br><br>"Sure," Lauryn accepted as she looked for somewhere to sit. It was a choice between at the table with Jackson and Fanny or the couch between the other two. She chose the couch. Jan patted her thigh reassuringly.<br><br>Jackson continued, reading from her laptop. "I'm not sure there is anything we can do about the expansion of our range up to the eleventh except to make sure that the target times are still reasonable. That's covered in the EA, so that should not be a problem. Now, as Lauryn has just shown, what is a problem will be how they treat us..."<br><br>"They're engineers," interjected Lauryn.<br><br>"Indeed," Jackson agreed, "but that doesn't automatically mean bad behaviour or things that cannot be changed. But what it does mean unfortunately is that they are going to experience, let's say, a less than optimum example from the manager on their floor."<br><br>"They've all seen the videos," Jan reminded them.<br><br>"And Stuart has set ideas from what he was doing back in the States," Annette added.<br><br>"Yeah, I know," Jackson agreed. "We are including in the presentation — the training session — what is different between Australia and the States and why."<br><br>Lauryn looked doubtful. "You think that will work?"<br><br>Jackson looked at her softly. "Sorry, but that's how we change behaviour. It's necessary step one. Bad behaviour has to be modified gradually. That's how it works." Lauryn nodded her grudging acceptance of that.<br><br>"We need to hold firm with Stuart," Jan suggested. "Hopefully we can wear him down. We don't change." There was general acceptance that was the best that they could do. The other mailgirls looked to Jackson.<br><br>"Some really good ideas there," Jackson concluded. She looked around. "Are we done for today?" Meaning that she had decided that they were.<br><br>"There's one more thing," Jan spoke up. The others looked at her, apparently surprised. "Mitch, we want to watch you wank Jackson off. If that is all right with both of you?" She smiled like she really wanted to see it.<br><br>"I guess..." Mitch started, looking around the room.<br><br>Jackson sighed. "Really?" she asked. Had Jan heard her before?<br><br>Fanny looked across the table at her, showing some concern. "Girl, you need it. You know you do." Jackson looked hopefully at her closest friend, helpless to respond to that. Sensing that the others wanted to her to do it.<br><br>"And we want to see Mitch's special technique," Annette giggled.<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "It's not that special," he attempted.<br><br>Annette would not have any of that. "But we hear that it works!" she exclaimed. "Even on Jackson!"<br><br>"All right," Jackson concluded, feeling trapped. And something else... She stood up and put her hands on her hips.<br><br>"Yes!" Jan exclaimed.<br><br>Feigning that she had no alternative, Jackson went over to Mitch's desk, posing on the corner facing him and then with a warm smile for him, she arranged herself so that he had full access to her, lying back on her elbows with her legs spread, one foot up on the desk, the other resting on Mitch's leg.<br><br>"Take your time," Jackson asked softly, "get me ready first." Mitch tried to look serious about his designated task. He rubbed his hands together to warm them, then ran his fingers up and down her thighs, getting closer to her pussy then away, then back until he was running a hand around her inner lips. Then relaxing with a grin he scraped a fingernail across her clit. Jackson groaned as she tried to hold her poise. That wasn't going to happen as Mitch increased his effort. Jackson threw her head back. She couldn't control herself now. She came long and loudly. To her cringe, her colleagues applauded her as she returned to reality.<br><br>Coming down from her high, Jackson noted that Lauryn had not joined in the hilarity and rather appeared quiet and private. Fanny later confirmed that Lauryn had stayed that way throughout the performance. Jackson did note with concern as she got off Mitch's desk that Lauryn couldn't leave the room soon enough, leaving ahead of the rest.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "Australian mailgirls are turned upside down.", 
                    content: `Marjorie Jackson was going up the stairs and found Lauryn Mark going down. "Hey," she called ahead to the other mailgirl, stopping Lauryn who was now on the landing facing her. "I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay," Jackson began, causing Lauryn to stop.<br><br>"Sure," Lauryn answered after a moment, avoiding eye contact.<br><br>Jackson looked unconvinced as she regarded the other naked woman now they were close. "Yesterday in the meeting in Mitch's office. You didn't seem yourself."<br><br>"Nah, everything's okay," Lauryn responded which did not change Jackson's concern about her.<br><br>"The visit?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"Well, I'll be happier when the camera crew have been and gone."<br><br>"But you know we can keep out of their way while they are here.<br><br>Lauryn looked troubled. "You know they are going to want mailgirl footage, that's what they will be here for. Keeping out of the way is not going to be that simple."<br><br>"Hopefully it will happen and blow over." Jackson sighed loudly. "Lauryn, you're the closest friend I have here. You're the only one I want to do this with." She reached for Lauryn's upper thigh, gently stroked it, and to her relief Lauryn did not back away. In fact she looked to Jackson a little pleadingly but she did not appear to mind when Jackson reached between her legs, ran a finger gently between her lips.<br><br>Lauryn gave Jackson a half-smile. "That's nice," she conceded. "But I have Fanny waiting for me. She wants to interrogate me further about my holiday. So later?"<br><br>Jackson nodded and let the other mailgirl continue on her way. She watched Lauryn descend out of her sight admiring the sight of her from the back. Like Jackson she had slender hips and a tight bottom which only slightly swelled to the sides. Nothing there to grip onto, Jackson smiled, as she considered that Lauryn was indeed the mailgirl she was closest to. Sure she had also known Fanny from before, but Fanny was usually in researcher mode; you always felt that she was collecting everything that you said or did near her as data for her research. Jackson could never quite relax around her. Was that unfair on Fanny? She would have to ask Lauryn about her interview. The short encounter with Lauryn had left Jackson with an empty feeling, unsettled. She needed to resolve things there. She licked her fingers that still tasted of Lauryn and then found her clit.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"Ah, here you are." Lindsay Davenport had walked around an unpainted partition on the 11th floor to find her new manager Stuart Broad busy at his desk. "The place is pretty much a building site," she noted, looking around. Stuart grunted his acknowledgement of that in a way that suggested he was busy and she may be the boss, but she was wasting his time with the small talk. She looked over to confirm that the tradies setting up the rest of the office were out of hearing range. She got to the point. Her demeanour made that clear. "Stuart, I think you need to tone it down if we are going to get anywhere with these people." She hoped for some solidarity between the two of them, Americans, sent over to sort out the Australian office.<br><br>Stuart looked up to his boss with a scowl at being interrupted. "Are you getting soft, Davenport?" he sneered. "You and I know what these people need."<br><br>Was that true, Lindsay wondered to herself. Was she really like him? But she kept that private. "You don't much like the mailgirls," she pointed out. "And they're not happy with you."<br><br>That took Stuart by surprise. "Why should I?" he recoiled.<br><br>Lindsay smiled. "Consider the situation. You are here and your family has yet to come over and join you. And we have a number of naked young women to stare at," she suggested.<br><br>"I choose not to look," Stuart muttered.<br><br>"Oh really?" Lindsay smiled, "Not even for a moment?" She typed casually at her phone as she studied the man sitting in front of her.<br><br>"I won't let anything threaten my marriage," Stuart firmly asserted.<br><br>"So not even a hint of a thought," Lindsay prodded.<br><br>"You wouldn't understand," Stuart retorted.<br><br>"Because I'm a woman?"<br><br>"Because you're not married."<br><br>At that moment Annette Kellerman, athletic and of course naked, came around the partition. "Oh there you are," she declared and strode over to Stuart's desk. She put one hand on the desk, so somehow she was between Lindsay and Stuart. "You have a message?" she asked Lindsay. Stuart made to look back down at his work.<br><br>"Stuart asked me to call a mailgirl," Lindsay told her with a glint.<br><br>"Problem with the app?" Annette mused. She leant over Stuart to have a look. "Show me," she suggested as the man tried to squirm back as her pert breasts dangled close to his face when she leant further forward to try to help. Totally unselfconsciously. Her face close to his. Annette picked up Stuart's mobile, brought up the app and typed and scrolled for a few moments. "You've used up all your guest requests," she told him. "You need to do the course," she added plainly as she stood there invitingly. She adjusted her stance, legs astride as if she needed to better balance herself.<br><br>"The fucking mailgirl course," Stuart seethed.<br><br>"No, the respecting mailgirl course," Annette corrected him softly as if he had made an accidental error.<br><br>Lindsay smirked as the self-described family man looked up in anger to find that he was staring at a naked young woman whose breasts and pussy were clearly visible, the mailgirl acting completely unconcerned at any effect that she may have had on her viewer. She had him. He was too distracted to speak. Until he looked away from Annette at Lindsay and then away from Lindsay and into blank space. He silently counted to three. "You should be on your knees waiting for my message," he ordered, trying to assert himself.<br><br>Annette did not flinch and did not move. "I think you really need to do the course," she replied softly.<br><br>Lindsay bit her lip.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lauryn meantime settled down with Fanny on the benches on the mezzanine. In accord with the new requiremnts, Wendy Turnbull, their supervisor, looked up from her laptop every so often to check on the two mailgirls who had set themselves up at the other end of the room to her, giving them some semblance of privacy. Well, some semblance, for the moment.<br><br>Annette Kellerman strode into the room, back from her delivery for Stuart. "Still getting used to not wearing clothes again?" she fired off at Lauryn with a smile. Lauryn rolled her eyes, what an original comment. Annette went up to Wendy, ran a finger through her supervisor's hair. "Are you going to get dolled up for the cameras?" she asked Wendy who tried to make light of the taunt. Annette let her go and continued onto the shower. "Freshening up for the next call," she announced as she disappeared from their area. If she was in any way flustered about her Stuart altercation she did not show it.<br><br>Which allowed Fanny to concentrate back on Lauryn. Her interviewee sat with her, arms crossed over her breasts, legs together. Fanny poised towards her quarry, laptop on her knees to take notes. Naturally, her large breasts swayed as she looked from Lauryn to the screen and back. Fanny seemed completely unconscious of that.<br><br>Lauryn smiled. "See what I have to put up with since I got back from holidays?" she mock complained.<br><br>"Must be terrible," Fanny mock consoled.<br><br>"That's not the worst," Lauryn continued, "I don't know if tan lines are a good or bad things here." She looked to Fanny for help. They both laughed. "I don't know," Lauryn continued, "I don't like being too much the centre of attention."<br><br>"Interesting," Fanny observed. "Of course I am trying to get inside your head," Fanny warned her. "You know about my research. So what I want to find out is how you were reacting to being able to wear clothes all day while you were on holidays from here. Do you wear clothes at home?"<br><br>"Of course I do!" Lauryn seemed shocked.<br><br>Fanny tried to placate her. "You'd be surprised. Some of our mailgirls take their clothes off as soon as they get home. They say it feels more normal for them after their day here."<br><br>"Do you?"<br><br>"Let's just say that I wear less clothes at home than I used to." Fanny shrugged. "I didn't realise that was what I was doing until I thought about it after interviewing the others recently. I realised also that I've been wearing the least amount of clothing between here and home."<br><br>Lauryn looked around, confirmed that no one else was within listening distance. "I'm glad to get out of here each night," she confided.<br><br>"You don't like the job?"<br><br>Lauryn shook her head. "I don't hate it. But to me it is, when all is said and done, just a job. In the before times, when I was a business analyst, I didn't take my work home, to use that cliché. I did my job in the office and at the end of each day, I went home, relaxed, had dinner, was a girlfriend, went out or stayed in and didn't give work much thought until I was back in here the next day. I thought I could do the same as a mailgirl. I thought the nudity would be no big deal, but it is a lot different. Maybe I should have seen that."<br><br>"Like your status, how you are treated in the office?"<br><br>Lauryn stretched herself out, then self-consciously wrapped her arms tight, covering her bust. "If you haven't heard my stories, it seems that my status has gone up here since I took my clothes off. I never realised that was what would happen."<br><br>"Sorry, I don't think I know about that. Do you want to explain?" Fanny was curious.<br><br>"My business analyst work — when I get the chance to do it — seems to be taken more seriously now that I do it with my tits showing."<br><br>"Interesting, I did not know."<br><br>"Maybe it's the business analyst in me, but I take a long view of this phase of my career." Lauryn gave a little laugh. "I can't imagine that I would be naked in an office for too long, say in ten years or so, so I have to think about my career, the real one. I mean it's fine for you. You are clearly aiming for academia or something, I don't know, in the media or somewhere as an authority on mailgirls, so this is going to directly help you get there. But take Annette. What is she going to be doing in ten years' time?"<br><br>Of course this was precisely the time that Annette came out of the shower area still drying her hair, letting it bounce off her shoulders as she swished it around to give it some shape. "Are you talking about me?" she asked well knowing that Lauryn had just mentioned her.<br><br>Fanny looked over and smiled at Annette. "Where are you going to be in ten years' time?" she echoed Lauryn.<br><br>Annette shrugged. "Oh that. No idea, I could be anywhere." She looked at Lauryn who did not seem comfortable. "Well, I could still be doing this. Or maybe not. I don't know."<br><br>"Do you wear clothes at home?" Lauryn asked her.<br><br>"Hell no," she replied adamantly, "this is freedom." As well as splaying her arms to emphasise her exclamation, she also spread her legs a little wide, underlining how free she felt. At that moment they all stopped at the sound of a familiar beeping and checked their apps. "Me again," Annette sang out. "Aren't I the popular girl today!"<br><br>And with that she was off, leaving Lauryn and Fanny alone again under the occasionally watchful eye of Wendy who was mostly concentrating on her own laptop. Lauryn again looked pained which Fanny picked up on immediately. "What is it?" she asked gently.<br><br>Lauryn looked down at the floor and took a moment to answer. "You're going to think I'm stupid," she started. Fanny looked at her encouragingly, so she took a deep breath and continued. "When I took this on, I thought the novelty would soon wear off. That everyone would get used to us and this would be no big deal." She gestured at her body, her obvious state of undress and display.<br><br>Fanny nodded empathetically. "I think that was a bit optimistic," she suggested. "But hopefully I'm being delicate here because I would like to draw this out, what, did you imagine that eventually you could just wander around the office invisibly all day?"<br><br>Lauryn again took a moment to organise her thoughts. But this time she looked Fanny in the eyes. "You know when you see or do something a number of times and it becomes routine? I'm trying to think of an example. Like touch typing. I can type out some words that I use a lot in my analysis like, I don't know, 'profit margin' for example, without even thinking about them. And I thought that after everyone using the mailgirl service had seen my breasts and my butt a few dozen times the novelty would wear off. But no." She looked plaintively at Fanny.<br><br>Fanny looked kindly at her. "But you're a naked girl — and an attractive one — in a clothed office. And that is always going to be a novelty."<br><br>"Do you have evidence for that?"<br><br>Fanny retracted. "Good point. I was generalising rather than testing. Let me backtrack. I too would have imagined that the novelty would wear off, a bit anyway. Although men being men..." She thought for a moment before recasting her opinion. "But we don't have evidence. And partly that is because things in Japan and the US are always changing."<br><br>Lauryn nodded. "Things change here too, the new management, the engineers coming to the eleventh floor and now the TV people coming," she agreed.<br><br>Fanny agreed. "There's always going to be change. But on the other hand, if this is not for you, you can always quit."<br><br>Lauryn shook her head. "I'm a sticker. And I still do my BA work every so often too. You may think I'm being strange but I'm not completely averse to being a mailgirl. I am pretty proud of this..." She leant back on her hands, her breasts pointing at Fanny, her flat stomach heaving a little. She even spread her legs, swivelled one knee to completely expose herself. Then she sat back up. "But you know sometimes it gets me down, and this is one of those times."<br><br>Fanny reached over to gently grip the other woman's arm. "I get what you're saying but it's different for me. As you said."<br><br>Lauryn let the other mailgirl run her hand further up her arm, just grazing her breast. "As you say, you are visiting, you're a tourist here taking the experience for your own ends."<br><br>Fanny leaned closer. "And I hope by exploring as much of it as I can I am demystifying the experience. Ultimately making it better for everyone," she continued gently playing with Lauryn's nipples, first the one she had grazed, then reached over for the other.<br><br>Lauryn seemed to relax under Fanny's carress, but still she continued. "I'm worried about the way things seem to be changing here."<br><br>Fanny retracted her hand, trying to show that she was concerned about more than making Lauryn's nipples hard. "Are you coping?" she asked, genuinely concerned.<br><br>Lauryn deflected that. She spread her legs again. "I grew back my bush."<br><br>Fanny ran her fingers through the hair above Lauryn's slit as she lay right back, apparently allowing the researcher to do whatever she chose. Fanny let her fingers caress a little lower. "We've got the rules they have to abide by," she reminded Lauryn as she fingered her slit. "And we've always got Jackson."<br><br>Lauryn groaned. "I guess you're right," she heaved. She humped her hips and let out a gasp "Could you keep doing that for a little longer?" she urged.<br><br>Wendy looked over and smiled. Because she had already looked out of the room and knew that the mailgirls had a small audience watching them.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson sat opposite Lindsay Davenport as usual trying to get her full attention while the manager worked at her computer. Eventually Jackson gave up waiting. "Lindsay, they are going to be here in half an hour."<br><br>Lindsay glared over her desk at the mailgirl. "It would be nice if you gave me more notice than this," she snarled.<br><br>Jackson took a deep breath and remembered her time as a union negotiator. She gave Lindsay her nicest smile. "I know you're busy, but I sent you these conditions in an email on Friday."<br><br>"So it's an ultimatum," Lindsay snapped.<br><br>"No, I wouldn't put it like that. It's simply the rules we are going to follow if you want us on the telecast. We have a contract, you know."<br><br>Lindsay took a deep, loud breath. "Well, okay. It seems that I have no control over what you do." She tried to lighten up her mood. "But please, can two mailgirls be present when I do my interview? That's all I'm going to ask." She gave Jackson a hopeful look that almost worked, given the way things had started between them.<br><br>"Sure," Jackson smiled, "I'll see who wants to do it." And she stood up to leave. And looked around the office. "Where's Stuart?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay shot Jackson a conspiratorial look. "I gave him the day off," she answered.<br><br>"Wise," Jackson agreed and shook her head. Management getting time off for having the wrong worldview.<br><br>"I could have chained him to his new desk on the eleventh floor, but that's probably not a good look." Lindsay smiled hoping for a connection moment with Jackson who missed it. "Oh come on," Lindsay snorted. "You're all giving as good as you get there."<br><br>Jackson relented and smiled. "So long as no one gets hurt," she laughed grudgingly, for Lindsay's benefit as she left the office.<br><br>Still shaking her head, she made her way past Betty Cuthbert's desk outside, giving the PA a friendly smile and then continued down to the mezzanine to tell the others the news and ask for volunteers.<br><br>Just before the agreed time, Shane was down on the ground floor waiting. He wondered for a moment whether there would be a time when there would be a mailgirl down in the foyer looking out onto Swanston Street waiting for visitors to arrive. After all, that should be a job for the lower grades. But this was an important greeting to get right. Mr Harada would expect a report, Lindsay Davenport had personally requested it, and perhaps millions would be watching it on TV.<br><br>Finished with his musements, Shane noticed a woman slightly shorter than him standing purposefully outside the building talking to a camera held by one crewman while a mike boom was being held near her by another woman. The woman was doing her intro outside the building, no doubt warning that she was about to enter a lion's den, Melbourne's secretive, most controversial business, or some other lurid promise. Mind, the reporter looked wholesome, soft facial features framed by blonde hair loosely flowing to just below the collar of a prim, sensible deep green blouse. Her pencil skirt finished above her knees adding to the impressive of an attractive, confident woman. Shane decided he liked her already. She finished her piece and turned to glance inside, no doubt looking for Shane. He crossed his arms and waited.<br><br>While he wondered. How would she react to the mailgirls? What would she say, what was her angle? Would this change things in the office? He was about to find out. Finished with her intro work, and with the crew poised to record her descent into this den, she strode into the foyer and straight up to Shane. The camera operator, an older man dressed neatly but not ostentatiously who was affecting to have seen it all and the boom carrier, a quite young woman in loose coveralls, did their job keeping pace with the reporter, both trying to match her air of detachment.<br><br>The reporter held out a hand. "Rosemary Millwall," she announced. "You're Shane Crawford," she added as she gripped his hand. She gestured at her two companions. "Daryl Braithwaite, Debra," she advised Shane, somewhat offhand about the boom carrier who seemed to accept that.<br><br>Shane smiled at all of them. "Let's take you up and get you started," he responded as he led them to the lifts. As they ascended to the sixth floor, Shane began to explain the ground rules that the mailgirls had set.<br><br>"I hope that won't upset things too much," he asked.<br><br>"I thought the mailgirls submitted to management and all the other workers," Rosemary asked raising her eyebrows.<br><br>"This is Australia," Shane smiled with his natural warmth. You haven't read the EA, he thought. This could be interesting.<br><br>"What does that mean?" Rosemary shot back, evidently parrying to hide the gap in her knowledge.<br><br>"You've seen the videos?" Shane replied evenly. Because everyone had seen the videos.<br><br>"Yes," snapped the reporter. Shane noticed the glance that Daryl the cameraman gave her. Because he was evidently thinking what Shane was too, that Rosemary Millwall, the reporter, was not too far from the look of the American mailgirls as seen in the videos that Shane had mentioned. Put that thought out of your mind, Shane decided as he led them through to Betty Cuthbert's desk.<br><br>Up on the sixth floor, both Daryl and Debra had glanced out the window that looked down on the mezzanine and had seen something down there. Shane looked quickly and saw that Jackson was standing with the tall athletic Jan Stephenson, having a conversation with Wendy. Two mailgirls with their clothed supervisor. Shane checked that Daryl was not filming.<br><br>While the four of them stood at Betty's desk waiting for her to give them attention, Kimiko Date, her straight black hair flapping against her bare back, dashed past and into Lindsay's office. After a few moments, she dashed out past them and away, too quickly for any meaningful reaction from the visitors. Once she was gone, the three from the TV station looked to Shane who affected not to notice that anything unusual had happened. I'm playing this well, he thought.<br><br>Betty Cuthbert looked up at the group as if she had only just realised that they had arrived. "Ms Davenport is free to see you now," she advised in the flattest tone possible.<br><br>Jan and Jackson were confirming details with Wendy down on the mezzanine. "Lindsay has decided to have her interview in the boardroom," Wendy was telling them.<br><br>"Are you and Annette okay with that?" Jackson asked. She looked over to Annette who was sitting a little away from them attending to her appearance. She looked over when she heard her name.<br><br>"Why?" she asked<br><br>Ah, she's good, Jackson realised. "Lindsay wants it down there so that they have to keep the shots tight. There's no way they can have Mr Harada's pictures in sight on network television." They all smiled at the thought of that.<br><br>Kimiko knocked and entered Mitch's office. He looked up and smiled at the approaching mailgirl who also smiled warmly at him. "How are you today, Mitch?" she asked, rubbing a thigh against his desk as she faced him.<br><br>"Always better for seeing you," he rejoined, wondering if he was being too effusive. Well, he found Kimiko interesting, to say the least. "You must be thrilled today with the TV crew coming in. Are they here yet?"<br><br>Kimiko sighed theatrically then resumed her inviting smile. "That's why I'm here. I have a message for you from Lindsay about that. She wants both of us out of the way while they are around. We must be troublemakers or something." They both laughed. "Oh, and they have arrived, they're with Lindsay at the moment. Or soon will be. Betty was messing them around regarding their access when I was down there."<br><br>Mitch thought for a moment. "Well, I can disappear out of the building for a while. I guess they'll be here for an hour or two." Kimiko nodded, that seemed likely to her. Mitch continued. "How about I head out and you can log in on my PC so you can hide away here? How does that sound?" Kimiko nodded since that would likely make everyone happy. And she was not in the mood for any antics, she realised. Tormenting the staff was one thing, but this would go outside. Better to let this one pass.<br><br>Lindsay was reciting the history of Harada Industries to Rosemary who for a while was happy to nod along as the company grew from its humble Japanese beginnings then expanded first to Malaysia then to Australia and finally to the US. The camera operator stood against a wall conspicuously not filming. Debra stared into space waiting to be required.<br><br>Rosemary took advantage of Lindsay's need for a pause to breathe while explaining Harada's products and services. She butted in. "Can we do the mailgirls?" she asked with a hint of urgency which roused her crew to get ready for action.<br><br>"Oh yes," Lindsay agreed. "I'll just call the mailgirls to get ready. I thought I'd have a couple present while we do the interview." Rosemary nodded at that, sensing an opportunity. She knew that the mailgirls were off bounds for interviews. But she was a hard-nosed reporter. She was ready to fire a question or two at these women who were apparently happy to spend their workdays naked and at the beck and call of their clothed colleagues. She could not imagine what that would be like and how women would accept such degradation in the twenty-first century. But today she hoped to find out. There was a flurry outside the office and a knock at the door. Rosemary straightened up ready to admit the two naked women to her presence.<br><br>But it was the PA Betty waiting outside. She entered after Lindsay had called out "yes."<br><br>"The boardroom is ready for you," Betty Cuthbert announced from the doorway.<br><br>Lindsay looked to the reporter. "It's just around the corner," she advised as she got up from her desk. "I thought it would be a better place to do our interview." Rosemary nodded her agreement. Whatever it took to get her talking about mailgirls. And to get at least some of them in shot.<br><br>Lindsay looked back at her screen and frowned. "Sorry, I just have to do this one thing. Then we can go." She typed into her app and sat back to wait.<br><br>A moment later, Lauryn strode imperiously into Lindsay's office. No knocking. Lauryn marched up towards Lindsay as if uninterested in the effect of her presence, the exposure of her long legs and tight body. She rested a hand on the desk, leant down and looked Lindsay in the eye. "What do you want?" she asked the manager without a hint of deference.<br><br>Lindsay scratched out a note, folded it and gave to Lauryn who was still affecting not to acknowledge the TV crew. "Deliver this to Belinda, please," Lindsay asked her.<br><br>Lauryn took the note and stood up straight, appearing alert and ready to go. Then she scratched behind an ear. "Yeah," she drawled, "I'll get onto it." And she left.<br><br>Lindsay turned managerially towards the current affairs crew. "Follow me now," she told them as she left her office for the short walk to the boardroom. Once inside she acted as if there was nothing odd about the situation. The walls of course were lined with the bondage prints that had been provided by Mr Harada. The nude mailgirls Jan and Annette sat, breasts visible, at the far end of the board table, watching the group that had come in, waiting to see what would be required of them.<br><br>Lindsay fussed about with the crew, with them all trying to work out the best arrangement — where they should sit, what angles and finally what should be done with the mailgirls. They eventually agreed on Lindsay and Rosemary sitting in the open, facing each other while the mailgirls knelt on either side of Lindsay, their backs to the camera. Just in shot would be the lower parts of two of the bondage prints, hinting at what the whole pictures might be. Lindsay informed the mailgirls who had remained sitting at the table, wryly watching the discussion.<br><br>Annette looked to Jan who nodded back. "Yeah, that suits us," Annette drawled.<br><br>"I'm glad you agree," Lindsay snarked.<br><br>The mailgirls stayed in their places watching the others to try to see what they thought about the situation. The TV folk were going about their preparation work, presumably bought into the concept that mailgirls had no say and no rights in work situations like that. Jan looked to Annette. "Do we take the plunge and do an interview to tell them?"<br><br>Annette thought about that for a moment. She shook her head. "I don't know if they would get it. And if it doesn't fit their narrative, they probably won't use it." Jan looked at her. Annette gave her a playful slap. "I watch these things and know how they work. It's titillation, not education."<br><br>"Okay sorry," Jan retreated. "It's just I see you everyday as a nude bimbo who flaunts their assets around the office so you can get off on it with the dildos and stuff. I didn't realise you had brains too." They both laughed, their tension broken.<br><br>The others looked over from their discussion to see what the laughter was about, but clearly none of them had overheard anything of the discussion.<br><br>"See what I have to put up with," Annette pouted at Jan while playfully lifting her small breasts to point her nipples at Jan who chortled at the provocation. "Anything I say is ignored by everyone." The TV crew looked over and saw a pair of naked airheads fiddling with their breasts and playing teasing games with each other.<br><br>Eventually they were ready to start Lindsay's interview. The mailgirls had been positioned next to each other on the far side of Lindsay from Rosemary, kneeling with their backs to the camera, not quite touching thighs or shoulders. This meant that they could actually look to each other and share reactions without being noticed by the others. Lindsay answered the opening question with a statement that established her aim. "We are a normal company trying to make money. It is just that we have chosen this particular incentive for our staff."<br><br>Rosemary butted in. "So it makes the workers work harder? It's not a distraction?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay was glad that she had listened to Fanny. "We believe it improves productivity, but we are funding research to measure that."<br><br>"What will you do with the research?" Rosemary asked.<br><br>"Use it to promote our process to other companies." She read the look on Rosemary's face and quickly countered the reporter's concern with her next line. "It won't suit all companies but I'm sure that some can benefit from a mailgirls program." The mailgirls both grinned at that. Rosemary was momentarily speechless. Lindsay stepped back in. "That's why I agreed to do this interview. So others can see the benefits of having mailgirls in the office." Both mailgirls knew instinctively that the camera had slid from Lindsay to a moment's focus on their bare backs.<br><br>That gave Rosemary a moment to reassemble her thoughts. "The mailgirls in the US are far more visible, the public can see them in the mornings. And the videos. Is the same thing going to happen here?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay shook her head as if to say 'if only.' Instead she looked Rosemary in the eyes. "The labour laws are quite different here to the States. And, from what I understand, community attitudes too. So we tend to take a different approach."<br><br>Jan pulled a face for Annette. So Lindsay was learning the way things really were, amazing.<br><br>All the mailgirls except for Fanny and Kimiko were in the mezzanine change room when Jan and Annette returned. Fanny had passed the two of them on her way up at Shane's call. She got smiles from both of them assuring her that they had no problems with their now completed duties as she eased past them.<br><br>"So how did it go?" Jackson asked with some relaxation seeing that Jan and Annette were laughing together as they rejoined the group in the open area of the change rooms.<br><br>Jan looked to Annette given her newfound admiration for the former's PA's considered view on the situation. "Lindsay is using the platform to promote mailgirls to the business world," Annette reported.<br><br>There was a moment's silence. Until Wendy piped up. "She can't do that, can she?" Wendy was looking of course to Jackson.<br><br>Jackson smiled over to Wendy. "No reason why she cannot try. But it hasn't been much of a success in the States."<br><br>Pam perked up at that. "Why?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson looked over to Lauryn. "You've got the figures," she told her friend.<br><br>Lauryn stood up to effect her Analyst presentation approach. "It's actually very expensive to introduce mailgirls into an organisation. You need an owner with Mr Harada's determination and his deep pockets."<br><br>"Really?" asked Pam, "how much?"<br><br>"We're costing the company over a million dollars a year," Lauryn replied offhand. "And then there's Japan and the States. Who knows how much they are costing, although I would estimate that each of theirs is more expensive than us. Mailgirls are essentially a vanity project for Mr Harada."<br><br>"And he doesn't have any shareholders to get upset at him of course," Jan added.<br><br>"Which is why he indulges Fanny," Jackson continued. "He's hoping he can use her data to show the business benefits to other companies..."<br><br>At which point Fanny came back in. "Who's indulging me?" she asked with a smile.<br><br>"You know who," Jackson replied. "So what's going on?"<br><br>Fanny looked to Jan and Annette then accepted that she had the floor. "The reporter is setting up for a one on one interview with Shane..."<br><br>"...the bloke's view," laughed Annette. "Who knows what he'll say..."<br><br>"Or if any of it will be useable," Jan smirked.<br><br>"Or if he can keep it in his pants," Annette shrieked, feigning horror at that thought.<br><br>"I'm sure he will be very professional," Lauryn added and they all laughed. Jackson was pleased to note that with her outburst Lauryn had lightened up too. She hoped it would last.<br><br>"How long do you think they will take with Shane?" Pam asked when they had all settled down.<br><br>"Until he runs out of meaningful things to say," Lauryn offered dryly. Because they knew what would then follow.<br><br>Jackson chose to spell it out. "And then the crew are allowed to do a walk around the floors," she added, "during which time we'll get calls to do our stuff."<br><br>"Look your best girls!" Annette rang out.<br><br>"It will be showtime," Lauryn grumbled.<br><br>The crew stayed close together. This was the agreement with Lindsay. It was also practical. If Rosemary Millwall got lucky with an interview, she wanted the camera and sound right there. She knew that she would only get one chance. As promised the mailgirls had been sent on various calls and they had some footage of them in longshot, never having been quite close enough to their paths.<br><br>Until Rosemary almost ran into Pam Burridge as they both approached a blind corner on the ninth floor as Pam took a message from Lindsay to Belinda Clarke. "Sorry," they both gasped as they recoiled. Pam smiled first.<br><br>Then Rosemary looked at her with some recognition. "You were on that cover, weren't you?" she asked.<br><br>"I was on a cover," the naked mailgirl conceded.<br><br>"Why?" Rosemary asked.<br><br>Pam shrugged. "It pays better." She looked at Rosemary as if to ask 'any more questions.' But she straightened up. "Sorry, I actually have a message to deliver." And she sped past the TV crew.<br><br>Rosemary turned to her cameraman. She was about to ask but realised that she did not need to. She knew that he had caught none of the encounter. And it was their first close encounter. She hoped that they would be ready for the next one.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch returned to his office and found the nude mailgirl concentrating on the screen, perched on his chair looking like she commanded the office. He smiled, being Mitch. "You look the part," Mitch told Kimiko. "I'm sorry to have to take the office back from you."<br><br>Kimiko smiled back. "If ever you need me to cover for you," she joked as she logged out of his computer and stood up so that she could vacate and Mitch could return to his place. She remained behind the desk near the chair, so Mitch needed squeeze up close to her as he retook his place. Kimiko smiled down at Mitch warmly as she again thanked him for the sanctuary.<br><br>Mitch too was in a good mood. "I might just take you up on that one day."<br><br>Mitch watched her depart, her square shoulders, firm bottom, what was he thinking? But he almost regretted that she left his office as soon as he sat back down. Mitch found that he liked having her around. Was he lonely? Or was it her unpredictability. Or what?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"It's been a while since we've done this," Cara smiled as she slowly walked around her sister, who knelt naked in the games room. Once around. And then again. Cara had dressed in a severe black jacket with square shoulders over a full length black dress. She dressed for effect, rhythmically slapping a riding crop against her palm as she circled Emily. Stopping her review facing Emily, she corrected the space between her sister's knees with the riding crop. "This is a nice one," Cara smiled as she gently swished it against Emily's flank. "Tell me, what did they say in the shop when you bought it?"<br><br>"I told her I like riding horses," Emily offered.<br><br>"Did they believe you?"<br><br>Emily smiled sheepishly.<br><br>"What did the woman say?" Cara demanded. She cracked the crop dangerously close to the same spot on Emily's flank.<br><br>Emily flinched. "I think she said 'remember you want to control the animal, not hurt it'. And then she demonstrated it for me, flicked the crop, made that cracking sound."<br><br>"This cracking sound?" Cara asked as she demonstrated with a flick of her wrist. Although this time she cracked the whip in the air, away from her sister.<br><br>"Thank you, master," Emily responded like it was expected of her.<br><br>"Accepted, Mailgirl 1." Cara sat back down on the sofa and sighed. "The show was a success," Cara added.<br><br>"No one published any reviews. Maybe we scared them off," Emily wondered. "But we made some money for theatre, so they are happy for me to put on another production," she reported. "Almost encouraged me."<br><br>Cara shook her head. "But Mailgirl 1, we can't put on another mailgirls production without having our guest on stage with us again."<br><br>Emily looked over to her sister. "I have been trying to track her down."<br><br>Cara looked interested. "What do we know?"<br><br>Emily rocked a tiny amount on her toes. "I found out her name is Pam Burridge. Actually I found out on the night when we googled that cover. Spoke to her agency. She has disappeared."<br><br>Cara looked concerned. "No, she hasn't. We had her on stage."<br><br>Emily smiled a little although she was starting to strain to hold her pose, her breasts thrust forward, trying to keep her head held high. "We could run a 'Desperately Seeking Pam' campaign. Search Party. Or something," she offered.<br><br>Cara nodded as she stood back up. She absently tapped her crop against her sister's bottom, knowing that would make her strain more as her haunches tightened. "That has possibilities," Cara mused. "If we find her, tell her that we want to do a revival."<br><br>Emily put one hand on the floor, unable to hold her pose any longer. "What do you think Mum or Dad would say if they came home and saw us like this?" She looked cautiously at her sister wondering what she would suffer for failing.<br><br>Cara though did not seem to mind the frailty. She was thinking. "We could always blame it on the example that the parents set us. After all, Dad was the one who introduced mailgirls here."<br><br>If only she knew how often their father Mitchell Johnson had knelt in that same spot in the games room as his wife, dressed not unlike Cara, had corrected him with her own riding crop. If only it came out what sort of family they really were.<br><br>Emily suspected that she could completely relax. She completely collapsed her pose and reclined back on her elbows. "What do you think about the demotion. Do you think it has changed dad?" she asked.<br><br>Cara wondered about that. "Good question, hard to tell. I guess one way to find out is to threaten to be a mailgirl again."<br><br>Emily smiled brightly. "Yeah, I haven't done that for a while."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson sat on the massage table swinging her legs demurely. She was dressed, in a loose top and comfortable linen trousers. Destinee her masseuse faced her although she reclined back on the bed opposite and was pretty much totally exposed to her client wearing only a diaphanous gown.<br><br>"In case you've forgotten how this works," Destinee smiled over at the woman who appeared to be relaxing despite the strange arrangement between them, "you are the client and I am the professional. So you are supposed to take your clothes off and then I give you pleasure."<br><br>Jackson smiled warmly back. "Maybe I would like to watch for a while," she suggested, "I'd like to see you..." It was pretty obvious.<br><br>"Well, you're paying," Destinee laughed. She opened her gown, then shook it down off her shoulders. "Do this?" the larger woman asked. She spread her legs and pressed both her hands into her thighs. Destinee was soon pressing her fingers into her pussy. Caught in the moment she closed her eyes, as she reached for the greatest pleasure. She stopped suddenly and looked over at the other woman. "Anyone else getting me doing this like this and just sitting there. I'd take it as an insult."<br><br>Jackson seesawed her legs as she ran one hand through her shortish hair, flicked it behind her ear. "Things have changed," she responded, a little upset. "Now I seem to spend the day being looked at, being told what to do. I like these few moments of control."<br><br>"Did I misunderstand? I thought you were getting pally with your new boss?" Destinee got up off the bed and stepped towards Jackson.<br><br>"Hardly. I'm either supporting her fragile self perception or tagging along with her outside the office as some kind of pet. I don't think she has had much experience of having real friends."<br><br>"So why do you do it?" Destinee placed her hands on Jackson's shoulders, gently pressing them with her fingers.<br><br>"Maybe you haven't been in the office politics situation? Where things can go bad for you if you're not available for your boss's whims. First they suggest that you go out together for a coffee. And before you know it, it is shopping trips, dinners and attempts at intimacy."<br><br>"Sounds terrible. And she hasn't touched you?" Destinee raised Jackson's top over her head, then went behind her so that she could massage Jackson's bare neck.<br><br>"Despite having been able to inspect every single aspect of my body and then have me at close range over dinners, in dress shops and such, she not only hasn't laid a finger on me but she hasn't even shown any sexual interest in me at all." Jackson pressed back against the expert fingers.<br><br>"What would you do if she did?" Destinee prodded her between the shoulder blades earning a groan from her client.<br><br>"I don't honestly know, Destinee. The whole thing between us has been so 'stand away' and sexless that I don't think that I can even anticipate anything happening between us. If she invited me back to her room after dinner, it would probably be to proofread her emails." They both laughed.<br><br>"Take the rest off," Destinee suggested.<br><br>Jackson pulled a face at the other woman. "It's always sex with you," she complained as she slid her pants down. They were both naked.<br><br>"That is generally the case in a place like this," Destinee responded. Jackson did not need a bra, she did not need one to support her firm proud breasts. And she had no underwear beneath her pants either. "I think we'll have you on your front, so I can bash the tension out of your back first." Jackson smiled as she lay herself down on her front. Maybe she did not mind being bossed around. But then at least Destinee who was already teasing the sides of her breasts with her expert fingers really did intend to give Jackson pleasure. And she knew how to.<br><br>Destinee worked Jackson's firm buttocks as she chatted. "How's your boss man?" she asked. She reached into the crevice getting first a groan of pleasure then a tightening, a pushback.<br><br>"You've never been there before," Jackson checked.<br><br>"I'm wearing gloves," Destinee assured her as she pressed a little deeper than before, close to her opening. "Now tell me about your man," she repeated as she pressed a little deeper.<br><br>Jackson wriggled a little as she got used to the new sensations that she admitted were not unpleasurable. She thought about how to respond to the question. "Polite, respectful. I don't know if he's being standoffish or if that's just his reaction to me being, I don't know, careful around him and that's the vibe that he is reflecting back." She knew that the answer was not straightforward. But neither were her thoughts on the matter of Mitch.<br><br>"You haven't tried anything with him?" Destinee was, as ever, direct.<br><br>Jackson relaxed as Destinee moved her practised hands down her inner thighs. "It's a bit hard to suddenly try to seduce him or whatever when I've spent months completely naked with him discussing employment regulations and contract details."<br><br>"That's a shame." Destinee laughed.<br><br>"Indeed. At least it would be if I was sure I wanted to seduce him." Jackson thought for a moment whether to share. "Oh, there was an incident."<br><br>Destinee raised her eyebrows. "Tell me."<br><br>Jackson recounted the council of war and how it ended. "The other mailgirls got him to wank me off in front of them."<br><br>Destinee chose to be serious about that. "How did you feel?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Orgasmic." Destinee ran her fingers close to Jackson's outer lips as she spread her legs to encourage the attention.<br><br>"And what did he think of it?" Destinee asked.<br><br>Jackson smiled at the memory. "The little I took notice of him, he was being staid and office-like. Acting like it was a requirement, that we forced him to do. But then he may have been playing up to all of us there." She thought on that for a moment. "Of course he was," Jackson decided.<br><br>"What else is going on there?" Destinee pried.<br><br>"They're trying to make us more public." Which was what Jackson really wanted to get off her chest.<br><br>Destinee paused her gentle wanking of the mailgirl to make eye contact. "I didn't think they could do that?"<br><br>Jackson looked her back. "They can. We're going to be on the tele." She looked unsure.<br><br>But Destinee laughed. "You're going to be big time! Friday night SBS?"<br><br>Jackson smirked. "I don't think they do that anymore."<br><br>Destinee shook her head. "Oh, I think they do. It's usually pretty quiet here Fridays between about 9 and 11. We call it the SBS effect."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "I'll have to make that the time to come in."<br><br>Destinee got back to stimulating her client. "Well, I can tell you that you won't need an appointment." She had Jackson gently pushing back against her fingers. Then Destinee remembered. "Oh, I shouldn't mention this, client confidentiality and all that. But I've had two girls who come in together who are trying locate a mailgirl."<br><br>Jackson started, tensed back from Destinee's touch. "What, they heard that they might find one here?"<br><br>Destinee relaxed her back down, working her fingers back around Jackson's thighs. "No, they just talk about mailgirls all the time."<br><br>Jackson wondered at that. With no publicity coming out of Harada, she had hoped that everyone had lost interest. But then she knew what was coming. Still she tried to laugh it off. "That's all I need, a fan club. Well, on the other hand, if we're going to be promoted out in the world soon..."<br><br>Destinee shook her head. "This is so not like you, indecisive and defensive. Seize the day! Carpe Diem, whatever that means, that was usually you. What has happened?"<br><br>Jackson flopped back down. "It's like I was telling you before about the new boss. I've lost my agency. I guess I didn't see it coming. And really didn't realise how much I lost until I started telling you around it. I thought I was still a player, what with the strategising with the other mailgirls and the sneaking out to shop and dine with the new boss. But I'm starting to think that in fact it is all the opposite to being a player. It's more about drifting along in the current."<br><br>Destinee rested her hands on Jackson's lower back, just above the rise of her bottom. "What can you do?" she asked.<br><br>"Good question." Jackson pondered her situation for a moment. Suddenly she seemed energised. "I have an idea," she announced. She and Destinee shared smiles. "Now," she ordered Destinee, "wank me off. Be as firm as you can. I need a good hard orgasm." Destinee got to work, checking that Jackson was wet then prodding a finger, then another into Jackson. "That's it," Jackson groaned. "Make me cum," she urged. "And keep going until I tell you to stop."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jan Stephenson strode past Betty Cuthbert giving the PA a quick smile. She knocked on Shane Crawford's door and waited, lanky and serious until she got called in. Finding him alone, the statuesque mailgirl decided to play up to him sweeping her wavy blonde hair off her long pale neck and back behind her ear, then teasingly ran a finger from that ear down to her shoulder, turning to look coquettishly at the admiring manager. Of course she was the distance of his room away and Shane was safely behind his desk.<br><br>Realising how she was teasing him, Shane affected to be serious. "I'm quite busy," he pretended, "did you come with a message for me?"<br><br>Jan stepped forward and enticingly licked her crooked finger while pretending to think about why she was there. "Oh yes," she recalled after a moment, "there is a message." She paused, appearing to try to remember it as Shane ogled her. "Stuart sent me. He wanted to know if you were free for lunch."<br><br>Shane smiled and spread his arms dramatically. "You can see how busy I am," he tried. "Snowed under."<br><br>"It doesn't snow here," Jan noted dryly. "Shall I tell him one o'clock?" Shane seemed to yield to that and nodded. "By the way," Jan asked, "what's going on with the TV show?"<br><br>"Wish I knew," Shane admitted. "Then I would tell you and everyone else to get you all off my back." Jan laughed. "Tell me," Shane asked, "how's he settling in on the eleventh floor?"<br><br>Jan reflected his laugh. "He's the only one trying to work there while the builders are finishing the fit-out. They have to try and work around him."<br><br>"You're not worried about going up there, being with him alone?"<br><br>"The strict family man, I'm sure he wouldn't touch me. Mortal sin and all that."<br><br>"They're the worst, they're the ones you have to watch out for," Shane warned with that boyish 'not me' look on his face. Jan shook her head in friendly disbelief. But then Shane became serious. "I've heard stories. If there's anything you need me to do..."<br><br>Jan laughed at that and gave Shane a 'what, really?' look which of course he chose not to understand. "And those builders," he remembered, "how are they all treating you? Shouldn't you be careful of them?"<br><br>"Ah well, you see," Jan started. She then stopped while she considered whether she should just leave her response there with Shane in a confusion of concern about naked mailgirls having to confront a bevy of builders whenever they had to attend to Stuart. "Those builders..." she continued, teasingly. She shimmied her shoulders as if she was showing off her breasts — and obviously more — to a group of leering workmen. What could a mailgirl do?<br><br>Shane almost had his tongue hanging right out of his mouth. Jan would have to complete her story before he did himself an injury. "The builders," she restarted, "are all women. And conscientious. They are either concentrating on what they have to do to finish the job. Or giving us mailgirls the occasional pitying look when we have to pass them on the way to Stuart."<br><br>"Where did we find them?" Shane gasped, exasperated.<br><br>"I was wondering the same thing," Jan responded with a smile, "but for different reasons." She made to head out the door then stopped. "I'll tell Stuart one o'clock, then," she added equally mischievously. Shane was about to retort when Jan turned back towards him. "Oh, I don't have to," she reported. "Here he is!"<br><br>And Stuart Broad walked past Jan without acknowledging her and straight up to Shane's desk. "I understand you are ready to go to lunch," he told Shane. And added for insurance, "my shout."<br><br>Sitting opposite Shane in the cafe, Stuart watched him closely. "You're looking at the waitress," Stuart cautioned.<br><br>Shane looked back Stuart missing any menace in Stuart's tone. "Well," Shane agreed, "she is worth looking at." He smiled. "And I am not being disrespectful, am I? She is an attractive woman and I am not upsetting her or anyone else by enjoying her beauty." He crossed his arms with a look of daring. And a challenge to Stuart. What might he do or say when she came back.<br><br>Stuart remained unimpressed. "You are married?" he reminded Shane.<br><br>Shane nodded. "I am indeed. And I am looking at the waitress. The two are mutually exclusive."<br><br>Stuart shook his head. "I think you'll find that phrase doesn't mean what you think it means."<br><br>Shane smiled back. "You don't make friends easily do you? And I know, I'll get a dog or maybe two dogs if I want to make friends, according to your outlook on life. But I know what matters to me. And I prefer the company of happy and contented colleagues." He stared at Stuart who kept a poker face. So Shane continued. "And you are not contented. What is it that you want? Why are you like you are?"<br><br>Stuart took a breath before he responded. "I am determined get things working properly in the office. Things need to change. The attitude is all wrong. And it starts with the mailgirls. I know they won't like me."<br><br>Shane rocked back in his chair. "I wouldn't have thought you cared," he suggested.<br><br>"But it's the disrespect," Stuart tried to explain.<br><br>Shane gave him a surprised look. "Ah, you want them to respect you."<br><br>Stuart looked sternly back. "I want them to realise where their real place is in this company."<br><br>"What's that?" Shane countered.<br><br>"They are at the bottom, the most disposable of employees, and morally..." Stuart gnashed his teeth at the thought of the mailgirls flaunting their bodies around him, revelling in their immodesty. He didn't tell Shane this, but Shane could read his expression and got a pretty good idea.<br><br>"Just as well the TV show didn't interview you," Shane noted.<br><br>Stuart seemed emboldened, taking on that challenge. "Next time. Now let me demonstrate what I mean." He called over to the waitress Shane had been ogling who was now leaning against the counter. She wandered over and smiled down at him. Stuart smiled back up at her. She was tall with short straight dark-hair, thin but showing a prominent bust. She let the men get an eyeful. "Would you like to be a mailgirl?" Stuart asked suddenly.<br><br>The waitress looked at him, nonplussed. "What's that?" she asked.<br><br>Stuart was caught by surprise. "You don't know?"<br><br>"If I knew would I be asking you?" the waitress drawled, possibly aping Stuart's American twang. "I assume you are offering me this job because you think it pays better than waitressing?"<br><br>Stuart nodded. 'It sure does."<br><br>"And what would I have to do?" the waitress asked.<br><br>Stuart looked past her as he explained. "Deliver mail."<br><br>Shane rapped his fingers on the table. "Tell her," he urged.<br><br>Stuart kept his gaze focussed past the waitress. "Without your clothes on," he added.<br><br>The waitress shook her head. "You're kidding!" she exclaimed. She stared at Stuart who made it clear that he was serious. The waitress swore and shook her head. But she remained hovering over the two men rather than scamper. Stuart reached into his wallet and offered a business card to her. She studied it. "I've never heard of this company," she noted somewhat calmer after her outburst. "It can't be a very good company if you want women to walk naked around there all the time. What do you do, stare at them as they show off for you?" Stuart said nothing. She kept the card, put it in her pocket. And then gave Stuart a serious look. "I'll mention it at my study group," she told him. Then she gave him a smile for the customer. "No more orders at the moment?" The men shook their heads. She went back to the counter.<br><br>Stuart looked triumphantly at Shane. "You see. She's interested, she took the card."<br><br>Shane looked bemused. "Didn't you hear her? She is going to tell her study group. She's going to pray for you. She's probably also going to organise a demonstration."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After the cafe closed the waitress and a colleague were cleaning and arranging the tables and chairs. She had already told the bulk of the story. "So I told them I'd mention it to my study group," she added.<br><br>The colleague started. "You never mentioned a study group..." Then she realised, as they both laughed. "So are you tempted?"<br><br>The waitress smiled. "You never know. I may just turn up there one day and find out what it's all about. Ask to see this Stuart Broad," as she read his job title on the card. "Big man," she added, "decision maker."<br><br>The colleague waited until they made eye contact to check. "You've never heard of mailgirls?"<br><br>The waitress screwed up her face. "What do you think?" They both howled with laughter.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay looked up as the mailgirl entered her office. She held her stern glare watching her approach the desk. "Sit down Jackson, please," she ordered.<br><br>Jackson gave her a curious smile. "You're very formal."<br><br>Lindsay did not change her tone. "Not at all," she replied without any warmth. "Nice to catch up. Sorry, I've been distracted." Lindsay looked Jackson in the eye then smiled dangerously, like a Cheshire cat. "I've been missing out," she added.<br><br>Jackson looked concerned. "You have?"<br><br>Lindsay continued. "Indeed. I hear that you and Mitch put on quite a show."<br><br>Jackson sat back in her chair, relaxed her hands on the armrests. "Oh, you heard."<br><br>Lindsay nodded, ever so slightly. "I overhear things. Not everything that happens in this office happens without me hearing about it."<br><br>Jackson pulled a confused face. "A strange way of putting it."<br><br>Lindsay ignored that. "And now here we are, the team. Me behind my desk running this company and you sitting there completely exposed, waiting for me to give you an order." Lindsay picked up a pen, then flattened a sheet of paper on the desk in front of her, poised as if to write something and then stopped. "I'm curious to see if your tongue is sharper in this situation. Completely bare and vulnerable to my whims. While, look at me, dressed like I work here."<br><br>Jackson did not respond. But she tightened her grip on the seat. Then rather than cover her breasts she arched her back and spread her legs a little.<br><br>Lindsay ignored that and continued. "Do you like this, the humiliation?"<br><br>"No," Jackson responded, "it's not humiliation."<br><br>Lindsay continued as if she had not heard the negation. "I think you like it. Sitting naked and exposed there..."<br><br>Jackson sighed "...remembering being free to endure..."<br><br>Lindsay patted the corner of her desk. "You could of course..."<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "No, not in the mood," she responded firmly.<br><br>Lindsay relented. "I won't push the issue. I'll let you contemplate it later when you are alone." She gave Jackson her most triumphant smile. "Maybe when you are watching mailgirls on the TV." Lindsay held her stare.<br><br>Jackson started at that. She was not pleased at all at Lindsay's insinuations. But she decided to push things. Spreading her legs wide, Jackson ran a teasing finger down her stomach. "Maybe," she cooed, "you don't know what you are missing out on." She held Lindsay's stare as she let her finger stray as low as her bush. Jackson felt a very small pang. She was enjoying this.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily turned to Cara as the stripper introduced as Candy strode naked off the stage, breaking her sex goddess character to collect her clothes while about half of the dozen or so men around the stage clapped politely. "I don't see the point," Emily whispered.<br><br>An old guy gripping a beer tapped Cara on the shoulder with his free hand. "You up next luv," he asked. Her shoulder was bare courtesy of the thin straps of the little black dress Emily had insisted she wore.<br><br>Cara glared at the man's hand that was still close to her bare arm. "In your nightmares," she snapped at him.<br><br>"Sorry," added Emily, "we're here for research purposes only." Which seemed to satisfy the old guy who wandered off as the DJ pumped up the volume heralding the next act.<br><br>Cara returned to Emily's issue. "The point is that men want to see naked women. And they are prepared to pay."<br><br>"I don't get it," Emily complained. "The blokes here can't even take their cocks out and have a wank. I don't understand why they would do that to themselves. Or I guess they could cum in their pants."<br><br>Cara shook her head. "You're over-thinking it," she warned.<br><br>Another man came over. He was middle aged and visibly muscular. He was also security. "I'm sorry but I'm going to have to ask you two to leave. I did warn you."<br><br>Emily smiled at him warmly. "Aren't we good for business?"<br><br>He returned her smile and shook his head. "That is the problem. The girls are complaining you are distracting the punters. Receipts are down. So unless you quickly think of something to fix that, you're out."<br><br>"We have a right to be here," Cara started.<br><br>"We'll go quietly," Emily assured the manager.<br><br>Cara gripped her sister's arm to stop her leaving. "You'll hear from our lawyer," she asserted. Emily gave her a confused look as the manager smiled indulgently. "He's over there," Cara pointed, as her sister took over and dragged her towards the door. She had pointed at the old guy who thought she was a stripper. He noticed and waved vaguely back, clearly unsure why she had pointed at him. "His name is Rake," Cara shouted as Emily got her through the door and out of the room.<br><br>Out in the fresh air, Cara turned to Emily. "What are we going to do now?" she demanded. "I'm pumped and up for some action."<br><br>Emily gleamed back. "I have an idea," she hinted, getting out her phone to send a few messages. She checked the replies and smiled to herself. Then she looked at her sister. "Trust me," she told her.<br><br>Cara found herself in the back seat of a car with Emily. It was being driven by the lighting guy from Mailgirl In The Office. The sound guy was in the passenger seat. "I'm Ray and this is Steven, in case you've forgotten," he told the girls. "I'm not sure why we agreed to return to the scene of the crime," he added.<br><br>"Because you can't resist us," Emily giggled. Cara looked nonplussed. Clocking her concern, Emily patted her sister's hand. "It's all under control," she soothed.<br><br>They soon arrived at the Union Theatre. It was closed, dark and silent in the night. Emily led them to the stage door. "Just as well I remembered the combination," she revealed as she punched a four digit code into the door which clicked open.<br><br>"What's going on?" Cara worried as the crew followed the sisters in.<br><br>"It's time for another performance," Emily smiled as she flicked the stage lights on and strode in.<br><br>Hearing footsteps behind the crew, Cara stopped and turned. She found that Sarah and Bill had joined them. The other office workers from the cast of Mailgirl In The Office. Each carried a bottle of something not yet identifiable to the others. But certainly alcohol.<br><br>Emily waited for all the others to join her on the stage. "Right," she announced, "time for a performance." The stage was bare but not for long. Ray and Steven dragged two desks and three chairs from the wings onto the stage to again set up the basics of an office. "Thought they might have just left that stuff there," Emily smiled, nodding her thanks at the two crewmen.<br><br>"We'll take our usual places," Sarah announced on behalf of herself and Bill. They plonked down at the desk with two chairs, facing the other desk. Bill unscrewed one of the bottles and looked around. "No glasses," Sarah realised. Bill shrugged, took a swig from the bottle and passed it to Sarah who did the same.<br><br>Cara looked around. "So what happens now?" she asked her sister as they stood a short distance away from the other two.<br><br>Emily put her hands on her hips. "It's my turn," she announced. "I'm going to direct." Cara looked at her still nonplussed. Emily smiled. "I'm playing Cara, I guess. So you're playing Emily."<br><br>Cara looked a little worried. "What do you mean?"<br><br>Emily knew exactly what she meant. "Come on sis, you're amongst friends."<br><br>Cara looked to Ray and Steven who stood nearby, happily leering at her, expectant. "I wouldn't call them friends," she complained to Emily. Which did not stop the two of them licking their lips as they clearly enjoyed Cara's discomfort.<br><br>Emily looked over at the duo, both were now making hourglass gestures at Cara with their hands. She then looked to Cara. "No, you're right. About the friends thing. I wouldn't call them friends." But she looked back to the crew. "Better get to work," she told them.<br><br>The two men quickly crossed over to Cara. Before she could think to do anything, one of them lifted her dress over her head. The other one quickly undid Cara's bra and slid down her panties.<br><br>"Mailgirl!" Emily squeaked in delight at her now naked sister.<br><br>Before Cara could respond to that, Bill help up a slip of paper he had found somewhere and called out "Mailgirl, delivery!" at Cara. Taken by surprise, she complied and strode over to attempt to take the sheet from him. "Not so fast," he taunted. "You don't even know who it's for yet."<br><br>Sarah smiled with intent. "Kneel like a mailgirl while you're waiting," she ordered.<br><br>Cara got to her knees, kept them together but found she was teetering.<br><br>"It's not easy if you don't practice," Emily observed. "Try spreading your knees." Cara shuffled her knees apart. "Wider," Emily suggested encouragingly. Cara looked at her sister aghast, but obeyed her. "Doesn't she look a treat?" Emily asked the others. Cara suddenly realised her predicament, it had all happened so fast. She shuddered. She was naked up on the stage. They were all dressed. And... She did not know...<br><br>The crewmen called out their appreciation. "I like her breasts better than yours," Bill called over to Emily.<br><br>"You'll keep," she snapped back. "Now the message," she reminded Bill.<br><br>"Oh yes," he told their trainee mailgirl, "this message is for the boss."<br><br>Cara looked perplexed. "Who's the boss?" she asked. This was still surreal, she decided.<br><br>Emily butted in. "That would be me." She went over and sat at the other desk. Bill handed Cara the sheet of paper. She took it, stood up and walked self consciously across the stage. After handing the sheet to her sister, Cara stood waiting. Emily shook her head in dismay. "I think you're going to need a lot more training," she added with sharp intent. Cara looked to her sister, careful not to say anything to antagonise her further. But Emily was now oozing managerial assurance as she pushed her chair away from the desk. "I need you to bend over my knee for your next lesson."<br><br>"Imaginative," Cara snorted. But she stood there.<br><br>"Come on, sis," Emily asked, "a promise is a promise."<br><br>Cara looked confused. "I didn't promise anything," she complained.<br><br>Emily laughed as she grabbed her sister's wrist to drag her closer. "Oh, that's right. You didn't promise, I did!"<br><br>Cara let her sister arrange her across her knees. She waited for the slaps to start as Emily gently patted the sides of her bare bottom. How did this happen? Cara wondered, she was still coming to terms that she was naked, on her knees and about to be punished. And, she realised to her horror, it was all getting a little exciting. She let out a slight moan, hoping no one heard.<br><br>Unseen to her, Emily nodded at the crewmen who both undid their pants and got their hard cocks out. Ray was the first to get to the prone mailgirl. He had no problems imbedding himself in her. Cara gasped in surprise and pleasure. Emily gestured Steven to come around. As she stroked the side of her prone sister's face with one hand, Emily guided Steven's cock into Cara's mouth with the other. Cara found herself in a rhythm, pressing herself back against Ray while Emily pistoned her head up and down on Steven.<br><br>"Change," Emily called out, and sure enough Cara was getting fucked by Steven with Ray in her mouth while her sister ran a hand gently through her hair. Cara realised that she was enjoying it, getting off on the surprise, the attention. And the sex. And her thrusts back at Steven grew more urgent then became orgasmic as she groaned her pleasure around Ray's cock in her mouth.<br><br>Ray and Steven shared her moment as they thrust away, elated that it had worked out. Both of them soon came, not long long after Cara had a long loud orgasm. After all three of them were spent, they hastily withdrew and buttoned their pants back up. Emily gripped her her sister and stood her back up. Cara tottered the short way to lean against the desk as she recovered.<br><br>"So did you enjoy it?" Emily asked her.<br><br>Cara was still coming back down. "Ummm..."<br><br>Emily smiled warmly. "See, sex isn't so bad."<br><br>"I'm not a virgin," Cara argued.<br><br>Emily giggled. "Could have fooled me." She smiled at the crewmen then at Cara. "And I'm your twin, so I should know. Anyway you're certainly not now."<br><br>Cara crossed her arms across her breasts. "I'm just choosy. And discrete." Which seemed odd since Cara had not bothered in any way to hide herself below the waist.<br><br>Emily laughed at her naked sister. "Discrete? Not any more, sis. And I think you liked it."<br><br>Cara smiled. "Well, maybe. You didn't get any." She looked over to the other actors. "And Sarah and Bill only watched too." It was true. The two of them had just sat there swigging their wine while watching Cara's performance.<br><br>Emily gave the appearance that she was thinking deeply about what Cara had said. "That can only mean one thing," Emily concluded.<br><br>"What?" asked Cara.<br><br>Emily beamed. "We'll have to do it again!" She looked over at the other desk. Sara stood up and began to loosen her clothes.<br><br>Bill stared up at her as she transformed. "I need a mailgirl to deliver a message," he told her.<br><br>In the back of an Uber taking them home, Cara turned to Emily. "How did you know I was going to enjoy fucking those two at the same time?"<br><br>Emily smirked. "I'm your sister."<br><br>Cara studied her hard. "You've been reading my journal!"<br><br>Emily snorted. "You've been reading my journal? How very Jane Austen of you!"<br><br>Cara looked hard at her sister. "That's not a denial."<br><br>"I'm your sister," Emily insisted.<br><br>"And that's not a denial either!" Cara exploded. She punched Emily lightly on the shoulder. Emily punched her back. "Hey!" Cara complained. They looked into each other's eyes and dissolved into giggles.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Alone in the change room, Kimiko looked up from her spot as the door slammed. Away in her corner she watched Lauryn stamp into the mezzanine. Lauryn looked foul again. "Come over here," Kimiko suggested gently but loud enough not to be ignored.<br><br>Lauryn groaned. "Argh, not you too. Does everybody know?"<br><br>Kimiko beckoned her over. Lauren responded, out of politeness, she told herself. She stepped slowly over towards where the other mailgirl sat.<br><br>Patting the bench next to her as an invitation, Kimiko looked up to confirm Lauryn's suspicions. "Seems so. Sit down. Tell me," she insisted.<br><br>Lauryn sat but stiffly, uncertain. "If you rather, I won't. I'm trying to..." she started to say.<br><br>Kimiko accepted that. "In that case..." She holds out her arms, and Lauryn paused for a moment, then leant in to accept her embrace. Kimiko held her firmly, her chin on Lauryn's shoulder.<br><br>"I don't need anything sexual," Lauryn warned her.<br><br>Kimiko looked the other mailgirl in the eye, very close. "That's all right, you weren't going to get any," she responded. Then added quietly: "Unless you ask." She held Lauryn tight to her, breasts crushing breasts, shoulders tight together.<br><br>Lauryn sighed, with a little hint of pleasure. "Thanks, I didn't expect."<br><br>Kimiko laughed a little, stroked Lauryn's hair with slow and soft feeling. "I do see things and I do care," she offered.<br><br>Lauryn looked thankfully into her eyes. "You don't say much. I guess you don't talk unless you feel the need?"<br><br>Kimiko agreed. "Something like that. Tell me, have you got anyone?"<br><br>Lauryn thought about it as she gripped Kimiko tighter. "Only you at the moment. I didn't expect this but thanks."<br><br>Urged by Kimiko, Lauryn's spilt the story of her latest clash with Stuart, with Kimiko insisting that she was not nosy or prying and that Lauryn should share only as much as she wanted. Getting enough of the story out of her, Kimiko asked "So you want to fuck him up?"<br><br>Lauryn eased out of Kimiko's embrace to face her confidante. "That's more like you," she noted grimly. Which cloaked over her realisation that Kimiko's caresses had relaxed her. And maybe a bit more.<br><br>"Well maybe." Kimiko looked like she was plotting. And totally unaware that she had been at all seductive. She looked hard at Lauryn. "Can you think of anything?" she asked.<br><br>At that moment, Jackson stormed into the room, venting about Lindsay. And the TV show. Kimiko and Lauryn gave each other looks that said, this is not our usual experience of Jackson. Something clearly was up. Lauryn parked her own woes.<br><br>"Anything we can do?" she asked Jackson, just before Kimiko could ask too.<br><br>Jackson was exasperated. "I don't know if I want to punch the wall or wank myself into oblivion."<br><br>"Punch the wall," Kimiko replied.<br><br>"Wank yourself to oblivion," Lauryn added dryly.<br><br>"Thanks for the clear advice," Jackson told them, lightening a little.<br><br>Lauryn stood up, poising to give Jackson a hug when Wendy strode in.<br><br>Their supervisor, conservatively dressed as ever went up to the three naked women. "Is everything all right?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson spoke up first. "Oh, everything is fine," she tried. She knew that Wendy wouldn't pry further, it just wasn't her way. "Do you know the date for the broadcast yet?" she continued, as if that was the stress.<br><br>Wendy shook her head. "In the unlikely event that I find out before you, I promise to tell when I know." And gave her a knowing smile.<br><br>Jackson nodded, seemed to agree that was how things usually went. Kimiko went back to her laptop, concentrating as if nothing affected her. Lauryn tried to catch Kimiko's eye without success, trying to find out how serious her unpredictable colleague was. Would she really try to fuck up Stuart?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Fanny strode brazenly into the open plan area of Level 10, among the IT staff. She looked around for a moment and then spotted her prey. There had been the usual buzz around the floor as the programmers shared their wisdom, typed or clicked through their work. All that came to a sudden silence. Fanny focussed on her destination but she stopped, aware that she was the cause of the consternation. She glared around the room and enjoyed the moment. None of the IT staff were going to say anything to her. And so what if they stared.<br><br>She smiled and continued her progress quickly. Soon she stood over a desk while its inhabitant attempted to keep working at what was on his screen despite knowing that the provocative mailgirl as well as a number of his colleagues were all watching him.<br><br>"Simon," she asked gently. He did not answer.<br><br>Brian Taylor was at his desk next to the two of them. "The lady's talking to you, Simon," he helpfully called over.<br><br>"Fuck off Brian," Fanny snapped. He looked at her, surprised. "Leave us alone," she ordered in a slightly less terse tone.<br><br>"Okay." He retreated both verbally and physically.<br><br>Fanny sat down in the vacated seat. Finally Simon looked over, a little wary. "I just wanted to see how you were," she calmed him.<br><br>He shrugged. "You could have been a little more discrete."<br><br>Fanny shrugged back with a bounce of her breasts. "Not my style," she stated. That did it. They both laughed.<br><br>That broke the ice. Simon looked Fanny in the eyes. "Why do you do it?" he asked, "mailgirl?" There seemed to be a level of respect.<br><br>Fanny smiled. "When you look like this and you're given the opportunity why wouldn't you do it?" She shimmied her breasts at the IT worker.<br><br>Simon shook his head. "I could think of a lot of reasons." Fanny gave him an enquiring look. "Like accepted levels of modesty, the stability of modern society, keeping the charms for someone special..."<br><br>"So we break through the norms and what do we get?"<br><br>"Anarchy?"<br><br>"And is that a bad thing?"<br><br>Simon smiled at her challenge. "I think I can see what you are getting at. But we're talking about an entire breakdown of societal conventions."<br><br>Fanny laughed. "I'm sure that Mr Harada was not thinking of that when he came up with the idea."<br><br>"What was he thinking?" Simon wondered.<br><br>Fanny gave Simon a serious look. "From all my research, I think he was just looking for a way for the company to let him look at naked women during work hours."<br><br>Simon chortled. "The bored multi-millionaire. I understand it's a type. He's going to be rapt when segment screens." Fanny rolled her eyes. "I reckon it's a dopamine thing," Simon continued. "They need to find a way to keep themselves stimulated after they find that they are successful beyond any of their expectations."<br><br>Fanny looked interested. "That's your observation?"<br><br>Simon shook his head. "If only. No, it is on some research and organisational study threads I've been following. I'm interested in work organisation theory. It helps me contextualise my programming. I thought that would have been your thing too."<br><br>Fanny leant forward in her seat, now definitely interested. "It is my thing. But I think you may have come across some studies I don't know about." She stopped for a moment to regroup her thoughts. "You and I must definitely talk more about this. But I actually have a message for you. Belinda would like you to see her in HR. She wants to follow up on the session the other day, make sure that everything is okay with you."<br><br>Simon nodded. "I'll just wrap this up and go and see her."<br><br>Both of them recognised that something interesting had occurred between them. Fanny got up from Brian's seat, rolled her shoulders back, stretching herself back to comfortable now she was again standing. "See you," she smiled as she turned, leaving Simon to stare at her firm, shapely bottom as she strode out of the room.<br><br>Brian walked back over and slapped Simon on the back. "You're doing well there, mate," he cackled. "What did you two talk about?" he smirked.<br><br>Simon shook his head at his colleague. "The imminent collapse of Western civilisation," he smiled. Adding with pity in his voice. "And how some dinosaurs are going to be left behind by the new paradigm."<br><br>Brian did not let up. "So the world is going to be taken over by naked office women?"<br><br>Simon smiled. "And what is wrong with that?" And finished with his work for the moment, he got up to go and see what HR wanted to discuss.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson walked into the change room and said just one word. "Tuesday."<br><br>Everyone got it straight away. Well, everyone who was there except Pam. "What?' she asked, not as tuned as Annette, Jan and Kimiko.<br><br>Wendy had followed Jackson into the change room and saw the look on four of the five faces. "Tuesday," Annette told her. At that moment Pam clicked.<br><br>"How do you know?" Wendy asked the group.<br><br>Jan gestured at Jackson. "She was always going to find out first." She looked around. "So what do we do?"<br><br>"What can we do?" Annette pointed out correctly.<br><br>"Well, we can watch it at my place," Jackson suggested. She looked over to Kimiko who was, for once, regarding the rest of them, ignoring her computer screen for the moment. "Are you in?" Jackson called over to her.<br><br>Kimiko smiled back. "Sure, why not?"<br><br>Jackson looked at Wendy who shook her head. "I'm sure you want mailgirls only," she observed. She was correct, but no one said anything. They were like that, considerate. Jackson looked around taking headcount. Fanny and Lauryn were the only two missing who needed to be invited.<br><br>As if on cue, Lauryn entered the room. She did not look happy. Annette asked her first. "Have you heard the news?" Of course she hadn't.<br><br>Jackson explained about Tuesday and then invited her to her place to watch. "The others are coming."<br><br>Jan suddenly realised. "Partners?" She asked.<br><br>Jackson smiled with a glint in her eye. "No, just us. First function for the Harada Mailgirls Social Club."<br><br>Pam piped up. "What do we wear?"<br><br>Annette gasped at that. "Girl, it's after hours!"<br><br>Kimiko looked back at her screen then spoke up. "It's official now, I guess. There's an email that's gone around. The speculation is over." She smiled at the others. "I guess that calls for a celebration." She closed her laptop, got up on the bench and spread her legs. Pretty quickly she had a hand down there. She let out a groan of pleasure.<br><br>Annette smiled over at her while the others pretended not to notice as Kimiko grunted loudly. "Oh wow, she's at it again," Annette noted dryly.<br><br>Kimiko smiled back as she dug both hands in. "Anyone got a better idea?" she challenged. Then she stopped, let her head fall back for moment. "I need something more!" she cried out. She raised her head and looked around. "Wendy," she smiled.<br><br>"No," Wendy recoiled.<br><br>"Wendy," Kimiko demanded, then licked a finger and tried to get a rhythm going on her pussy. She was frustrated it was not working for her. "Mailgirls can require the fabrics to help them out, right Jackson?" she called.<br><br>"Something like that," Jackson smiled looked straight at Wendy who found she had nowhere to hide.<br><br>Wendy took a step towards Kimiko who was on her back with her legs spread and was rubbing her thighs, thrusting at the older dressed woman, their supervisor.<br><br>"Fingers," Kimiko pleaded, her demand drawing the Wendy closer. Her supervisor sat down on the bench near Kimiko's lower half and reached over to tentatively move one hand towards Kimiko's opening. Kimiko grabbed her hand and pulled it to her crotch. "Go hard," Kimiko insisted. Wendy understandably started tentatively but with Kimiko forcing her pelvis up her hand, make the contact hard. Wendy found she had one finger then two imbedded in the mailgirl.<br><br>Wendy leaned closer for comfort with her fingers prodding deep in Kimiko, something the mailgirl noted. She grabbed Wendy by the neck and pulled her face down. "Tongue now!" she demanded. Wendy had little chance to escape and found her mouth on Kimiko's clit. "Yes," the mailgirl urged as Wendy got to work. "Cumming!!!"<br><br>Annette looked over at Jackson. "Never ceases to amaze," she observed.<br><br>"Are we allowed to do that?" Pam wondered, looking perplexed at the performance.<br><br>"Apparently," Lauryn told her. And smiled happily for the first time in a while.<br><br>Throughout the office as word spread, others were making their own arrangements. Most choose to watch it at home. Fanny was still in the IT section with Brian who told her. He looked around and snared Rich. He then looked back to Fanny. "We're thinking of watching it in a bar. Our local. Want to join us?"<br><br>Fanny smiled benevolently. "I think not, Brian, but thanks for the invitation." She strode to the exit, as ever aware of exactly what she was doing.<br><br>No one had thought to ask Lindsay where she was planning to watch the show. Maybe it is early days, she considered. Slightly desperate she stepped outside and found Betty Cuthbert as usual busy on her computer. Regardless she interrupted her. "What are you thinking of doing on Tuesday night?" Lindsay asked her. She tried to keep her tone neutral, not pleading or anything like that.<br><br>Betty look up at Lindsay, confused for a moment either by the familiarity of Lindsay's tone or perhaps the concept that she needed to be somewhere on Tuesday and the locale was of interest to her boss. Then she realised. "Oh, I wasn't planning to watch it," she answered tartly. And that was that.<br><br>When Fanny returned to the mezzanine, Wendy was coming back from the washroom wiping her face with a hand towel, avoiding any eye contact. Kimiko had perched on the bench lightly rubbing her pussy with one hand, pinching a nipple with the other. The other mailgirls were standing silently all looking alternately to Wendy and Kimiko.<br><br>"All right," Fanny demanded, "what did I miss?"`

                    title: "Pt. 10",
                    subtitle: "Australian mailgirls turned upside down, now on the TV.", 
                    content: `Jan Stephenson was feeling a little wicked as she strode into the open plan area of the tenth floor. The tall athletic mailgirl knew that she always got a lot of attention from the predominately male IT staff working at their desks between her and Mitchell Johnson's office near far wall, which was her destination. It was now his office since he was no longer the boss of the office but assigned to special projects.<br><br>Jan had been a promising talent in the IT department when she used to work in clothes and had long ago rationalised the attention her totally naked body got from her once colleagues. And she played up to them. She sidled up to her old boss's desk and stood up straight in front of him knowing that he was staring at her firm breasts and small, hard nipples. God, she enjoyed this.<br><br>"Les," she purred at her former boss, "do you have any projects for me?" As she asked him, she flexed a knee wide knowing that her slit was now at his eye level. And he was looking straight there, speechless. "Oh well," Jan dramatically sighed, brushing her hair back in place which also shimmered her breasts for the IT manager's appreciation, "maybe next time," as she continued on towards Mitch's office. Les would never guess that she had hacked the mailgirls app and was now working on backdooring the rest of the office comms.<br><br>Jan found Mitch clearly biding his time in his isolated office. "Busy?" she asked him.<br><br>"What do you think?" he smiled. Jan smiled back at the former boss who had always been caring and respectful to her. She gave him an apologetic look with the news that Lindsay Davenport, his replacement, wanted to meet him 'as soon as he was free'. Which meant straight away. He got, ready to face the new boss.<br><br>Lindsay Davenport looked straight into Mitch when he entered her office. "You get a lot of mailgirl messages from the rest of the office," she started. He found it hard to tell if she was admiring or suspicious.<br><br>Mitch replied, offhand. "Most of those are from Shane. And most of those are premium wine tips or restaurant suggestions." Shane Crawford, deputy formerly to Mitch and now to Lindsay, was in the habit of what he called 'enhancing the work environment' or as others may think of it, avoiding his office responsibilities. So Mitch's assertion was plausible. Except that Mitch was in on Jan's hack and let the mailgirls use his office as a safe haven.<br><br>Lindsay seemed unconvinced though. "I don't see that many mailgirls on my floor," she pointed out. Shane's office was next to hers after all.<br><br>Mitch smiled. "You wouldn't see them coming and going from Shane's office when you are at your desk, I'm sure that there are many," he tried. "Maybe you're not using them enough? Or working too hard?" He made a mental note to warn the mailgirls to be more visible to Lindsay. But boy did he enjoy riling her. His wife was right. Lindsay could do nothing to him about it. He was untouchable.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane was back at the Sad Cafe. And was being served by the same waitress as the previous day, the one with attitude.<br><br>"I see you didn't bring your friend," she noted, waiting for his order. Referring to Stuart Broad, the manager newly arrived from the States with some problematic views about mailgirls. And about Australians in general. Shane was glad to be free of him. Even though there was a reason he was there alone.<br><br>"How did things go in the study group?" Shane countered the waitress with a grin suggesting he had worked her out. "And he's not my friend." Shane knew the study group did not exist, yet he imagined getting an invitation to debate the morality of naked women wandering an office with such people.<br><br>"Not your friend. That much was obvious," the waitress answered back. "Tell me, can he really get me work as a mailgirl?" For some reason, Stuart had held the opportunity out to her. Shane had no idea what that was about at all.<br><br>"I have no idea," Shane told her. "Depends if we're actually hiring. But you do have the attributes for it."<br><br>"What does that mean?" she asked, suspicious.<br><br>Shane gave her his boyish smile, the one designed to disarm. "It means that you are not unattractive and you are clearly capable of spending long periods on your feet."<br><br>"Thanks, I'll put that on my CV. Now what do you want to eat?"<br><br>Shane told her, and then looked deeply at her. "I'm here for a private meeting. Discrete and all of that. So if you could respect that when my guest appears, that would be great."<br><br>The waitress smiled. "I guess so. Although I need to discuss the ethics of that with my study group, you know." She smiled. Then thought for a moment. "Tell me, are you imagining me naked, in your office delivering messages?" She even posed, breasts thrust a little forward, legs astride.<br><br>Shane looked her up and down. "Well now I have a picture," he agreed.<br><br>"A picture?" She looked worried.<br><br>Shane shook his head. "A mental image," he corrected.<br><br>"Ah okay." She looked relieved. "Is it hard?" she wondered.<br><br>Shane stared down at his crotch. "Not particularly," he wondered.<br><br>She realised and giggled. "Not you, the job."<br><br>Shane of course was not at all embarrassed. "Looks like more work for the study group." He grinned that grin. "It depends. Have you ever spent all day wandering around naked amongst clothed workers?"<br><br>She shook her head. "Not much of an opportunity for it here."<br><br>Shane raised his eyebrows. "Well, there is one way to find out." They both smiled, probably for different reasons. The door swung open and Shane looked to the entrance. A middle aged man wearing dark glasses and carrying a large black bag was standing there. Shane nodded to the waitress who saw the man at the door too because that was her job. She went over and directed him to Shane.<br><br>The reporter kept his sunglasses on as the two men introduced themselves to each other. "Are you trying to attract attention to yourself?" Shane asked. The reporter raised one eyebrow above the glasses. "The sunglasses," Shane explained. Then checked himself. "You're not blind?" he asked.<br><br>"Oh, forgot I had them on." He removed them, revealing piercing blue eyes. He stared hard at Shane and got straight to the point. "I was hoping we had an arrangement."<br><br>"You're the press Johnny," Shane replied, "so we'll never let you into the building." He shrugged. "No journos inside," although he knew that was not the case.<br><br>The reporter Johnny O'Keefe shook his head. "You know that's not the case. We've all seen the trailers. Whatever's going to air on Tuesday night. That could have been us, trustworthy quality content. We're the ABC."<br><br>Shane explained to him that they had only let the crew in because of all the stringent conditions they had agreed to, what with the chances of others going in with hidden cameras secreted on their person or even just the chance for them to report outside the agreement on what they may or may not have seen. Privacy laws be damned. "We had total control over this one," Shane explained. "I would guess that sort of thing is not what your show would call journalism."<br><br>The waitress came back with their coffees. "I'm Monika," she told Johnny as she extravagantly placed his coffee in front of him, with a little thrust of breast thrown in. Shane looked at her curiously but she affected not to notice. Johnny looked determined, with those steel blue eyes of his. Monika lingered. "Can you make me a mailgirl?" she asked him.<br><br>For once, the reporter looked flustered. "No, I think you've got the wrong person. You should be asking him." He gestured at Shane.<br><br>"I already have," she complained. Shane affected not to look at Monika, so she started to move away.<br><br>"Are you going to tell me anything about your mailgirl program?" Johnny asked Shane.<br><br>Shane tried the charm. "What mailgirl program?" he asked. Monika's ears pricked up. She wasn't that far away from them and she stopped where she was.<br><br>Johnny sighed. "The one that your ultimate boss Mr Harada said publicly that you are running?" he tried.<br><br>Monika stepped back towards the two men, assessed the situation and grabbed a free chair from another table and sat down between them. "Yes, that program," she added staring at Shane, "the one you told me about."<br><br>Shane tried to ignore her and looked at Johnny. "Have you tried talking to him? If he knows all about it? Just phone him in Japan."<br><br>Johnny looked at Monika, trying to work out what sort of support she was giving him. "We tried," he told Shane. "His office says that there is nothing more to say about it than what he has already said in public."<br><br>Shane screwed up his face. "That doesn't sound like him. Usually you can't stop him talking about mailgirls." He laughed, to try to finish the topic.<br><br>"So I need to contact this Mr Harada?" Monika asked.<br><br>Shane looked horrified at her. "I wouldn't do that. You won't know where you might end up. By the way aren't you supposed to be working?"<br><br>Monika smiled at him as she looked around the cafe. "All under control. And are you supposed to be having clandestine meetings outside the office so no one knows?"<br><br>Johnny smiled. "She makes a good point." He looked to Monika. "Maybe you should leverage it." Then he looked back to Shane as he pulled a laptop out of his bag. "There's something I'd like you to look at." Shane sensed the ground was moving, to judge by Johnny's body language. He had a video cued up on the laptop.<br><br>In a grainy video a woman was kneeling naked on the floor of a cafeteria in the most common mailgirl pose. She had what must have been a phone strapped to her arm. To the edge of the image, people were standing around and to judge from the soundtrack they were supporting her protest. Suddenly the camera pulled back revealing another two women undressing and also strapping their phones to their arms. The three women led a chant which sounded like "The clothes stay on!" The video ended.<br><br>Johnny sat back and crossed his arms, holding strong eye contact with Shane. "Are they your mailgirls?" he probed.<br><br>Shane reclined back seemingly unaffected by the interrogation. "The footage is rather low quality. I can tell you that it is not our lunchroom. I can't say for sure that I have ever seen these woman before," he said. "Maybe they're actors?" What he did not say was that he recognised Mitch's daughter Emily as the instigator. But he relied on his casual demeanour, his easy going image to gloss over that, assuming any interest he showed was all about him ogling some girls naked in public in the short video. He looked back at the reporter. It seemed to have worked.<br><br>Then Monika grabbed the laptop. "Let me have a look," she insisted. Shane looked worried as Johnny agreed. What if Monika knew Emily? What were the odds? She ran the video again, concentrating on it while the men watched her. She nodded. "I know that place. It's the University of Melbourne cafeteria."<br><br>"Are you sure?" Shane reflexively asked. Johnny looked intent.<br><br>Monika snorted. "I studied there for a year," she huffed. Then noticed Shane was looking to pooh-pooh her statement. "I studied there for a year," she repeated to Johnny then turned to Shane. "Bachelor of Waitressing," she snorted.<br><br>Johnny sunk his coffee. "You've both been very helpful," he sniffed as he packed up his laptop and left. He glared at Shane on his way out. "You haven't," he added.<br><br>"That was sudden," Monika noted, looking at the empty chair Johnny had so quickly vacated. She thought for a moment. "Where did he get that footage?"<br><br>Shane looked towards the entrance of the cafe, but Johnny was already gone. "Good question," he agreed. "I should have asked him." He looked back to Monika. "Still mailgirl curious?" he asked.<br><br>Monika looked back at Shane across the table. "How do they do it?" she asked.<br><br>He knew what she meant. "Easy. They come in in the morning, take their clothes off and sort of go with the flow."<br><br>"Sounds like a hoot," she smiled. "Any chance?"<br><br>Shane sighed. "You've got to be sure. It's a severe career choice. Think of what you'll be doing and the attitudes towards it here. You have to think of your future," he added probably a bit too desperately. He could not believe that he had actually said that.<br><br>The cliché seemed to steel Monika. She waved her hand around the room to make her point. She leant forward fixed him with her large strong dark eyes. "And I'm thinking of my future here?"<br><br>Shane looked for some middle ground. "What were you studying there?" he asked.<br><br>Monika put a hand flat on the table but Shane ignored it. "Architecture. But I needed some money to you know, eat and stuff, so I deferred after first year."<br><br>So now Shane was in a quandary. Monika actually was thinking about her future.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson wandered through the IT section carrying her laptop to Mitch's office. She usually chose to avoid eye contact with the crowd in there having sensed that keeping aloof from them was good strategy. Although it was not yet clear to her for what. But out of the corner of her eye she saw someone beckoning her over. Ah well, she decided. Since she was not doing a mailgirl message delivery, no hurry. But for some reason, having stepped off her direct path to Mitch's office and in amongst the IT workers, she felt more naked than usual as she pressed through the closely positioned desks. She felt eyes peeking at her from close range, pretending not to be looking, as she squeezed between the desks towards the one person who was staring at her, Simon O'Donnell, who had called her over.<br><br>"Simon," she started when she was close enough. She pressed the laptop to her breasts not coyly, she was sure, but because that was the most comfortable place to hold it as she stood facing the programmer. Anyway, her pussy was very much on display to Simon who was trying to look at the laptop and her face. "Do you want something?" she asked a little brusquely since she did have an appointment. He seemed subdued but also somewhat eager.<br><br>"Sorry," he flustered back, "I was wondering..." he started. Jackson stared at him, not helping. "Fanny," he blurted, "what can you tell me?"<br><br>Jackson smiled, his intention was so obvious, Fanny had beguiled him intentionally or otherwise. Fanny of the large firm breasts which no doubt he had yet to touch, so close and so openly on display throughout the office. And so memorable. Jackson had felt those breasts, massaged them, learning how sensitive to her touch they were. And Jackson had seen Fanny show poor Simon just that little amount extra of attention, attention which had evidently given him hope. Jackson apologised that she was busy but she would talk to him when she was finished. Simon thanked her as she turned and strode away to make her call.<br><br>The call was to her ex-colleague Heather McKay who was now at Harada Industries in the States. It was their regular catch-up. Of course Jackson told Heather about Simon straight away when she got through to her in her apartment in the States, Jackson alone in Mitch's office. "Does she know?" Heather immediately chortled.<br><br>Jackson thought about Fanny's recent behaviour around her. "I'm pretty sure that she does," she answered as she realised that indeed was the case.<br><br>"Great goss! Keep me informed!" was Heather's response.<br><br>"So, it's set for Tuesday," Jackson revealed, the date of the broadcast.<br><br>Heather smiled. "Welcome to the twenty-first century. You'll be just like us once that cat is out of the bag."<br><br>Jackson pulled a face. "Just like us? Don't forget you're one of us. You are just visiting there."<br><br>"Well, let me tell you about that," Heather smiled. But she stopped and turned around as the statuesque American mailgirl Chrissy loudly strode in and up to the screen to give her fellow mailgirl a passionate kiss. "Chrissy is not going to want to hear this," Heather resumed, "but I'm still the most popular mailgirl here. They're not going to let me go anytime soon."<br><br>Jackson shook her head. Heather, short and stocky, was almost the opposite of the tall, thin, long blonde haired American mailgirls like Chrissy that Harada's American operation were known for. Maybe it had something to do with personality after all? Heather smiled slyly into the screen in front of her and then turned to Chrissy and gave her a knowing look. Jackson took a moment to work out why. Another figure was in the room with Heather, moving around in the background. "Okay," Jackson asked, "who else have you got there?"<br><br>Heather grinned widely. "We've got a new one. This one is called Jeneva." She beckoned the newcomer forward. Jackson could see that she was tall slim hipped with pronounced breasts. A typical American mailgirl. Except she had long straight jet-black hair rather than the almost compulsory blonde. But she also had the requisite high cheekbones and large friendly eyes.<br><br>"It's an honour," she told Jackson formally. She looked a little bashful in displaying herself despite the obvious fact that everyone in the conversation — both in the States and in Australia — was as naked as she was.<br><br>Jackson broke out in laughter. "An honour?" she smiled.<br><br>"Yes ma'am," the American replied straight-faced and slightly bemused.<br><br>Heather hugged Jeneva, held her tight around the waist and gave her a kiss on the cheek as she grinned back at Jackson. "Isn't she just a delight!" she exclaimed.<br><br>Jackson just looked confused. "What does Chrissy think of this?" she wondered.<br><br>Chrissy was close enough. She tipped their laptop so that Jackson could see her as well as the other two. "We're mentoring Jeneva. She's learning how to be the best mailgirl from us!" So much positivity. Heather sat Jeneva down next to her and did not try to keep her hands off the novice mailgirl. Chrissy reached down from behind Jeneva to massage her shoulders as Heather played with the novice lower down than that. "She's a quick learner, this one," Chrissy added as she bent down to give Jeneva a kiss on the cheek.<br><br>Heather butted back in. "Yep, I'm a teacher now!" She grinned at Chrissy. "On top of everything else!"<br><br>Jackson decided to take control. Fanny had wanted to be in on the call and had given Jackson some pointers, as she was not sure whether she could get there in time. "Have you had your demerit thing yet?" she asked Heather.<br><br>Heather chuckled. "Nah, not even close. I'm gunning it," she boasted.<br><br>Jackson looked down at the notes that Fanny had given her. "Chrissy," she asked, "what do you know about your employment contract?"<br><br>Chrissy thought for a moment. "Well, they paid off my loans. And there's the health insurance."<br><br>"And did you have to give up anything in return?" Jackson asked. Chrissy looked confused. "Like, say deductions from your pay, minimum term working there?" Jackson tried.<br><br>"Well I did sign on for five years."<br><br>"And what happens if you want to leave before then?"<br><br>"Oh, I'll stay. I'm not worried about that."<br><br>Jackson remembered that she was only seeking information. Despite her instincts as a former — and maybe again future — union rep to give Chrissy employment rights advice, she followed Fanny's directions and controlled herself, did not present her workers rights spiel. "Holidays?" she asked.<br><br>Chrissy shrugged. "I don't know. I'll have to check. But every day is like a holiday here!" She looked down to Jeneva who seemed to be in agreement.<br><br>Heather decided that she had heard enough of that sort of things. "Get this. Jeneva wants to be a mailgirl with you," she told Jackson.<br><br>Jeneva's large eyes seemed to get bigger. "I want to see your kangaroos," she bubbled.<br><br>"You could just go to a zoo," Jackson deadpanned.<br><br>That did not faze the American. "I want to see the real ones," she explained.<br><br>Jackson grunted. She was chewing on the answers that she got from Chrissie. And other implications. She was worried. If the American office sent Jeneva over, say as some sort of deferred swap with Heather, would that mean they could employ mailgirls in Melbourne on American conditions? Say by recruiting them in the States and flying them in? And she worried it was not just about the Australian's special incentive points in danger of becoming demerits and punishments. It was their pay, the time off that she had negotiated, their treatment generally. And the whole edifice of what it meant to be a worker, a mailgirl with rights, in Australia. Real kangaroos, indeed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay Davenport was finding it hard to concentrate on her work, running the office. Too much was bothering her, getting in the way. She sensed that her predecessor Mitch was in his secluded office doing whatever he liked, the mailgirls were just downright rude to her, Shane was no help, and no one had thought to ask her to watch the show with them. Even her hair was rebelling against her as she flicked it angrily out of her eyes. Here she was, the one who had made the segment happen, yet she would be stuck in her apartment alone while the rest of the office made a party of it.<br><br>Realising she was not going to get anything done until she settled her mind she strode out of her office. She must have looked a scene, dishevelled. Because for once the PA Betty Cuthbert actually stopped her work to look up at her boss. "Why are all the mailgirls constantly getting off and I'm not?" Lindsay complained to her.<br><br>Betty kept a straight face. "Sorry, you're asking the wrong person," she responded in the most neutral PA manner possible.<br><br>Damn, Lindsay berated herself, she had not meant to vent like that to Betty, who stood aloof from things, the only person in the office who was not going to watch the show. Still disorientated, she knocked on Shane's office door and entered. The tall mailgirl, the one who reminded Lindsay of a thoroughbred racehorse, was standing close to Shane by the side of his desk. He nodded at Lindsay then looked up to the gleaming, athletic Jan Stephenson. "Can you see if you can get those numbers from HR?" he asked her, seemingly finishing off the instructions he had started before Lindsay had entered.<br><br>"Sure," Jan smiled as she slunk past Lindsay, "I'll bring them back when they're ready." She smirked at Shane. "If you're free, that is," she added, as sardonic as she could be. And out she went.<br><br>With the mailgirl gone, Lindsay let out a groan. "The attitude! It's like the office exists for the benefit of the mailgirls not the other way around," she complained to Shane.<br><br>Shane smiled, a little distant. "Seems like it." He looked at Lindsay wondering where she was heading with the conversation.<br><br>Lindsay put on her management airs. "Well, we're going to change that."<br><br>Shane looked hard at his boss. "Good luck," he offered.<br><br>Lindsay sat down in the chair facing Shane with another sigh. "How big is this city?" she groaned.<br><br>"You haven't found anyone?" Shane diagnosed. She perked up. Was he going to invite her? Shane looked invitingly at her. "If you were hoping to get off in the office. I can help you with that," he suggested.<br><br>Lindsay gave him what she hoped was a polite, disarming look. "I'll take a raincheck," she muttered, hoping to cloak her disappointment.<br><br>But Shane was now on a mission. "Have you thought of bedding Stuart Broad. He's one of you, you must have things in common."<br><br>Lindsay shook her head trying to regain her normality. "He's got a wife." And anyway he was not her type, countryman or not. Definitely not!<br><br>Shane seemed confused by that excuse. "So?" he asked.<br><br>Lindsay sighed again, this time at having to explain. "He's one of those guys who believes marriage is sacred and sex should only be between a loving couple in holy matrimony, et cetera. But yes, the family is still making their arrangements to come out."<br><br>Shane picked up on that. "That explains..."<br><br>"Yes, why he is so uptight," Lindsay completed for him.<br><br>Shane grinned. "The mailgirls better not find that out. They'll make his life Hell. More Hell. One wonders why he chooses to work for us."<br><br>Lindsay gave a hint that she agreed with Shane. "Hmm. By the way, Stuart has been complaining to me. He doesn't seem to be making many friends with you easy-going friendly Aussies."<br><br>Shane pretended to look shocked. "I can't imagine why," he started. "Does he make friends anywhere?" He let that hang for a moment and then pretended to remember. "Although I did go out to lunch with him." Lindsay looked interested. "We talked. Blokes' stuff," he deflected. Then Shane changed his tone, having just apparently now recalled something important. "BTW, do we have the budget to have another mailgirl?" Lindsay looked oddly at Shane, like where did that suddenly come from. Shane smiled as he explained. "Stuart met a girl and he's going to try to recruit her."<br><br>Lindsay just shook her head. Was it always going to be like this? She strode back to her own office. Jackson was sitting, her back to the entrance, one leg draped over the arm of her chair. Lindsay looked closely. Was she playing with herself?<br><br>"Did I call a mailgirl?" she sniffed, still behind Jackson who stopped whatever she was doing, her hands went to her sides. Although she kept her legs open.<br><br>Turning to Lindsay, she smiled. "Thought you might be about to," she suggested. "So I could get some of those no longer available incentive points."<br><br>"God, if only there was somewhere I could send you," Lindsay bit back as she sat down facing Jackson. "Is there anything I can do for you?" she continued, wondering that she was supposed to be running the office.<br><br>"I've got the rest of the mailgirls coming around to mine," Jackson offered as she twirled a lock of hair with a provocative finger. "Would you like to come over too?"<br><br>This was too much for Lindsay. "No, I have my own arrangements," she shot back automatically. Jackson did not seem ready to move yet. "Is there anything else?" Lindsay added.<br><br>Jackson let go of the tress. "I was thinking," she started as she ran that free hand down her side towards her still exposed crotch. She stopped. "Nah, it doesn't matter," she decided and got up to leave.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>After dinner Mitch was alone with Jessica in the games room. "The girls are out again," he noted.<br><br>On the lounge, his wife toyed with the TV remote. "They have friends," she replied drily as she turned on the television. "It's almost time. What channel is this show on?" Jessica wondered out loud as the picture came up. She found the channel, with the show about to start. "What are you expecting?" Jessica asked Mitch as she stood up, patted down her skirt and circled him.<br><br>"I'm out of that loop," Mitch admitted. "Shane of course boasted to me that he did the greatest interview ever. So I can only imagine how much of that makes the cut."<br><br>Jessica looked more closely at Mitch, who was naked, kneeling with his knees apart, shoulders back. "I'm sure there are more positions," she commented as she leant down enough to stroke his cock a few times, to make sure that he was fully hard. She nodded, happy at her work on that. "Stay that way," she ordered. Then she smiled at her husband as she sat back down on the couch. "I must study those videos to find them so I can teach you. Now hush. You're a mailboy about to watch your mailgirls. And then maybe afterwards..."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The Melbourne Harada office stood empty. No humans, clothed or otherwise, strode through the corridors, made coffee, worked at their computers, talked to colleagues or summoned mailgirls. From the viewing window on the sixth floor, the benches on the mezzanine were just visible in the dimness of the few emergency lights that flickered on the various floors including the one where the mailgirls hung out between messages.<br><br>Suddenly the fire door on the mezzanine swung open. A figure partly illuminated by their phone stepped in the hangout area, concentrating on their phone and whoever was on the line. It seemed that they were face timing with the other party.<br><br>"You know what you have to do!" the Japanese voice on the phone barked.<br><br>"Yes, sir," came the hesitant answer.<br><br>"Now show me!" the man ordered. There was a movement towards the benches as the woman obeyed. First the jacket came off, placed carefully on the bench. Then the rest was shrugged off as efficiently as possible given the woman was holding her phone in one hand. She was naked, moving the phone up and down her body so that her contact could see that she had obeyed him.<br><br>"Now," he ordered, "go up the stairs!"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>As soon as she arrived, Annette made no secret that she was checking Jackson's flat out. She strode straight inside, through to the kitchen, then down the hall to the bedrooms and back to the living room where most of the other mailgirls from the office were sipping drinks and getting used to being around each other with clothes on.<br><br>"Fantastic," Annette blurted, "so modern!" And it was close to the office but not too close. Were there any others in the complex available? Under this barrage of questions, Jackson considered what she did not know about the other mailgirls' private lives. Where did Annette live? Who did she live with? Did she have a partner? Jackson thought that she did but now was not sure. There were questions that she should ask. But for the moment there was so much for her to do as host. She went back to the kitchen.<br><br>Jan looked around the group who were variously arranged in Jackson's living room. Kimiko sat at the end of her couch, typically she seemed to be observing the others, not contributing. Most of the rest were standing. Lauryn plonked down on the large sofa next to Jan who took stock, noting Annette's arrival. "Only Fanny to arrive now. So let's keep any revelations until we're all here!"<br><br>"What revelations are there?" Pam asked looking worried. She read Jan's smirk wrongly and started. "Should I be worried?" she asked hurriedly.<br><br>"Your secrets are safe with us," Annette suggested slyly as Jackson came back into the room with a glass of wine for her.<br><br>Jackson picked up on Pam's discomfort and noticed her almost empty glass. "I'll get you another truth serum," she decided, snatching the wineglass from Pam's hand.<br><br>Annette looked over to Lauryn. "You've been quiet," she noted.<br><br>Lauryn tried to make sure her smile was agreeable. "Just getting used to being around you lot with all our clothes on again."<br><br>Pam looked surprised. "Again?"<br><br>It took a moment for Annette to realise. "You didn't know?" It seemed that Pam did not know. "We all worked at Harada with our clothes on. Heather too. Before," she explained. "Well except for Jackson and Fanny."<br><br>"But then some of us knew them when they had their clothes on too," Kimiko added softly as Pam processed that news. The doorbell rang and Jackson went out to answer it to Fanny carrying Pam's glass.<br><br>"Thanks," Fanny smiled reaching for the glass.<br><br>"It's not for you," Jackson warned, leading her into the living room and delivering it to Pam.<br><br>"That's so weird," Pam exploded.<br><br>"What's weird?" Fanny asked as she acknowledged everyone in the room. She looked over at the television. "You have the right channel on?"<br><br>"You all knew each other with your clothes on. I'm the only one that you only know as a mailgirl only." Pam looked a little worried at the thought.<br><br>Lauryn spoke up. "Well, we didn't know each other. I mean as well as we do now."<br><br>"I used to watch you go into those meetings and wondered what you would look like under those business suits," Annette smiled at her.<br><br>"You didn't!" Lauryn gasped.<br><br>Annette laughed. "No, I didn't. But you were always so serious."<br><br>Pam looked over to Jackson and Fanny. "And you two?"<br><br>Jan butted in. "Jackson was brought in to negotiate our contracts and then..." She tailed off for a moment. "How did it happen, Jackson?"<br><br>Jackson laughed. "That's a long story for another time. The short version is that Mitch kind of dared me to." That got laughter from them all. Even Kimiko smiled.<br><br>"And I was already studying mailgirls. I had already done some research here, and they gave me the only chance in Australia for some hands-on experience," Fanny smiled.<br><br>"Hands-on!" Annette chortled.<br><br>"So I'm the sort of only outsider," Pam realised. "Does that make me a... I don't know..."<br><br>"A secret agent," Jan suggested. "We had wondered."<br><br>Pam looked confused. "But who would I be reporting on you to?"<br><br>Annette gave her a look. "You're on the front of magazine covers, you're in the media. I'm guessing that you know people who would be interested."<br><br>Pam tried to laugh that off. "But only as a pretty face!" she attempted.<br><br>"Typical double bluff," Kimiko murmured loudly enough for all to hear.<br><br>"Really?!" Pam reacted.<br><br>"Well nothing you could possibly do would be as significant as what is about to go on the tele," Lauryn concluded. And to punctuate that, a commanding male voice came up in the ad break. "Coming up next, we go behind the doors of Harada Industries, an office outwardly like any other in the heart of Melbourne. Like any other except for one thing," he added portentously. And the one word in bold caps smashed across the screen. MAILGIRLS.<br><br>They were all silent for a moment. Then Annette squeaked up. "That's us," she stated. And the ice broke somewhat. It would not be long now.<br><br>Lauryn groaned at the start. Rosemary was addressing the camera out the front about her descent into the den of iniquity, plenty of cliched sensationalised build-up. "This is so exploitative," Lauryn complained.<br><br>"What did you expect?" Jan countered with a sigh. "I'm sure it will get worse."<br><br>There was a quick blurred shot of a mailgirl rushing through the office before the start of the interview with Lindsay. "Who was that?" Annette asked.<br><br>"Could have been any of us. Too quick and out of focus for anything definite," Fanny suggested.<br><br>"What's she talking about?" Annette butted in. Since Fanny was talking over Lindsay's interview.<br><br>"She's trying to explain the noble origins of the mailgirl," Lauryn suggested drily, leaning close in to the TV screen. As Lindsay had expected when she had helped to set the scene up, the camera had stayed tight on her as she talked, pulling back a little to show the backs of the heads of the two kneeling mailgirls who flanked her. A slight view of their shoulders suggested to the viewer that they had nothing on below.<br><br>"Steeped in the ancient Japanese tradition," Kimiko commented just as dry as Lauryn. Kimiko realised that some were looking agog at her for that criticism. "I can say that," she insisted. Jackson grabbed the remote control, remembered to put on the subtitles. The first line came up 'Japanese tradition.' "See," Kimiko added, "a proud export." The next hastily transcribed subtitle referred to 'Here at Hahaha Industries.' That got a laugh too.<br><br>Annette and Jan were in the shot as the camera again pulled carefully back from Lindsay. "Come on, let's have some sideboob girls!" Fanny demanded as only the back of their heads, one bare shoulder and a bit of their backs were in shot.<br><br>Annette playfully punched Jan in the arm. "We should have thought of that," she laughed.<br><br>"We were too busy concentrating on what Lindsay was saying," Jan laughed back.<br><br>"No, we weren't," Annette started to complain before she realised the joke.<br><br>As Lindsay kept expounding, the vision cut to a general shot of one of the open plan floors of the office. Workers sat at their desks doing their work thing as Lindsay talks about mailgirls inspiring the workplace. At which point a mailgirl sails past the camera quickly. Only her back and legs are on view. And of course her butt.<br><br>"Nice arse Pam!" Annette sang out.<br><br>"Are you sure?" Jan asked her, giving her own backside an examination suggesting such an impressive asset may not belong to Pam but to her.<br><br>Pam was in no doubt. "Oh my god, I didn't realise they were filming. You don't see my face. Do you?" She looked over to Jan. "The hair's a giveaway," she told the other woman. Which was true. Her hair was much longer than Jan's. Pam was right. It was her bottom in the shot.<br><br>Lauryn decided to get into the swing of things. "We'll check frame by frame when it goes up on replay," she suggested.<br><br>Rosemary, the journalist, came back on screen, standing in what looked like a production room, in front of a mixing desk. "After the break," she told the viewer, "we'll get a man's view on the mailgirl phenomenon."<br><br>"Shane," Jan, Annette, and Fanny all screeched as the ad break started, the vision on the television ironically changing to some well dressed young women in an office tormenting some fresh faced men in the interests of either a bank, insurance company or superannuation fund.<br><br>The segment after the ad break started with what the producer must have thought was the most provocative thing Shane had said to Rosemary. "Admiring the female body is not exploitative," he smiled to the camera. Being Shane, it would be easy to agree with him on that, his charm, if he said it to your face. Except in an interview, it gave off a bit of a whiff. In Jackson's living room, they got that sense straight away.<br><br>Jan started. "Well, he'd know!"<br><br>Jackson stared at her. "Jan!" she exclaimed. Did Jan mean what Jackson thought she meant?<br><br>Annette picked up on Jan's commentary. "The way he's looking at her, you can tell he's thinking what she would look like naked with that big schlong up her."<br><br>This time it was Jan. "Annette!" she shrieked.<br><br>Annette looked over to Jan. "Come on, we've all been there, right?" she responded. For some reason she looked over to Jackson, still shocked from Jan's original outburst.<br><br>Jackson stared at Annette, speechless for a moment. "What!? I can tell you I haven't. I haven't even thought about it," she spluttered.<br><br>Lauryn shook her head at Jackson. "Well, you're different, what with your platonic 'work husband'..."<br><br>Annette chuckled. "Although you've stretched the meaning of 'platonic' to breaking point. Some of us choose to see to our needs."<br><br>Jackson's jaw literally dropped. "You mean??"<br><br>Annette nodded sagely. "Yep. Come on, you knew."<br><br>Jackson aghast, looked around the room. Jan smiled at her. "What you too?" Jackson asked.<br><br>Jan shrugged. "Well, early days. I was horny and the dildo station just wasn't doing the job. And he paged me. And..."<br><br>"And the boyfriend?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"He kind of accepted that sort of thing might happen with me wandering naked in the office. Plus I make it worth his while." Jan seemed pretty relaxed about her situation.<br><br>Jackson looked around to find that Lauryn was now grinning at her. "Not you too?" Jackson asked her.<br><br>Lauryn shrugged. "We're not nuns, you know. Well most of us."<br><br>They all turned to look at Fanny who smirked back. "Purely research purposes," she stated, arms crossed like that was so obvious she did not need to really say it.<br><br>Annette smirked at Fanny. "Well you kept that quiet." She looked over to the next candidate. "Kimiko?" she probed.<br><br>Kimiko nodded impassionately. "Well yes," she revealed. "The way that you were all carrying on, I thought I better find out what the fuss was about." Of course, she had been quietly observing.<br><br>Jackson, still incredulous blurted "And?"<br><br>Kimiko looked like she was in deep thought. "It's big all right. But I've known smaller men who know how to use theirs better. But when its available and you need it, well, he's good enough for that."<br><br>So, wondered Jackson, was it that easy to fuck someone new. Why did she find it so difficult?<br><br>But the girls still had one more candidate. Annette looked over at her. "That leaves you Pam. Come on, spill it," she ordered.<br><br>Pam made like she had to think about the right answer for a moment. "You are all going to laugh," she started, stopped and looked around. "I've only given him a headjob so far."<br><br>It was Jan's turn to exclaim. "Don't tell me you were under the desk?"<br><br>Pam screwed up her face. "Come on, you think I would fit under the desk?"<br><br>Annette needed more. "Okay Pam, you're the dark horse, give us the details. I've barely seen you spread your legs. And now we hear you shamelessly sucked him off."<br><br>Pam made a guilty face. "It was totally my fault."<br><br>Jan acted consoling. "Of course it was."<br><br>Pam thanked Jan and continued. "Despite what Annette thinks of me..." Pam's eyes sparkled with a hint of innocence, "well, I was on the tenth floor and felt a need to check out the dildo station. I had the lush up my you-know-what and thought what the hell and gave the big dildo a lick and then I gave it more of a lick and then got carried away, showed it some real attention. In my own world. Being a gentleman, he politely coughed after watching me for who knows how long. I looked at him, keeping the big plastic thing in my mouth and the lush driving me mental downstairs. And what with him watching. So I gave the dildo some serious sucking, and I don't know, I decided I needed something more realistic. Heck, that's just the way I swing. So I took the dildo out of my mouth gave it a nice kiss while I looked Shane in the eye and said 'do you want to put your dick in my mouth?' He seemed okay with that idea." Pam laughed. "Well, one thing led to another which led to Mitch's office which used to be Shane's of course, which led to him on the couch with his dick in my mouth, the lush turned up to max. And everybody was happy!"<br><br>There was silence after Pam's story. Someone on the TV shouted something about making a sports bet. Jackson realised first. "Of course, look, we've missed everything else that Shane said to the reporter," she advised the room.<br><br>Kimiko coughed politely then spoke up. "I was watching and saw her voiceover at the end. 'Is it the future of office work — or the past?' the reporter said." Kimiko was playing right into the role, aping the reporter's intonation as she continued. "Some would see mailgirls as taking women 100 years back in their struggle for equal rights. But others would see it as a way — a strange way, true — for women to assert themselves in the workplace. This is an experiment. And it is too soon to know how it will work out. And cut to the ad break." Kimiko smiled and looked around the room. "So now we all know. We are an experiment that is too soon to know."<br><br>There was some private amusement until Fanny spoke up. "You see," she said.<br><br>Lauryn shook her head at Fanny. "I see more research money coming your way."<br><br>Fanny smiled back at Lauryn like she was right, that was probably going to happen. Jackson spoke up. "Well, that was the sensationalist topic of the day. Done and dusted. People will probably forget mailgirls by tomorrow when they run a story about people who wore their clothes back to front or dogs with five legs or whatever."<br><br>No one really had an answer for that, and the conversation lapsed for the moment. Jackson busied herself around the group filling up their glasses. When she was done, she left the room just as Lauryn spoke up.<br><br>"Well, that was as tacky as you would expect," Lauryn commented.<br><br>"Tacky? Pam asked her.<br><br>Lauryn thought for a moment. "Yeah, I think that describes it."<br><br>"That journo was a bit smug," Annette suggested.<br><br>"Standard operating procedure." Jan stated quite firmly.<br><br>Annette thought about it. "Maybe when you and I were in there with Lindsay, we should have talked to her, explained our point of view. That might have influenced things."<br><br>"You think so?" Lauryn asked her. "I think it would have gone much the same way whether we tried or not. They were after something and they got it. Jackson's right. Now they move on to the next sensation."<br><br>Jackson returned carrying some bowls of nibbles. But they quickly noticed that she had changed. Rather than her streetwear, she was now wearing a long white T-shirt that just covered her bottom. And likely she did not wear much more.<br><br>"What the Heck is that?" Annette demanded.<br><br>Jackson put the bowls down on her coffee table and swung around so that they all could clearly see it. Resembling an American football jersey it had a large number 69 centred. Above the number was the word "Mailgirl." Front and back.<br><br>"Please explain," Jan demanded.<br><br>Jackson smiled, the centre of attention. "It's from Heather. It's what they wear when they go outside on sunny days."<br><br>"Oh yeah, it looks American," Annette noted.<br><br>Lauryn looked concerned. "Do you think they would try to bring that in here?"<br><br>"They'd have to give us numbers first," Fanny decided. "Jackson?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "They still can't do that."<br><br>Annette sidled up to Jackson from behind. Before Jackson realised, she raised the T-shirt with one hand to prove that Jackson was indeed naked under it. With the other hand she reached for Jackson's exposed slit. But Mailgirl 69 backed away from her. "Annette!" she gasped.<br><br>"Later," Annette threatened as she patted the T-shirt back down and shook her head. "With a body like yours, you could walk down St Kilda Road in that and no one would know or care if you had anything on underneath or not."<br><br>Jackson looked at her. "Is that praise?"<br><br>"I'm jealous," Annette conceded.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Having checked that everyone had drinks and refilled the nibbles on the coffee table, Jackson sat down in her armchair. She found that with the TV now turned off, she was facing her guests. Annette and Jan came over and although their were clothed they took on mailgirl poses, kneeling on either side of her. Ignoring that the T-shirt was just barely covering her crotch, Jackson looked around the group. "So does anyone know anything about Mailgirls In The Office?" she asked casually. She looked to each of them and to her surprise, Pam, who had been standing and talking to Fanny, flinched.<br><br>Jackson caught Pam's attention, and slightly surprised to have landed a catch, asked her "what do you know?" The other mailgirls hushed, stared at Pam.<br><br>Pam looked down at her feet. "I was there," she admitted.<br><br>Jackson's eyes widened. "This is a major discovery," she smiled. The others murmured their interest.<br><br>Pam smiled back to Jackson. "Oh goody!" she gushed, like it was going to be fun.<br><br>Jackson gave Pam a stern look. "You're not taking this seriously." She tried to sound like she was serious.<br><br>Pam smirked. "Dressed like that, neither are you."<br><br>Jackson looked down to see that the T-shirt had ridden high above her crotch. She tried to cover up but found that she could not manage that without some major rearrangement. She left it. "Touche," she conceded. "But you have to tell us everything. What was it? What happened?" Jackson pressed her for answers.<br><br>Pam faltered. "It's kind of hard for me to say..." she started.<br><br>"Why, were you in it?" Annette asked. Needless to say, all the mailgirls were fully concentrating on Pam's unfolding admissions.<br><br>"Um, in a way," Pam continued. "My boyfriend forced me on stage. He thinks I'm a mailgirl." She looked around for support.<br><br>"Well, you are?" Jan pointed out.<br><br>Lauryn realised. "Wait, you haven't told him?"<br><br>"Well, we've only just started going out. I was going to break it to him slowly, say over about two or three years. If we're still together... Why have you told yours?" Pam looked to the rest of them.<br><br>"Um, it did seem like the right thing to do," Jan argued.<br><br>Pam looked back to Jackson for her support. "But I thought it would be a breach of contract, affect the integrity of the program, et cetera. Aren't we supposed to be discreet and that sort of thing? Concerned for the company image about things getting out?"<br><br>Lauryn spoke up. "Um Pam, we don't give a shit."<br><br>Pam tried to avoid Lauryn and looked to Jackson. "Well I do," she retaliated. "I'm trying to do this properly."<br><br>But Lauryn continued. "Yeah, but you are probably going back to the outside when your contract runs out. We're pretty much untouchable. It would be pretty hard for the company to get rid of the rest of us. Except for you, Fanny, but you're the same as Jackson. And you both have things to go to outside too. And anyway, Lindsay keeps threatening that this is only the first step, so we have to get used to it. Except, well, thanks to Jackson's contracts we have some say in this if we want to push it."<br><br>Kimiko did her usual thing, coughed politely for attention. "I think we're missing the big picture with this speculation. And it's only speculation. I know what I actually want to hear. Pam, tell us everything about Mailgirls In The Office."<br><br>Annette leapt on that. "Yeah, when can we see you perform it again?"<br><br>Pam shook her head. "It was one night only, I'm afraid. And I think I messed that up." The others looked to her for an explanation. "Well, I had to go up on the stage. In my clothes. And I'll break the bad news to you all now. I stayed in them for the whole performance. So no, I didn't play a mailgirl. Rather, I was the Greek chorus." The rest nodded at that, those who knew what a Greek chorus was, and those who didn't. "Oh, the cast. I'm pretty sure the director was the mailgirl actor's sister, that's my guess, or someone pretty close to her. I was sitting with The Boss. And there were two other actors on the stage, a man and a woman. They ordered the mailgirl across the stage to deliver messages to each other. While The Boss and I discussed modern control management in the workplace."<br><br>"Sounds like a thrill," Lauryn noted.<br><br>Pam shrugged. "I don't know, something for everybody. A naked mailgirl going backwards and forwards on the stage. While I argued with The Boss about the ethics of what was going on, the gender politics of it and the challenge it made to patriarchal structures. So there was something for the more serious viewer as well as the voyeur. And then at the end the other worker decided to become a mailgirl too and took her clothes off."<br><br>Fanny was of course interested. "And who were the creators?"<br><br>Pam shrugged. "You'll find it strange, but I don't remember their names. It was the characters I was addressing." She thought for a moment. "I think there was a program. If I didn't keep mine, I'll bet Ian kept his. He's like that." Fanny thanked Pam, and Jackson took note that Mailgirls In The Office people were traceable. Although she was not sure whether it would matter or not. She looked down and tried to pull the T-shirt down to cover herself. Failed again, her crotch still showing.<br><br>Annette noticed. "I want one of those." Jackson stood up and nodded privately to her. Without making a fuss they left the room.<br><br>"So what did you and The Boss argue about?" Fanny asked Pam.<br><br>Pam smiled. "He got my back up. The performance assumed that all mailgirls are like we see in the videos from the States and Japan, all female submission and male gaze. I don't think they had conceptualised that it could be any different. Or that there could be female bosses. So I kind of pushed against that."<br><br>The others watched Pam then Fanny, who was digesting what Pam had just pointed out. "You're right," exclaimed Fanny, "I hadn't realised until now. But there are no female bosses in any of the 'official' mailgirl videos."<br><br>"And yet our office boss, interviewed on the show is a woman," Jan realised."<br><br>"But I reckon the viewer will take more notice of what Shane said, being a man and being Shane and all," Lauryn retorted.<br><br>Fanny nodded. "You're probably right."<br><br>And at that moment, Jackson and Annette reappeared, Annette was now according to the T-shirt she wore Mailgirl 99. "What do you think?" she smiled as she spun around for full effect, the garment rising above her backside and showing her off in the front above the thighs too.<br><br>Lauryn shook her head at the way the material bunched up above Annette's hips. "I'll bet it's designed to do that," she commented with her trademark barbed tone.<br><br>Jackson looked down to see that the act of walking had done the same to her even though unlike Annette, she barely had hips. She shrugged and smiled. "Who wants to be Mailgirl 13?"<br><br>Jackson organised another round of drinks, bending from the waist as she served the other mailgirls. Kimiko shook her head as Jackson approached her. "I think I would like to go now, if that's okay," Kimiko asked her quietly.<br><br>Jackson smiled back. "Our contract says you can leave any time you want."<br><br>Kimiko took that more seriously than Jackson intended. "Thank you," she replied solemnly and got up for Jackson to escort her to the door.<br><br>Annette having become the centre of the party grinned after Kimiko had left. "Strange one that one, even after all this time I still don't get her." They were all lounging around on Jackson's couches, Annette between Lauryn and Pam, facing the other three across the coffee table. For a moment no one chose not to comment on their colleague.<br><br>"I wonder," Lauryn started after a moment, "whether what she gets up to makes what are doing feel more normal."<br><br>"A mailgirls Overton window," offered Fanny.<br><br>"Whatever that is," Annette laughed as she lifted her Mailgirl 99 T-shirt up over her head, completely baring herself, then stretching out her arms and spreading her legs. "That feels better," she gushed, suggesting that maybe she did indeed know what it was.<br><br>The others pretended to ignore Annette who was attempting to make seductive eye contact with any of them. Jan turned to Jackson. "Sorry, I've got to ask, since we don't get around to it at work. You live alone here? No bloke?"<br><br>Jackson looked to Lauryn for support since she knew. Lauryn nodded back. So Jackson admitted to the rest that she hasn't been dating since she got rid of her boyfriend Martin, right at the start of her mailgirl adventure. "It was kind of amicable. I don't miss him. But every so often I could do with a real dick." She bunched her T-shirt up near her crotch as if she was stimulating herself. Maybe she was.<br><br>Annette saw an opportunity, staring hard at Jackson as she toyed with her own pussy. "A real dick? There's always Shane," she suggested with a big grin.<br><br>Jackson emphatically took her hands off her crotch. "No thanks, not that one," she shot back.<br><br>Fanny joined in with the obvious. "She's saving herself for Mitch," she reminded Annette.<br><br>Pam looked to Fanny, confused. "Is that true?" Clearly she wasn't in on the joke. The others all grinned. Except for Jackson who gave Fanny a dirty look.<br><br>Lauryn again filled the dead air. "You could do worse than Shane, Jackson," she concluded dryly. She looked around at the others acknowledging what they all knew that all of them but Jackson had shared.<br><br>After a moment, Jackson noticed a look of worry on Pam's face. "What is it Pam?" she asked.<br><br>Pam coughed politely, then looked down at the carpet, a worried look on her face. Eventually, she spoke. "Are we good?" she asked in a small voice.<br><br>"Except for Mailgirls In The Office," Fanny suggested.<br><br>"And only sucking off Shane," Jan pointed out.<br><br>"And the spying," Annette added with a grin, reaching over and giving Pam a big hug, her bare breasts pressed hard against the former model. "Of course you're good," Annette gushed, kissing Pam warmly on the cheek. "We're all in this together. And you can hardly call any of us saints." She gave Jackson a challenge of a look. "Even that one," she added, keeping both eyes in contact with Jackson's. Jackson shook her head in mock defeat as Annette gripped Pam tighter. The room buzzed. One of them was naked and another was close enough. And all this talk about sex. What next?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Was the Mailgirls segment a sensation? Certainly, the connected parties were watching it, some more enthusiastically than others.<br><br>Wendy Turnbull's husband called out to her from the living room "it's about to start!"<br><br>Wendy had found something to concentrate on in the kitchen, away from the soon to be revelation of what went on in her workplace.<br><br>"You don't want to miss it," he called urgently. "Your turn to shine!"<br><br>Wendy felt that she had better go in and do her duty in response to that. "I'm not going to be in it," she mumbled. But she could see her husband's excitement, so she surrendered to sit on the couch next to him, facing the television.<br><br>In Mitch's games room, Jessica slowly stripped as she stood above her kneeling husband. "We're going to have to work hard to make this sexy at all," he told her.<br><br>"What?" she asked.<br><br>"You don't seriously expect anything truly titillating from commercial TV during prime time?"<br><br>"Mr Harada will not be pleased," Jessica smiled, pushing her crotch into his face so he could lick her.<br><br>"Not my problem," Mitch smiled up at his wife. One thing he enjoyed in his new role was not having to endure Mr Harada's tirades. It was only now that Mitch could stand back and view the office from a distance and realise Mr Harada wanted too much to be done his way and expected his managers to satisfy his whims whatever they were.<br><br>Holly Crawford walked in to their living room. "The kids are in bed," she confirmed to Shane who was waiting for her, holding a bottle of red close to two glasses. "Special occasion?" she teased.<br><br>Shane turned the label so she could admire it.<br><br>"You invited the Johnsons?" Holly checked.<br><br>"Mitch said he was tied up," Shane replied.<br><br>"Sounds like Jessica," Holly smiled.<br><br>On the screen Lindsay answered Rosemary's questions while Holly concentrated her viewing on the mailgirls kneeling beside her. "Who are they?" Holly asked her husband. "Those two look pretty fit."<br><br>"Ah, they're okay," Shane deflected. "Nothing like you," he tried, aiming for a tone of confidence.<br><br>Holly gave Shane a look that suggested she knew her husband better than he thought she did. "Tell me again that you keep that big monster in your pants in the office," she put to him.<br><br>Shane laughed. Holly stared at her husband, trying to read his reaction.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Betty Cuthbert had finished her dinner, put on a Beethoven piano concerto CD and relaxed into her rereading of Sense and Sensibility. She had barely settled into the Dashwood's social goings-on when her phone rang. Betty's first instinct was to ignore it given what the television had presumably just delivered. But she checked the display and it was her mother. She better answer, just in case.<br><br>"Are you all right?" Betty asked, fearing something bad from this rare nocturnal call.<br><br>"I'm fine," the older woman reported although a trifle abrupt.<br><br>"What have you been up to?" Betty asked. Some times she wondered, her mother living alone in Wangaratta and still more than active. What does one do in Wangaratta at night, Betty wondered. Rather her mother did not tell her.<br><br>Her mother got to the point. "Harada Industries, that's where you work," she stated. With some vehemence.<br><br>Betty knew. "That's why I moved to the city, to get away from that," she warned her mother.<br><br>There was only a brief pause on the line. "You're not one of them are you?" came the response.<br><br>Betty smiled, knowing that she could not be seen. "Maybe I'll let you stew wondering," she answered flatly. She imagined how the mailgirls would respond, the assertive group that they were. Probably something like that. She could sense her mother's indignation.<br><br>"If you were younger, I'd come and bring you back home with me."<br><br>Betty's reply channelled any of the mailgirls. "But we both know that's not going to happen."<br><br>"I'll be praying," her mother warned.<br><br>"You do that," Betty concluded. Her mother hung up. And Betty Cuthbert sighed loudly. The mailgirls have it easy, she decided.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily and Cara eased back in their chairs close to the big screen. "Not long to go now," Cara noted as she checked the time on her phone. She looked a bit closer. "Rod said he was just parking," Cara told her sister. She looked again. "Oh that was 15 minutes ago." The Sports Bar was perhaps half full. Either way, there were plenty of chairs and stools available, even close to the two attractive sisters who were similarly dressed in short skirts that showed a lot of leg and blouses that at least Cara had unbuttoned to reveal an expanse of cleavage. They were asking for attention but not getting any.<br><br>"Girls," a loud voice greeted them from behind. They looked around. It was indeed Rod, who had played The Boss in Mailgirls In The Office. He looked at them and looked around. "Not your usual haunt," he noted.<br><br>Emily spoke up. "It's Cara's idea. She wanted to see the public reaction."<br><br>Rod eyed Emily up and down, not subtly at all. "Keeping your clothes on?" he asked.<br><br>Emily looked slyly back at him. "I'm not sure that this is a mailgirl friendly venue. Anyway we're looking for interesting public reactions. It's not about me today."<br><br>Rod snorted, clearly not convinced. "Should I guess what you are wearing underneath?"<br><br>Emily fingered the hem of her dress which had ridden high up her thighs. "Mailgirls travel light," she replied, pushing the hem downwards, but only a little.<br><br>Rod turned his attention to Cara. "What she said," Cara replied dismissively.<br><br>Rod shook his head. "That's not what I was going to ask." He snorted and stared knowingly at Cara. "I believe there was another attempt to smash the patriarchy," he sneered at her making sure she was aware of getting the same visual examination he had made of Emily, "to which I was not invited."<br><br>"You were busy," Cara told Rod firmly, whether that was true or not.<br><br>"Did I miss anything?" he continued in the same tone.<br><br>"Oh nothing," Emily broke in. "Just workshopping some ideas."<br><br>"Which wouldn't have involved a usually clothed person going mailgirl and getting herself spit roasted for the cause?" Rod stated firmly.<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about," Cara shot back, buttoning up her blouse. "Anyways, it is about to start. Let's pay attention." The bar was still only partly full. Cara gestured to the screen in front of their table that had a segment about a renting family with a tap that had been leaking for three years. That segment was winding up. "I think you have time to get us a round of drinks Rod," she ordered.<br><br>Rod returned with their drinks just as the mailgirls segment started. The staff of the bar were clearly into it, they had turned up the volume up so that they could hear every word. It began.<br><br>At the start, the reporter asked her question 'What is going on inside the offices of Harada Industries?' Some wag near the bar called out "Yeah!" A few more punters came in from the main room.<br><br>Emily smiled at her two companions. "That's what we all want to know!" she exploded, excitedly.<br><br>Cara shook her head. "Does anyone really think that we are going to find out?" The others looked at her surprised. "It's on free to air. What do you really think they can show?"<br><br>Rod looked around the room. "You'll be surprised that three-quarters of the people here watching are men. They are hoping to learn something."<br><br>Cara and Emily looked around to confirm that. Emily nudged Cara. "The women here don't seem very enthusiastic," Emily stated. And indeed most of the women they could see appeared to be radiating scorn on their male partners for their mailgirl interest.<br><br>Cara looked around the room. "Tough audience, different to the theatre crowd."<br><br>Rod turned back to the sisters. "I get the sense that a lot of women don't like their men looking at other women when they are naked."<br><br>Emily smiled at him. "It's a reaction to the historical patriarchal hegemony. A generation or two ago we would have had to just sit there and pretend to enjoy it."<br><br>Rod pretended to look aghast. "Hey, that's my line of reasoning. But I can add this. In the modern era, as many women have watched the mailgirls videos from the States as men. Women are into it too. I think I read a study somewhere."<br><br>"Well at least my performance at the Uni isn't on the net," Emily stated.<br><br>"We did make sure that no one would film it," Rod reminded her.<br><br>"Oh, not that one," Emily started. Then seeing Rod's widened eyes, realised that she had made a mistake there.<br><br>Rod said nothing to acknowledge her response though. Although he was concentrating on his phone. He scrolled for a moment, had a look and smiled. He then turned his phone towards Emily. "Is that you?" he asked. The video was low res. But you could clearly enough see a naked woman in a mailgirl pose while a bunch of people around her chanted their support.<br><br>Emily looked at the phone and then gave Cara a knowing glance.<br><br>Rod took the phone back, had a closer look at it. "Don't worry, you've only had 314 views," he noted. "And most of those are in India. You're big in Mumbai."<br><br>"Who said it was me?" Emily asked. Cara tried to keep a straight face.<br><br>Rod gave her a smug look back. "I've seen you naked," he reminded her, "close up."<br><br>Cara looked around the room, happy to see that the broadcast volume was loud enough that they had not been overhead. And the rest of the viewers were concentrating on the big screens, not them, especially during Lindsay's interview with the two mailgirls kneeling on the floor, tantalisingly close to exposure. She was about to tell the other two that they were missing the interview when something on the screen caught her eye. "Shit," she exclaimed.<br><br>Rod and Emily both turned to her with a collective "What?"<br><br>Cara gestured at the screen. "She's gone now, but I bet that was our girl up there a moment ago."<br><br>Emily twigged before Rod and asked "Pam?" Cara nodded.<br><br>Rod smirked. "So the little liar. All the time she was a mailgirl."<br><br>Emily nodded, agreeing. "That makes a lot of sense." She got a look from Cara for that. "She knew a lot about mailgirls, remember?" Emily pointed out.<br><br>Cara nodded back. "But I can't be sure. It was less than a second."<br><br>"Which is why they invented catch-up TV services," Emily suggested.<br><br>"Yes, I'll be studying that."<br><br>The segment finished. The staff quickly changed the channel to a football game and dropped the volume. Rod looked around the emptying room and back at the sisters. "Now that's over, do you two want a lift anywhere?"<br><br>"Where were you thinking?" Cara asked cautiously.<br><br>"How about my place?" Rod brazenly replied. "We have some outstanding business since I missed the second performance," he tried.<br><br>"Maybe there was a reason we didn't invite you?" Cara teased.<br><br>"Cara!" Emily countered. "Rod's just trying to be nice to us." She raised the hem of her short skirt allowing Rod to see all of her thighs.<br><br>Rod stared at Emily's legs for a moment then nodded at Cara. "I'm just trying to be nice," he confirmed as Emily undid a button of her blouse, baring some new flesh.<br><br>Cara crossed her arms, watching her sister's performance. "Well I guess there is no harm in having you wank over us while at least one of us pretends to be a mailgirl," Cara offered. Emily stared at Cara wondering who the mailgirl would be tonight. Twins they may be but when her sister was like this, Emily could never read her thoughts.<br><br>Rod meanwhile nodded his agreement. "It's twisted but sounds like fun," he accepted. "Let's go," he added before things got any weirder. They quickly drank up. Cara noted that the remaining eyes in the room were on the action on the screen. Except for two. A young muscular guy sitting at the next table had been watching them. Before Emily could smooth her skirt back down, he squeaked his chair on floor to turn it closer to them. "Nice legs," he told Emily. He held a stare that suggested he had heard at least something, likely their agreement to leave with Rod.<br><br>Emily looked to Cara who made it clear that Emily should deal with him on her own. Emily turned back to the man on the chair and smiled at him.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay Davenport was confident in her own abilities to use the communications technology with the Tokyo office. She also knew Mr Harada's limitations in that regard so she made no big deal about that, alone in her office, she had connected via the video feed to Mr Harada's account a minute or two ahead of Mr Harada and was waiting. Just before the time ticked over to the hour, Mr Harada's male assistant's face appeared on Lindsay's screen.<br><br>"Hello, Kosuke," she called out to him, but got no response from the assistant who was preoccupied with setting up the connection just right for Mr Harada. Lindsay waited for Mr Harada to appear on the screen. When she saw him she started in surprise at his appearance. How long had it been since she had last seen the man who ran the company? "You look a bit pale, sir," she stated, with some concern in her voice. And not adding that he looked frail too.<br><br>"There's nothing wrong with me!" he snapped back. After Lindsay obsequiously apologised, Mr Harada got onto to what was on his mind. "I saw the broadcast," he told her with some firmness. "You are making some progress. But you are not moving as quickly as I had hoped." Lindsay started to complain but Mr Harada held up his hand for her to stop. Just as well, Lindsay realised. He had stopped her from making excuses that would have made her sound like Mitch. Which she realised was not a good idea. "I am going to help you," Mr Harada continued. "You know Mrs Ogawa?" The assistant must have been monitoring the camera which pulled back from Mr Harada and revealed a stern, black clad woman standing behind him.<br><br>"I have heard of you, Mrs Ogawa," Lindsay started.<br><br>"Don't bother," Mr Harada snapped, "she doesn't speak any English." Lindsay looked concerned. "But she knows how to deal with mailgirls," he announced. "I am sending her back to your office to help you sort out your mailgirl problem." Lindsay could see that there was no room for discussion or explanation possible in the moment. Or even to find what he thought the problem was. She would have to sort out the details with the assistant later.<br><br>"Call a mailgirl in," Mr Harada ordered her. Lindsay looked down the list on the app of who was available and decided that Pam was the safest bet. Mr Harada explained a little of what he expected Mrs Ogawa to achieve while they waited, which involved her enforcing discipline where he believed it did not currently exist. It took some time as he needed to tell Lindsay in English and Mrs Ogawa in Japanese. Lindsay noted that Mrs Ogawa smiled when Mr Harada briefed her, a smile with intent, a smile which disturbed Lindsay. She kept her poker face however, thinking that anything Mrs Ogawa attempted in Melbourne would affect only the mailgirls, not her.<br><br>Pam entered her office. "Yes?" she asked Lindsay with an air of curiosity. Lindsay gestured to her to come around to her side of the desk. The busty model stepped around to the corner of the desk, unsure what Lindsay wanted of her.<br><br>"The mailgirl is here," Lindsay told the Japanese office. She gestured to Pam to come right around, so that she would be in the camera's range. The mailgirl sidled closer to Lindsay, now completely unsure. Lindsay gestured to Pam to stare into the camera.<br><br>Mr Harada stared back at Pam as her breasts dangled when she leant down to see what was going on in Japan. Mrs Ogawa stood stiffly, looking detached, behind him. "Oh," Mr Harada exclaimed, "I like that one."<br><br>Pam smiled back because she correctly assumed that was expected of her. She stood back up straight, one thigh near to where Lindsay had her hand on the armrest of her chair. Pam wondered whether Lindsay would try to touch her or whether she should torment Lindsay by pressing her bare thigh against her arm. They were so close that would be easy.<br><br>Mr Harada interrupted those thoughts. "Mailgirl, spread your legs!" he barked. Pam looked to Lindsay who appeared to defer to her boss. Well, Pam thought, that is part of being a mailgirl. Instinctively noting her positioning and the framing of the camera, Pam pressed her thigh against the chair — and Lindsay's arm — for balance while she spread her other leg wide to give Mr Harada and Mrs Ogawa a view of her bare pussy.<br><br>Mr Harada nodded his approval. "Now show me your breasts," he commanded. Pam was about to state that he could already see them when she twigged. She reached underneath her breasts and hefted them towards the camera. And she pressed her leg harder against Lindsay reasoning she might as well get some fun out of tormenting the office boss too.<br><br>Mr Harada barked something in Japanese towards his camera. Pam and Lindsay found that it was addressed to Kosuke who was framing the scene in the Tokyo head office. Kosuke pulled the camera back so that the Melbournites could see that Mr Harada's female assistant was standing next to his chair much as Pam had been before he got her to display to him. Except that Mr Harada's assistant was sharply dressed in her perfectly cut black suit, demurely poised, a distant look on her face.<br><br>Mr Harada barked a short demand at his assistant. Without any hesitation she knelt in front of Mr Harada and unbuttoned his pants. His cock lolled free as she took it in her thin, pale hand. He barked another command at her, apparently for her to hurry. She looked up to him, nodded silent and placed her lips around his still flaccid cock.<br><br>Still holding her breasts towards the camera, now with only one hand, Pam looked down at Lindsay. To attract her attention, she ran her fingers along Lindsay's trapped arms. "Okay," she asked her boss, "what am I supposed to do?"<br><br>Lindsay looked up at the literally looming mailgirl with some amount of uncertainty. Then she looked back at the monitor to see the formally dressed assistant on her knees giving Mr Harada the most engaging blowjob that she could. "I don't know," Lindsay mumbled, "just keep doing what you are doing, I guess." Pam smiled and stroked Lindsay's arm a second time.<br><br>The assistant let go of Mr Harada's cock; it was clear that he was not getting hard. He glared into the screen. "Davenport," he snarled, "tell the mailgirl to play with herself."<br><br>Lindsay looked helplessly up into Pam's eyes. "You heard," she muttered.<br><br>Pam stopped the stroking and gripped her arm. "This is so demeaning," she complained as she detached herself from the Melbourne office boss moving her hand towards her exposed crotch.<br><br>"Precisely," Mr Harada shouted as he forced his cock back into his assistant's mouth. She again tried her best efforts on him, taking all of him into her mouth, letting him out to just lick the helmet, tried blowing on it from close up, kissing it. Pam ran her hand up and down her crotch, toyed with her clit and inserted one and then two fingers inside herself. She tried to feign ecstasy, hoping that she was doing a good job. And she got closer to Lindsay pressing her thigh hard against Lindsay's arm. Lindsay feigned to ignore her. What if Lindsay wanked her off, Pam wondered. She looked at her boss whose gaze was firmly on the screen and the performance in Tokyo.<br><br>The assistant gave up, at least for the moment, holding Mr Harada's cock upwards in her hand as if it had managed to grow hard. "You have been worrying too much about the Australian operation," she told him slowly, carefully enunciating her English.<br><br>Mr Harada bit back. "Don't be stupid!" he cried. Then he thought for a moment. "Well, maybe," he decided.<br><br>The assistant smiled up at him. "You see. We just have to get you relaxed."<br><br>Kosuke spoke up from behind the camera. "Oh that happens to all of us every so often," he suggested.<br><br>Mr Harada did not accept that. "But not to me!" he spat back at Kosuke. He picked up a pen from his desk and threw it in the direction of the camera, presumably at his male assistant. With a sharp gesture from Mr Harada, the teleconference abruptly finished.<br><br>Pam disengaged herself from her proximity to Lindsay, regrouping at the corner of the desk. "Is that how he runs the company?" the mailgirl asked.<br><br>Lindsay would not take that bait. She looked back at the mailgirl with some concern. "I think you have more than that to worry about. Mrs Ogawa is coming."<br><br>Pam looked to her, not aware of any issue with that. "Oh?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay maintained her level of concern. "You would not know. But ask the others, they'll tell you. I only know her by reputation, but I suspect that she can do much more to you than I could even think of."<br><br>Pam went back downstairs to the mezzanine but only Fanny was there. Pam first up mentioned Mrs Ogawa, but Fanny recollected that she did not have much to do with her and suggested bringing it up when Kimiko was around. Pam then told her about Mr Harada's performance or, as she smiled, lack of. And Pam added her part in the occurrence. And about Lindsay.<br><br>Fanny smiled at Pam. "Did you get off on it?" she asked.<br><br>Pam acted demure. "Strangely yes," she conceded. Which was the truth, she suddenly realised. "Oh my god!" she exclaimed to Fanny's amusement.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette Kellerman opened the door to Shane's office and stood at the entrance. He stood up from his desk, adjusting his jacket wondering whether to button it. "Going somewhere?" she asked.<br><br>Shane smiled at the mailgirl who had inadvertently blocked his exit. Realising this she raised one thin arm artfully above her head and then stretched herself out across his doorway ensuring he was trapped.<br><br>Shane decided to explain. "That journalist wants to meet me. I don't want to keep her waiting." He did not sound convincing though as he ogled Annette's body, which she had on full display.<br><br>"Maybe I should accompany you. For protection," she offered sweetly, not making any move, suggesting that she was not going to let him that easily.<br><br>Shane smiled and shook his head. "That wouldn't work on so many levels."<br><br>Annette pouted theatrically. "But didn't she want to interview a mailgirl? This is her big chance."<br><br>Shane chose to parlay. "If you let me out, I promise you I will tell you what she wanted."<br><br>Annette smiled as she relented, leaning back from the door so that Shane could at least try to squeeze past her. "I'll bet she wants to be a mailgirl," she smirked.<br><br>With his face millimetres away from hers, Shane realised something. "Did you have a message for me?" he asked with that boyish grin of his.<br><br>Annette pressed her bare breasts against Shane's side as she played her fingers down the side of his face apparently trying to recall why she had come to his office. "Oh it can wait," she decided. Shane gave her a light pat on the thigh as he completed his escape. Annette reasoned privately that he was the one colleague she would let get away with that.<br><br>Shane walked down the aisle to the back of the discount novelty shop. Rosemary Millwall was there, right in the back corner, apparently deciding which stuffed koala she should purchase.<br><br>"Well, this is certainly cloak and dagger," Shane started.<br><br>"Journalists don't do car parks anymore," Rosemary replied. "I think that this is private enough."<br><br>"You want me to give you the nuclear codes," Shane suggested.<br><br>Rosemary looked at Shane blankly then back at the stuffed koala she was holding. "I want to be a mailgirl for a day," she told the koala.<br><br>Shane heard her clearly. He rolled his eyes. "I should have brought Annette," he smiled.<br><br>Rosemary chose to look away from the soft toy to make eye contact with Shane. "You can make it happen," she told him. Shane ogled her tight bust, her long blonde hair, the hint of shapely hips and long thin legs and hoped that he could indeed make it happen. "You have my number," she whispered.<br><br>"I'll see what I can do," he responded gallantly.<br><br>Back in the office, Shane went straight to Mitch's office deciding it was not a good thing to have any mailgirls or anyone else involved until he could get the news off his chest. Fortunately, he found Mitch alone and blurted the interaction with Rosemary Millwall to him. Mitch just looked at Shane. When he had finished Mitch merely uttered a bland "Wow."<br><br>Shane smiled with the relief of sharing. "Don't ask me why but I was expecting this," he stated.<br><br>Mitch indulged him. "Why?"<br><br>Shane smiled. "I told you not to ask me that. But seriously, it was such an obvious escalation. And sure, she didn't take her clothes off on the first visit but I could tell she was mailgirl curious."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "But you think everyone is mailgirl curious."<br><br>Shane did not disagree. "It was stronger with her," he insisted. "I could tell. There was something."<br><br>Mitch looked hard at his friend and former deputy. "And you're planning to entertain her request?" he suggested.<br><br>Shane's eyes widened at the thought. "Sure." And for the first time he felt that he could make it happen. Then he realised that Mitch was mocking him. Shane wondered. "Hey, what have you heard?" he asked.<br><br>Mitch held that stare. "It's not what I've heard. It's their reactions. This won't end well. Haven't you noticed what the mailgirls are like?"<br><br>"They're fine around me," Shane complained.<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Just wait and see," he offered. Shane stared blankly. So he repeated "just wait and see."<br><br>After all, what could happen in the office if an assertive journalist was allowed to roam free — and naked?<br><br>"Oh," Mitch added like it was no big deal, "Mrs Ogawa is coming back."<br><br>Shane chewed on that news. That seemed like an opportunity, for himself.`

                    content: `Wendy Turnbull was in Belinda Clark's office, up on the ninth floor. Wendy, the mailgirls' supervisor looked to her boss, the head of HR. "I could not find anything in the newspapers," Wendy reported.<br><br>Belinda nodded. "The web news monitoring hasn't seen anything either. There's a bit of chat on socials as you'd expect, but our monitors say that nothing has caught on," the Head of HR added.<br><br>"Trended," Wendy corrected her.<br><br>"Nothing has trended," Belinda added, correcting her idiom.<br><br>A knock on her door. Martin Plaza looked in. "I was checking the web," he interrupted, "nothing." He paused, hoping for a reaction to his initiative. "Strange," he added.<br><br>Belinda looked up indulgently at the junior HR worker. "Any idea why?" she asked.<br><br>Martin shrugged. "It was a scoop by one channel, so the other ones ignored it," he suggested. Wendy nodded at that.<br><br>So did Belinda. "There may be something in that."<br><br>Seeing the conversation, June Lockhart another junior HR staffer, joined in. "Maybe they need a scandal to get interested. Something memorable? I thought it was boring. It was a G rated look at how a standard office runs normally except with hints of naked mailgirls roaming through it. I think they sanitised it too much."<br><br>Martin turned to June. "Well, I don't think they could have included the dildo stations," he pointed out.<br><br>"And that is exactly the problem with their broadcast," June agreed. They both looked to Belinda for her confirmation. They got it.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane Crawford strode into Mitchell Johnson's office. "How good was I?" he exploded to his former boss.<br><br>Mitch looked up. "I didn't notice you were in it."<br><br>Shane suddenly noticed the mailgirl Lauryn Marks was sitting at the meeting table concentrating on her laptop, naked of course. The mailgirl looked up at Shane. "Are you sure you were in it?" she echoed Mitch. "I don't remember seeing you?" She smiled at Mitch.<br><br>"Lauryn's helping me with a project," Mitch told Shane, not needing to explain that Lauryn was formerly a business analyst with the company.<br><br>"That explains why I can never get a mailgirl when I need one." Shane was hoping that sounded like a joke. "Maybe we need more," he added.<br><br>"I'm sure you're right, you need more," Lauryn smirked at Shane. He gave her a strange look back.<br><br>Mitch noticed and looked at her curiously, wondering that there was something in her comment which he probably should not investigate. "Aren't you late for a meeting?" he asked Shane instead.<br><br>"Oh yes," Shane agreed. "But I'm busy with my new responsibilities, so I'll just have to be late."<br><br>"Responsibilities?" Mitch laughed. He looked at Lauryn who shook her head.<br><br>"I'm on call to deal with all the queries about last night. You know the show that I was on," he insisted.<br><br>"Have there been any?" Lauryn asked.<br><br>"There will be." Shane was confident. Of course Lauryn and Mitch smiled at that.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Stuart Broad was concentrating on something on his computer when Annette Kellerman swanned into his office, as usual making sure that she was loud enough to disturb her target from his current task.<br><br>She ran her fingers down one flank, resting her other hand on Stuart's desk, leaning forward provocatively in her usual style. "I've been keep myself in trim for you Stuart. But I haven't seen you for a few days? Where have you been?" the mailgirl demanded.<br><br>"I had some time off. The family flew in, I helped them to settle," Stuart huffed.<br><br>Annette feigned interest. "So, a wife and..."<br><br>"Two girls," Stuart snapped back.<br><br>Annette affected to be unconcerned at Stuart's tone. Anyway, the mailgirls expected it from him. "Do you have to find a school for them?" she continued.<br><br>Stuart nodded, resigned to the conversation but avoiding eye contact, looking away. "That's one of the things that we did, went around and looked at a few prospects."<br><br>"So how are the girls finding Melbourne?" Annette continued. She sidled closer to Stuart.<br><br>He loosed up a little, realising good manners meant that he had no choice. "It's an adventure so far for them, different to the States."<br><br>Annette smiled brightly. "Well, I hope it keeps being an adventure. I'd like to meet them, show them the sights." Apparently unconsciously, she twirled on one foot, a finger teasingly between her lips.<br><br>Stuart noticed. "Ah, umm."<br><br>Annette bent down resting her chin on her palms, quite close now. "Maybe if you need a babysitter? I'm always free," she offered.<br><br>Stuart suppressed any reaction to that. "Thanks," he stated flatly, "I'll get back to you if I need one." He looked down at his watch. "I have a meeting now." He gestured like their interaction was over.<br><br>Annette stood up and realised, checking her app. "Oh yes, that's what I came up here for, to remind you not to be late." She checked the app again, realising that the meeting start time had passed. "Sorry!" she sang out. "I do like your new office," she added quickly as Stuart tried to get past her. "Now that it's finished. I hear that the engineers are almost ready to move in too," she called brightly as Stuart bustled out, clearly concerned to get to the meeting as soon as possible. Annette checked her app again and smiled.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Down on the mezzanine while waiting to be paged for mailgirl duties, Jan Stephenson took Jackson aside. "There was a breach last night," she told the other mailgirl. "Someone was here after hours. About the time of the show."<br><br>Jackson looked confused. "Any idea who?"<br><br>Jan shook her head. "Someone with general access. But that means it could be a lot of people."<br><br>"Why would they come in here? It doesn't make any sense?" Jackson wondered aloud.<br><br>"Well, if I can work out who it is, then there may an obvious explanation," Jan suggested. Since she had worked in IT prior to becoming a mailgirl she had the skills. "I'm working on it." She had hacked in to some of the office systems but not all of them. Jackson was one of the few who knew that so she nodded back at Jan careful to ensure that they had not been overheard.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>In the IT section on level 10, coffee time meant a discussion about the segment.<br><br>"A bit of a letdown," the programmer Brian Taylor offered.<br><br>Fanny Durack wandered into the room and sidled up to Brian's desk. "What were you hoping to see?" the buxom mailgirl challenged.<br><br>"Something less predictable," Brian replied.<br><br>"Yeah, but you have to see it through the eyes of people who don't work here everyday, who don't see the things that we see," Brian's colleague Mark Richardson interrupted.<br><br>"Things like?" Fanny smiled.<br><br>"You know what we mean," Mark answered that.<br><br>Fanny nodded with a wide grin. The men in IT were all trying to make an effort with the mailgirls, trying to be respectful with them. Fanny sympathised with their attempts to an extent. "Yeah," she agreed, "you guys are the lucky few who have had to deal with the change from a workplace where everyone wore clothes to this. And so you know what it is all about."<br><br>"It's not just a boy's fantasy of their ideal workplace where they lounge about watching naked women all day," Mark added.<br><br>"No one asked me what my ideal workplace was," Fanny taunted.<br><br>"Hey," Brian reminded them, "no one asked us if we wanted mailgirls. We were just told it was going to happen. Here are the rules, now obey them or deal with it."<br><br>"Like the reporter said at the end, we're part of a social experiment.. At least she got that right," Mark stated.<br><br>Simon came into the office to see the woman that he was keen on, naked and congenially hanging out with his two mates in the office.<br><br>"Hi Simon," she smiled in a more intimate way than she had with the other two, at least when he had seen them.<br><br>"What have I been missing out on?" he asked, reasonably enough.<br><br>"We were just complaining about the show last night," Mark answered first.<br><br>"Yeah, it wasn't much chop," Simon agreed. "I was just down in HR and they reckon that response to the show in the media and on socials is about zero. So maybe the great public aren't that interested."<br><br>"I'll guess we'll wait to see what the rating are," Fanny suggested.<br><br>"Maybe people realised that they weren't going to see anything," Brian added, then looked into Fanny's eyes. "No offence."<br><br>Fanny shrugged. "You don't have to apologise for our reality." She turned her attention to Simon. "So what's doing?" she asked him.<br><br>Simon tried not too look too happy that the curvy, friendly mailgirl was giving him the attention that he craved. "Oh, I just had to go down to HR to check on something. They thought that their security systems weren't running right. I had a look at it, seems okay." Although he gave the impression that he was not convinced by what he had seen. Fanny filed that away for Jan's attention later. Realising that his two colleagues — and the rest of the section — were otherwise engaged, he leant closer to Fanny. "Can I comment on your appearance?" he asked her.<br><br>Fanny gave him a cheeky grin. "So long as you are respectful."<br><br>Simon glanced at her, taking in her bust, her curves and her friendly face and large eyes. "I think I can do that," he tried. "You look very nice today," he offered. Fanny smiled and nodded. So he went on. "Would you like to have lunch?" he asked.<br><br>Fanny smiled happily back. "I'm not sure how appropriate that would be," she answered softly. "I think rather that we should do dinner. Or maybe breakfast before we start."<br><br>That was music to Simon's ears. "Dinner," he agreed. "With clothes on!"<br><br>Fanny had to laugh. "Don't get ahead of yourself." They both felt strongly that there was something there, something worth exploring.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Annette returned to the mezzanine to find Kimiko in her corner, concentrating on whatever she was doing and Jackson on the phone, clearly just finishing a phone call.<br><br>"Anything interesting?" Annette asked Jackson as she threw herself dramatically spread-eagled on the bench near her.<br><br>"I was trying to find out from the Uni about Mailgirls In The Office but they couldn't — or wouldn't — tell me anything," Jackson reported. She looked mildly frustrated. "I only wanted names."<br><br>"Maybe you got the wrong person?" Annette suggested.<br><br>Jackson looked more closely at Annette. "What's up with you?" she worried.<br><br>"Stuart," she stated dramatically. "He wears me out, but not in a good way!"<br><br>Jan and Pam emerged smiling from the shower area and slinked together towards the other mailgirls. Both held towels, and Jan playfully attempted to dry Pam's long hair with hers. Pam tweaked one of Jan's nipples in response. But they had been listening. "Who wears you out?" Jan asked Annette.<br><br>"If only," Annette continued. "But I do have news. Stuart's family has arrived. His wife and two young daughters. I offered to babysit them."<br><br>Pam gave the others a wide smile. "Stuart's babysitter, I can see that happening," she chortled.<br><br>Annette pretended to look shocked. "Well, he didn't say no," she pouted. There was general laughter at the thought of what might evolve there. Or not.<br><br>Wendy returned and noticed the general mood. "I can tell you something that will probably make you happier," she addressed the group. "So far there's been no reaction to speak of to last night's segment."<br><br>Jackson stood up and went over to join the group, smiling. "Lauryn was right. Everyone will just move onto the next thing."<br><br>Of course, at the mention of her name, Lauryn came into the room. "I was right, was I?" she asked.<br><br>"Of course you were," Jan laughed.<br><br>"About the segment being soon forgotten," Jackson confirmed.<br><br>"Well," Annette started, "except for one tiny little thing." She waited for everyone in the room to give her their attention. "Shane... my friend Shane," she emphasised with a big grin that underlined what all the mailgirls had shared the night before, "has been approached by the journalist. She wants to come back. And as I predicted she wants to be a mailgirl for a day."<br><br>There was silence for a moment until Kimiko spoke up. "She must have realised that what went to air was not going to get her enough attention."<br><br>Lauryn looked around. "Mailgirl for a day! What does she think this is? A funfair?"<br><br>Pam looked to Lauryn, deciding not to think she may be serious. "Well, it is, isn't it? A funfair?"<br><br>Lauryn ignored that and looked to Jackson. " Tell us she can't just waltz in here and take her clothes off, can she?"<br><br>The others also looked to Jackson. For some reason, she absently played with one of her nipples. "I think she can," Jackson suggested, "but I'll check and see. I mean we took on Pam without any complications..."<br><br>"Yes, but that was an employment contract," Lauryn pointed out.<br><br>Jackson nodded. And she realised that this could make the Jevena situation — the American mailgirl who wanted to come to Australia — even more of a threat to what they had.<br><br>Fanny came in and noticed what looked like a meeting going on. Except because it was a mailgirls meeting, Jackson was in the centre of the girls playing with both her nipples now while Wendy and Kimiko both stayed back and watched. Jan stepped close to Jackson and ran her fingers lightly up her thigh getting a loud moan from the mailgirl who had a moment before been worrying about threats to their employment conditions.<br><br>"What have I missed?" Fanny asked with a smile as Jackson sat back on the bench and spread her legs to allow Jan easier access.<br><br>Annette noticed something about Fanny though. "Fanny, you're glowing, what's going on?" she demanded.<br><br>Fanny looked a little coy. "Um, Simon asked me out to dinner," she admitted.<br><br>"That's fantastic," Pam gushed. "You like him right?"<br><br>Lauryn chose to play the grinch. "Office romances now. Is that allowed?"<br><br>Jan looked up, pausing from the pleasure she had been giving Jackson with her tongue. "As opposed to office casual sex encounters?" she asked with a sticky grin. Jackson grabbed the back of her head and dragged her back in.<br><br>"Wendy?" Pam asked with a smile.<br><br>Wendy shook her head. "It's got nothing to do with me." She paused, since she was after all their supervisor and, despite what she had just said, involved in such things. "So long as it doesn't affect your work," she concluded. And smiled.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay stared at Stuart as he bustled into the room. "We're just waiting on Shane now," she announced to the other two who were sitting relaxed, waiting; Belinda the head of HR and Betty Cuthbert, Lindsay's PA who had settled herself down away from the actual executives, at the far end of the boardroom table. She sat below a print of a naked woman with her legs obscenely help open by ropes wrapped around each leg then tied behind her.<br><br>Shane strode in, nodding variously at the participants. He planted himself next to Betty Cuthbert who stared at him as if her space had been grossly invaded. He looked up at the print and grinned.<br><br>Lindsay looked at her watch. "I'm glad that we all managed to finally make it here. It's not like I spring these meetings on you. I presume that you have all done the pre-reading." She was now staring at Shane. He smiled back. Lindsay suspected it did not matter whether he had read the reports or not.<br><br>Stuart coughed. Lindsay stopped her introduction as they all looked to him. "Don't we need a mailgirl?" he asked.<br><br>Shane raised an eyebrow. Betty cursed him silently under her breath. She could manage anything that they got a mailgirl to do. And she had clothes on. Rolling her eyes she wondered if that was the point.<br><br>"Mr Harada would want it," Shane helpfully offered.<br><br>"Mr Harada can't attend," Lindsay tried.<br><br>Shane smiled at Stuart who did not quite get his intent. "You wouldn't want him to find out," Shane added as if that was Stuart's point.<br><br>"Okay," sighed Lindsay who went down her app to try to chose the easiest one. "We can read through the financials while we are waiting," she suggested.<br><br>Pam Burridge strolled in a moment later. "What's up?" she asked, looking around the room, worried how concerned she should be about being called into a meeting with the management.<br><br>Shane spoke up. "You don't have to worry, Pam. We are not allowed to run these meetings unless we have a mailgirl present." Pam looked like she felt there must be more to it. But Shane continued as she strode behind Lindsay at the head of the table and around to the far side to sit by herself facing most of the others across the table. She arranged herself demurely and looked over to Shane.<br><br>"All you need to do is pour coffee for Stuart at regular intervals. And sit there like the attractive woman you are," Shane advised. Pam shrugged like she was not sure whether such objectification was acceptable or not. But on balance she liked being underestimated. She would pay more attention than the others there would realise. A former model, she had enough experience of what she could do with her large blue eyes, wavy shoulder length hair and her prominent, exposed breasts. She sat back in her chair trying to look vacant as Lindsay began with the business she wanted to discuss.<br><br>The first item was Mrs Ogawa. "For those not on the rumour mill, she is due here in a few days to help with the mailgirls," Lindsay announced. "During that time she will report directly to me." Belinda looked concerned. The mailgirls were her responsibility as was their supervisor Wendy. She sensed there could be issues. But she would sort those out later. There was talk of the company's performance and its financial state. Stuart seemed to be all over that, suggesting that there was nothing to worry about. They were making good profits on their contracts and everyone had enough work to do.<br><br>Pam was drifting off a bit which she knew was a good thing. She sat back, relaxed in her seat. And she maintained her disinterest when Stuart pointed to the next item, the number of mailgirls in the office. Pam wondered what she could do to deflect the others from her interest in that topic. She slid a hand off her armrest and began to gently wank herself. The others in the room either did not notice or made an effort to pretend not to, with the exception of Shane who grinned across the table at her. Pam found a rhythm where she could wank herself to nice undulations, her eyes half closed while also paying attention to what was being said.<br><br>Lindsay indicated that they had an application for an American mailgirl to transfer to Melbourne. Shane coughed politely and the others looked to him. He turned to Stuart. "What about yours?" he asked but found the American prepared.<br><br>"I have attached the American standard contract," Stuart announced, "you've all read it?" He waited for a moment. "It's quite different to the ones the current mailgirls have at the moment. I suggest that we get the lawyers to have a look at it."<br><br>Shane and Belinda looked to each other. They were the only two in the meeting with the corporate knowledge that Stuart's suggestion had been tried. No lawyers would touch the job. Which was how they engaged Jackson to draft the contracts which was why the contracts were as they were. And why Jackson was now a mailgirl. They both chose to say nothing. Pam through her half closed eyes noted their shared look of concern as she continued to run her hand lightly over her pussy. She even pressed up one knee against the table as if she was trying to get better access and ignoring the discussion going on around her.<br><br>"I'll leave it to you to find a lawyer," Lindsay told Stuart.<br><br>"What about your mailgirl?" Shane asked Stuart again.<br><br>Stuart shuddered then regained himself. This time he couldn't avoid. "We may have an opportunity to recruit locally," he mumbled, staring at his laptop. "With their projected time off and their unexpected absences and with the imminent arrival of the engineers on Level 11, I think we can justify another two of them."<br><br>"And the cost?" Belinda asked.<br><br>"I'll check with Mr Harada," Lindsay promised.<br><br>Shane spoke up. "He'll be for it. He always likes new mailgirls." He grinned around the table and tried to get Pam's attention. She made to be totally caught up in her efforts, now twisting a nipple with her free hand. Shane looked to Stuart and gestured at the mailgirl. "We need more of that," Shane told Stuart who acted like he had not noticed her jilling. Betty shook her head. The others refused to react.<br><br>Lindsay began to discuss one of their engineering contracts. Stuart looked over to Pam and asked "coffee" in a firm voice. Pam chose not to respond, busy as she was.<br><br>"Coffee," Betty hissed at Pam who suddenly stopped what she was doing sat up straight and looked around as if she had just woken.<br><br>"Please," Stuart ordered her. Pam stood up, licked her fingers, patted down her landing strip, and asked Stuart how he liked his coffee. She went over to the coffee machine and turned to ask if any others wanted one. Stuart was the only order. When it was ready, Pam carefully walked it around to where Stuart sat. She had to lean close to place it in front of him to Shane's active pleasure and to the private amusement of Lindsay who did not mind seeing the uptight manager squirm whenever a naked office worker got too close to him. She could see that Pam knew exactly what she was doing, how she rested a breast against his arm for just a moment while making sure that she did not spill anything from the cup into the saucer. Lindsay sensed that she may be able to use the mailgirls to her advantage if she could conjure instances like that.<br><br>"Any other matters?" Lindsay asked.<br><br>Shane spoke up. "Sorry, I could not get it on the papers in time, but something has come up. The journalist Rosemary Millwall wants to do a follow up."<br><br>Betty groaned. Lindsay gave her a look then asked Shane "what does she want this time?"<br><br>Shane grinned as wide as he could so those who did not already know guessed straight away. "She wants to be a mailgirl for a day."<br><br>Belinda butted in. "There are issues, Health and Safety, our liability in case something goes wrong..."<br><br>Lindsay cut her off. "Mr Harada will love it. Let's make it happen." Shane smiled at Belinda and that was that.<br><br>The meeting finished. Some of the attendees — Betty and Belinda — could not get out fast enough. Shane made his way out at the same time as Lindsay, explaining to her how he thought Rosemary's return could play out.<br><br>Stuart was not quick to leave and found Pam looming over him, asking if he had finished his coffee yet. They both reached for the cup at the same time and Pam found her hand on top of his. Instinctively he looked up at her as she let him go, her breasts swaying close to his face.<br><br>"Sorry," she said.<br><br>"I'm finished with it," he replied, trying to keep his even tone.<br><br>Still holding eye contact, Pam smiled at Stuart. "I'm a much better babysitter than Annette," she insisted.<br><br>Stuart flinched. Then he regained a little dignity. "I am sure there must be babysitters in Melbourne who are not mailgirls," he snapped.<br><br>Pam decided not to respond as she picked up the cup this time without confusion and walked it round to the other side of the table, swinging her bare hips as she went. She did not need to spar any further. She had plenty to report back to the mezzanine.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson's mobile was ringing as she stepped out of the shower at the end of the day, ready to dry herself and get dressed for outside. It was her friend Samantha. She plonked herself down on her towel on the bench and answered it.<br><br>"Samantha, haven't heard from you for a quick while?"<br><br>"Hi," said Samantha, "are you at work still? Do you have your clothes on?"<br><br>Jackson laughed. "What sort of question is that?"<br><br>Samantha laughed back. "We usually don't watch that sort of show but..."<br><br>"But?" asked Jackson trying to sound amused at the inference.<br><br>"You know the show I'm talking about," Samantha added.<br><br>Jackson decided to make her work for revelation, friend or not. "Tell me," she asked, "I'm Not A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here?"<br><br>"Very funny. I watched it with Charlotte and Carrie, couldn't get hold of you. Funny that. Charlotte straight away worked out that it's the sort of the thing you'd get tied up in. Since you're no longer with the union, it's obvious you're looking after the downtrodden naked mail women in that Japanese company. Carrie reckons you're probably one of them yourself, but Charlotte and I agree that you would never go that far. You're probably their manager or something."<br><br>"I appreciate your faith in me," Jackson smiled. Jan came out of the shower drying her hair and seeing Jackson was engrossed in the call, she ruffled Jackson's hair, tickled her ears and then ran her fingers gently down her back.<br><br>"So now that I've finally got you," Charlotte ordered, "you are coming out with us on Friday night to sort this out once and for all. And no excuses." Reaching from behind, Jan twisted Jackson's nipples since Jackson had her hands busy with her call. Jan smiled at how hard they were.<br><br>Regardless, Jackson tried to shake Jan off her breasts. "Okay," she conceded over the phone, "I surrender. I'll be there."<br><br>"Good," Charlotte replied. "And for God's sake put some clothes on!" She laughed and hung up.<br><br>With the call over Jan let go of Jackson and sat herself down on the bench next to her. "I've been thinking," she told Jackson, "how much English do you think Mrs Ogawa has?"<br><br>"She doesn't speak English," Jackson replied automatically. Then she stopped. And looked at Jan, concerned.<br><br>"Exactly," Jan concluded, "we need to be careful with what we say around her." Jackson nodded. Another thing.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Ian Baker sat opposite Pam at a table at the bar. Something clearly was on his mind. "I was watching television on Tuesday night," he started.<br><br>She smiled sweetly back at him. "I was out with some of the girls from work," she replied. "What was on?"<br><br>Ian tried to look relaxed as he held his gaze into Pam's eyes. "I think you were," he strained.<br><br>Pam smiled. "Missing Covergirls of the 2020s, Where Are They Now?" she mugged, holding an innocent smile.<br><br>Ian tried to be serious. "Why didn't you tell me?"<br><br>Pam flicked her hair back like everything was in order. "I was working up to it," she admitted.<br><br>"When were you going to tell me?"<br><br>"I don't know, a year or two from now," she smirked. Pam then got a bit more serious. "I was meaning to sooner, really. But then there was the play you took me to. And..." She leaned across the table closer to Ian. "I didn't know if I was allowed to or not."<br><br>Ian sat back in thought for a moment. Pam let him for a time and then felt that she needed to break the silence. "Does this change anything between us?" she worried.<br><br>Ian relaxed, suddenly realising how tense he had got. "Well," he grinned, "I have a million questions. It's well, interesting. And a bit of a turn on imagining you naked in the office there everyday."<br><br>"It's no big deal," Pam started. "It's like modelling but the work is more regular."<br><br>"Really?" asked Ian. "I'm in that game, don't forget. I don't think it could be anything like modelling."<br><br>"Question for you," Pam decided. "Why did you take me to that play?"<br><br>Ian laughed. "I had a hunch. But you played up to them so well, it made me think that there was no way you could be a mailgirl if you thought of them the way you spoke about it on the stage."<br><br>"Well now my cover is blown, what now?"<br><br>"We should probably go back to my place where I can start to get the details from you about your secret life."<br><br>Pam smiled back. "I don't think it is as exciting as you are hoping. But yes, your place sounds a good idea." Now she was worried. Just how much should she tell him?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jonathan Davis, Jan Stephenson's boyfriend was waiting for her when she got home from work Wednesday. "You got home late last night?" he suggested.<br><br>Jan smiled at him as she put her bag and flopped on the couch next to him. "Did I? I don't even remember coming home at all," she responded. "Are you sure? I think I spent the night at Jackson's."<br><br>"It's possible," Jonathan replied. "So did the girls enjoy it?"<br><br>"Not really," Jan admitted, "the general feeling was that they sensationalised us to no real purpose. And it apparently did not even stir things up on the internet."<br><br>"I could post something on Facebook?"<br><br>"I think you've missed that boat."<br><br>"By the way I thought it was pretty grouse." Jonathan thought for a moment. "Whose arse was that you see for a fraction of a second. First I thought it was yours. But then..."<br><br>"The hair?"<br><br>"Yeah."<br><br>"You better not tell me that you like that one better than mine!"<br><br>"Yours is here."<br><br>"So I have to keep you away from that other one."<br><br>"That's not what I meant!" Jonathan protested as Jan stripped off in front of him. He gave her bare bum a light tap. "But yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing that one up close at all."<br><br>Jan shook her head. "Be grateful for what you've got," she warned. But on the other hand, she did get to see Pam's arse all day. And it was pretty impressive.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Ian and Pam got back to his. They had been chatting about other things on the way, but now inside Ian got back to the point quite quickly. "You were too busy to watch it with me," he accused, firmly and politely.<br><br>Pam missed the tone. "Sorry, you know, the work function," she explained.<br><br>"No partners?" Ian confirmed.<br><br>Pam smiled. "Some of the girls decided to get together. And they invited me over. Making the new girl feel welcome."<br><br>"And did they?" Ian asked directly, with a piercing look. "Make the new girl feel welcome?"<br><br>"Well actually they did. It was the first time I got to relax with them and start to get to know them. And for them to start to get to know me."<br><br>"Should I ask who the girls were?" Ian smiled.<br><br>Pam decided that the game was up. She excused herself and left the room thinking about what the other mailgirls had told her at the gathering about their relationships, Jan in particular hinting at honesty in her relationship. Pam found herself in Ian's bathroom. She sighed and got herself ready. She marched back into the living room where Ian was sitting, waiting. It took him a moment. Pam was completely naked.<br><br>She shrugged and smiled. "Okay," she admitted, "this is how I dress at work. Happy?"<br><br>Pam stood there for a moment. Ian sat. They looked at each other, waiting. Ian spoke up first. "Happy? Not quite yet." Pam watched him, wondering. She did not have to wait long. Ian stretched back on her couch and beckoned her over. "Can I be nice to you?" he asked.<br><br>"I guess so," Pam conceded.<br><br>"I feel like I owe you something," Ian offered. He gently grasped her legs and drew her towards him so that she straddled him. He took a tentative lick of her pussy and then looked up to her. "Tell me about your day," he asked softly as he went back to work on her with his tongue.<br><br>Pam balanced herself on the lounge so that Ian had the access that she needed. "Well," she started, "like most days I went to the office on the tram dressed for the weather, went in, went to our room on the mezzanine floor and took off my clothes to get myself ready."<br><br>"Get yourself ready?" Ian asked.<br><br>"Tidy myself up. You can see what I do." She leaned back far enough for Ian to easily be able to see all of her pussy. "We don't have to be completely bare of hair if we don't want to, but we do have to be tidy. We get inspected every day," she explained.<br><br>"Inspected by your strict boss?"<br><br>"No, by our supervisor. She's not strict, she's lovely. Then we wait for our assignments in the office."<br><br>"What do you do while you wait?" Ian asked, once again pausing from his good works for a moment.<br><br>"I used to cruise the internet when I first started. But some of the other girls are doing courses, professional stuff. I thought I better get some skills too. So I've started a touch typing course. But I'm also doing some office management studies."<br><br>Ian shook his head with a smile. "That wasn't the answer I expected. Don't they have punishments for you. And you have to kneel after you've finished your messages wherever you are in the office?"<br><br>Pam slapped his arm playfully. "No, silly, that's the States. This is Australia. They have to show respect for us here. Mind you we can do that sort of thing, hang around amongst the other workers if we want, kneel down next to their desks, that sort of thing. Or we can just go back to our place on the mezzanine and get on with our stuff."<br><br>"None of this got mentioned in the show," Ian complained. He grabbed her gently by the buttocks as he looked up at Pam's face.<br><br>"I guess that's because they didn't ask," Pam decided.<br><br>"I guess you get turned on being nude and on display all day there. How do you deal with that?"<br><br>Pam slapped her boyfriend gently again. "That's going to have to be a mystery for you," she smiled. "There are some things..." She trailed off for a moment. Then she squeezed Ian's shoulder lightly to attract him back from his ministrations. "It's time for you to get to know me better. Let me help you with the way that I like to get off." She moved one of his hands from her arse to inside her thighs. "Just there," Pam gasped as Ian picked up on what she wanted, making her cum all of a sudden, almost straight away.<br><br>"Wow," he said, amazed at his abilities.<br><br>"Whew, that was good," Pam gushed, just as happy. "Now it's your turn." She knelt and undid his trousers. As his cock bounced up from its confines, Jan smiled. "Now, how do you feel about me showing everything to everyone all day? Seriously?" Pam gave Ian a teasing, testing look. Ian smiled, just a big grin. Which was the answer she wanted. "I may flaunt my body," Pam continued, "but I don't fuck just anyone." She looked at him with hope. "So?"<br><br>Ian looked like he was worrying about things for a moment. Then he grinned. "It's hot!" he exploded.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Belinda Clarke and Jackson stood behind a table presenting to a group of eleven men and two women who were seated like a class. Belinda looked managerial, as she should, in her blazer. Jackson being a mailgirl was completely nude. She had grown out a tuft of hair above her slit which was in a kind of rough heart shape.<br><br>"I'm the head of HR," Belinda announced.<br><br>"And I'm a mailgirl," Jackson added, "if that isn't completely obvious." Jackson thought that would get a laugh. But the group studiously looked back at her, waiting for the presentation to continue.<br><br>They took turns to explain to the engineers that as they were now situated on a floor of the Swanston Street office, they were required to complete Mailgirl Induction training so that they would know how the system worked and what was expected of them in how they interacted with the mailgirls.<br><br>Jackson started to run through the bullet points about the differences between American mailgirls and Australian ones, stressing that what the engineers may had seen in the videos was not the case in Australia. When she noticed some general disgruntlement amongst the attendees. Jackson looked to Belinda then broke from her script to address the group. "There's a problem?" she asked. She stood facing them relaxed, with her printout of the script in her hand. The five in the front row looked behind them for a spokesperson. Eventually they turn to someone in the second row, an older guy who seemed to be their informal leader.<br><br>He cleared his throat and spoke up. "Thanks Jackson," he started, "I'm Mick, Mick Doohan. I think I know what the others want me to say. With all respect and power to you Jackson, I'm not sure what we need them for." A general murmur suggested that Mick was on the money. "What is the problem that we are trying to solve?," he continued, now more confident. "I'm sorry but I'm an engineer. That's the way that we think."<br><br>Jackson smiled, sensing that the group was genuinely interested in the point of it all. "Delivering messages," she tried, immediately wondering if that was enough.<br><br>Mick looked back at the mailgirl. "But we have email. And text. And I guess, the phone." He seemed genuinely interested in unlocking the problem. If they could get to the bottom of it, the engineers may have a solution which did not require women to take their clothes off.<br><br>"Discretion," Jackson tried, wondering if that argument was strong enough. "Via the mailgirl you can be sure that only you and the recipient are involved.<br><br>Mick was clearly trying to understand the point of it. "But you're introducing a third party. And we already have end to end encryption. You're old technology. And you would take longer than an electronic message," he wondered.<br><br>"We have the app," Jackson replied. But she felt that she was losing the argument.<br><br>And Mick leapt onto that one. "Who designed it? Who maintains it?" he asked.<br><br>Belinda tried to help Jackson out. "The IT dept with assistance from BAD Solutions downstairs," she responded.<br><br>Mick turned to her. "With all respect that means that you've got a third party vendor with access to it. There's a security problem point."<br><br>Jackson bit her lip. She felt suddenly exposed with the reason for her nudity stripped away. That tuft of hair just made her situation seem more blatant. And the other matter. Belinda did not know that Jan had hacked the app. And now what if this new group were interested enough and technically capable of finding out?<br><br>"The app only records the mailgirl's delivery start and finish. It has no trace of the actual message," Belinda responded.<br><br>Mick shook his head. "That's what we call metadata. Which is being stored somewhere." He gave her a serious look to convey the problems with that. Then he lightened up a little. "What if the recipient isn't there?"<br><br>Jackson took back over from Belinda, feeling this was her ground. "The mailgirl has to go to look for them. Say the boss wants you for an urgent meeting. They send a mailgirl with a meeting request. If you're not at your desk she has to try to find out where you are while you're away from your email and messaging."<br><br>Mick looked a little happier with that. "But when there aren't urgent meetings?" he asked.<br><br>Jackson smiled slyly. "I know of at least one person here who sends around wine tips, coffee requests and generally unfunny jokes by mailgirl. Despite the metadata, he doesn't leave a trail of non-work emails and messages on the server."<br><br>The bloke sitting next to Mick turned to him. "So they're not a solution to a problem. They're an innovation, a completely new way of doing things, a new paradigm."<br><br>One or two of the others breathed out an "ah" at that revelation. "Yes," cried Jackson more vehemently than she intended. Mick looked unsure.<br><br>At that moment, the door flew open and Kimiko burst into the room. "I've got it from here," she directed Belinda and Jackson, to the whoops of engineer delight. Obviously her reputation had reached the engineers. They all craned forward as she gestured for the two presenters to move over to the side of the room so that she could run the show.<br><br>Kimiko strode out in front of the table and faced the trainees, hands on hips, legs apart. "I don't know what they've been telling you, but the real training starts here," she announced firmly. Belinda and Jackson bent to the inevitable and stepped away to the side.<br><br>Kimiko had done herself up for the event. She wore a long blue wig that tasselled to either side of her breasts. And she had made herself up to look like a Japanese doll with white face paint. Of course she was otherwise nude.<br><br>"So have any of you ever worked in an office with naked women before?" Kimiko asked looking around. She looked over to Belinda and Jackson. "Where's Stuart? Isn't he supposed to be here?"<br><br>Belinda gave Kimiko a 'what can I do' look. So Kimiko continued. "So none of you have, I guess that's not a surprise." She smiled as she looked out over the group which, after the interaction between Mick and Belinda, seemed now empowered to look sceptically at the presentation along with the whole concept. Could she win them back? Even with whatever character Kimiko was playing in front of them? She ignored the tone of the room. "So how do you treat a mailgirl when she comes to your desk?" she challenged. And she strode up close to two of the attendees in the front row.<br><br>"You get turned on by exotic Asian looks?" she challenged. She looked around the room as she paced across the front, attempting to directly engage all of the engineers. "Why am I asking? You're going to be seeing us in the office without our clothes. But what they were going to teach you..." She gestured at Belinda and Jackson who were staring at her. "...was that we are people underneath this appearance and you have to remember to treat us as such."<br><br>The bloke next to Mick put his hand up and Kimiko acknowledged him. "But surely you are trading on your appearance?" he challenged.<br><br>Kimiko leaned back on the table, facing the room and gave the bloke an engaging smile. "So it's all about looks?"<br><br>"It is when you are strutting around the office naked and made up like that," he responded.<br><br>"And that's the issue," Kimiko stated. "There are mailgirls in the office. There's nothing you can do about that. You are in the office. And we have to get on and work with each other." There were some smiles around the group at that. "But we're stuck in our roles, so we need to well... Some of you may have heard some stories." There were grins, some clearly had. Kimiko scrunched the fingers of one hand a few times as she moved moved it towards her crotch. There was silence as the group watched. Some remembered that they were getting this on work time. Kimiko leaned back a little and raised a leg, resting her foot on the table. Her hand was now a centimetre or so away from her exposed pussy. She stopped and looked around. "Now, unlike the American mailgirls we are allowed to do this whenever we want," she smiled as she found her clit.<br><br>"It this before or after you have delivered the message?" Mick asked. "I mean, if it's an urgent message, I wouldn't want to wait until you had finished yourself off."<br><br>Kimiko dug one finger and then two into her slit. "No," she told Mick directly to his face, "we wouldn't keep you waiting if it was urgent." She leaned right back on the desk, her legs now spread wide as she continued wanking.<br><br>One of the women put her hand up. "Is it all right to ask you to stop doing that if we want to give you a message?"<br><br>Kimiko stopped to brush one of her tresses off her breast with the hand that she used on her clit as she smiled at the woman who had asked. "You book us on the app," she told the trainee. "When we accept the booking on our app, you have our complete attention." Kimiko threw her head back for a moment, then staring at the group again, she proceeded to gently wank herself as she continued. "We still have to meet target times for deliveries, so we're not going to waste time doing this when we still have to meet our KPIs."<br><br>The woman thanked Kimiko for her explanation. "Any other questions?" the mailgirl asked, with two fingers knuckle deep in her hole. As there were no further questions, Kimiko sat back up, rocking on the front of the table, but still wanking herself off. "If you watched the TV show, you'll know that this is still a trial program in Australia. As you can see, I want to keep it going, and I can promise that we are all doing our best for high morale in the office." She smiled over at Jackson. "Even my demure colleague over there has been known to get into the swing on occasion." She poked her tongue at Jackson who smiled back. "Now I'm cumming," Kimiko gasped all of a sudden as she indeed did, she shuddered with it for a few moments. She came down, panting for another short moment. Then she smiled at the group. "Thank you, I was cumming. And now I'm going," she laughed. And stood up and left the room.<br><br>No one said anything for a little while. Belinda realising it was up to her, walked back to the centre of the room, facing the trainees. Flatly she stated "Well, I hope you all understand mailgirls now."<br><br>Because there was nothing more that could be said.<br><br>After the engineers had left, Belinda smiled at Jackson as they rearranged the room back, shifting tables out and placing the chairs around them. "I think they missed the point of mailgirls," Belinda suggested. "At least Lindsay and Mr Harada's view of mailgirls."<br><br>Jackson nodded. "They did not really seem interested in the naked female part of mailgirls, did they?"<br><br>Belinda laughed. "Maybe they were overcompensating."<br><br>Jackson smirked at that. But then she though about it. "I'll have to ask Heather what happens with the engineers over there," she decided.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Betty Cuthbert had been in this situation before. Mrs Ogawa sat facing her desk outside Lindsay's office, her suitcase by her side staring silently at Betty as she arrived for the day. She smiled and nodded at her visitor, not bothering to even try to speak to her, remembering that Mrs Ogawa did not even try to speak any English.<br><br>So instead Betty sat at her desk and had a look at her app. She shook her head and then looked over at the apparently patient sternly dressed woman. Who was intently watching her.<br><br>"No Kimiko," Betty enunciated slowly, "yet." Surely Mrs Ogawa could understand the "no Kimiko" part anyway, at least Betty hoped. But there was nothing more she could do for Mrs Ogawa, so Betty relaxed in her seat and logged into her computer and fussed about with making sure she was on top of things for the day. When Stuart Broad marched in.<br><br>"Is Lindsay free?" he asked Betty rapidly as he marched past and opened the door to the manager's office.<br><br>"No," smiled Betty, "but I guess you can see that now."<br><br>Stuart swung around and noticed Mrs Ogawa. "Hello," he stated over-dramatically, "you must be Mrs Ogawa. I'm Stuart Broad, the manager. Welcome to Australia."<br><br>Betty felt like cringing but instead chose to keep her attention away from Stuart as if she did not know who he was. Without regard for Mrs Ogawa's blank stare at him or Betty Cuthbert's attempts to distance herself, Stuart approached close to Mrs Ogawa and held out a hand, hoping to shake hers, presumably. "Stuart Broad," he repeated slowly as if that would help. No response.<br><br>Staring at her app, Betty noticed that Kimiko had now logged on for the day. Hastily, she summoned the mailgirl before someone else could engage her.<br><br>Stuart was still addressing Mrs Ogawa. "I hope that you can improve the mailgirls' attitude," he tried to her apparent disinterest. Fortunately Kimiko had arrived. She quickly recognised the situation. With Stuart still standing in front of Mrs Ogawa, the naked mailgirl knelt by her side as if a conspirator with her against the manager. Kimiko knew that Mrs Ogawa preferred her to submissively kneel in front of her which was not yet possible with Stuart Broad there.<br><br>Without any sort of greeting or acknowledgement, Mrs Ogawa asked the mailgirl who the excitable man was, and Kimiko filled her in while Mrs Ogawa stared impassively at the grinning American. Eventually Stuart achieved the insight that he was not going to be included. He left after telling Betty to send a mailgirl to see him when Lindsay was free.<br><br>With Stuart out of the way, Kimiko was able to sort out what Betty had organised for Mrs Ogawa's stay. She would take Mrs Ogawa to her hotel at the end of the day, after work. Kimiko then told Betty that she would take Mrs Ogawa down to the mezzanine to address the mailgirls. Since she was not allowed to take the lift, Kimiko led Mrs Ogawa down the stairs to the mezzanine. Mrs Ogawa left her suitcase with Betty and hefted her large handbag over her shoulder and followed.<br><br>Knowing that Mrs Ogawa was watching her as she led her down the stairs, Kimiko exaggerated her strides down the steps, knowing how close the other woman was to the rolling of her buttocks as she feigned ignorance of any effect she may being having. Kimiko in the act of balancing herself as she manoeuvred a landing grabbed a thigh apparently absently so that she was completely exposed to Mrs Ogawa, from crack to labia. She even smiled as she tottered for a moment before righting herself and continuing down.<br><br>"You will pay for that," Mrs Ogawa warned to Kimiko's seeming disinterest.<br><br>On the mezzanine, Pam winked at Annette and called her over for a private chat. "You didn't!" Annette exclaimed.<br><br>Pam nodded. "I did. After what you said, I told him."<br><br>"And?" Annette demanded although the other mailgirl's excitement pretty gave it away.<br><br>"He loved the idea, he thinks it's a real turn on," Pam laughed. "So all for the good! Thanks!" she gushed.<br><br>The door to their area swung open. Kimiko strode in, followed at a distance by the stern faced enforcer from Japan. Kimiko looked around the room, as Mrs Ogawa too was taking stock of the situation. Of the seven mailgirls only Fanny was missing. Clearly there was to be an announcement. Those in the room turned from what they were doing to look to Kimiko. Wendy sat at her desk a distance away from where the mailgirls were assembling. She did not get up but she focussed on Mrs Ogawa and the mailgirls, watching for what would occur. Jackson sat on a bench with Lauryn and Jan. Pam and Annette wandered over from where they had been chatting and stood close enough to Kimiko and Mrs Ogawa to appear politely attentive.<br><br>"Our friend has returned," Kimiko addressed her fellow mailgirls. She quickly advised Mrs Ogawa who nodded blandly at them. Translating for Mrs Ogawa, Kimiko told the others that she was visiting from Tokyo to help make the Melbourne mailgirls more like the other mailgirls who worked for Harada Industries, as Mr Harada wanted.<br><br>"Do you know what the normal mailgirl position is when she is being addressed?" Kimiko continued. The other mailgirls looked to each other and then to Kimiko. Apparently they did not. Kimiko got down on her knees, spread them a little and tried to straighten her back. "I think she means like this," she told the others.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa looked unimpressed. She got a short thin switch out of her handbag and strode around Kimiko. Firstly, she tapped inside the mailgirl's knees to try to get her to spread her legs. Kimiko moved them only a centimetre or two further apart which did not impress her trainer. Then Mrs Ogawa tried to force Kimiko to straighten her back further and to thrust out her breasts. Kimiko seemed to be unable to make either of those things happen to her trainer's satisfaction. Clearly not happy, Mrs Ogawa swatted the mailgirl across each breast once. Pam who was closest to Kimiko winced. And audibly gasped. Mrs Ogawa glared at her show of weakness. However, Kimiko turned around to Mrs Ogawa and smiled at her. It was not a smile that any of the mailgirls or even Mrs Ogawa could read.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa stepped close to the still smiling Kimiko. "How much do you weight?" she asked the mailgirl. She looked up to the roof of the mezzanine noting the exposed steel beams there.<br><br>Kimiko thought about it for a moment. "Oh, about 42 kilos," she decided.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa nodded. "That should be good." She took a length of rope out of her carry bag.<br><br>Kimiko looked surprised. "What are you going to do?" she asked with a hint of urgency.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa smiled down at her quarry. "Have you forgotten that I am a Shibari practitioner?"<br><br>Kimiko shrugged. "Maybe."<br><br>Mrs Ogawa held the mailgirl's chin gently as she gave her instructions. "Tell your mailgirls that I wish to have a volunteer. Before I select one."<br><br>To the surprise of everyone, Kimiko reached up and held Mrs Ogawa's chin the same way. This time it was Annette who gasped, but the two combatants ignored her. "You want me really, don't you?" Kimiko smiled right into her face.<br><br>"How very noble," Mrs Ogawa mocked. She stood Kimiko up and began to wrap the rope around the mailgirl. Standing calmly Kimiko explained to the other mailgirls that Mrs Ogawa as a Shibari expert was going to give them a demonstration. She looked back at Mrs Ogawa. "Of course," she told the woman who was winding the rope around her, "as I am a mailgirl you must leave the crotch, my arse and my breasts freely visible. Otherwise I would not be a mailgirl and would be breaking my contract."<br><br>"As you wish," Mrs Ogawa responded and unwound the rope from inside the mailgirl's thighs. When she had finished, Kimiko's arms were secured behind her back and from there the rope was wound around the naked woman's knees. Mrs Ogawa then took the remaining rope and expertly tossed it over one of the metal beams she had identified. As the end of the rope swung back down Mrs Ogawa shouted at Pam and Jan.<br><br>"She wants you two to grab that rope and hoist me up," Kimiko told them.<br><br>"But you'll be upside down," Pam exclaimed.<br><br>"That's correct," Kimiko told her. "It's all alright," she insisted. "Mrs Ogawa knows what she is doing.<br><br>"Okay then," Jan agreed cautiously for the two of them and grabbed the end of the rope. Mrs Ogawa cradled Kimiko's head as the two tall mailgirls carefully tugged on the rope eventually elevating Kimiko's legs off the floor and then above her head. Until finally, completely upside down, Kimiko wrapped her bare feet around the rope for added stability. Mrs Ogawa checked with Kimiko that she felt safe and then let her head go so that she hung completely upside down, the ends of her long black hair just touching the floor.<br><br>"Are you okay," Jackson asked, sidling up to Kimiko.<br><br>"I'm fine," she insisted. "Just so long as those two don't let go." Jackson looked over at Pam and Jan who, sharing the weight between them, seemed well in control of their part of the performance. They smiled hopefully at Jackson.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa spoke rapidly to Kimiko. "She says," Kimiko translated, "that if she had a weight to tie the rope to instead of Jan and Pam holding it, she could leave me here for a while as an exhibition of her talent. But seeing how it is, she is going to let me down now."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson flopped in the chair facing Mitch across his desk. It was just the two of them, and Mitch seemed happy to give her his full attention. "Anything on your mind?" he asked the reclining mailgirl.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "We haven't had a good talk for a while without you putting your hand down there," she started.<br><br>Mitch grinned. "Down there? I didn't know that was what we were now calling it." He glinted at her. "Not only my hand," he added. "But you're not in the mood?"<br><br>"Not in the mood," Jackson agreed. She sighed and stared thoughtfully at her former boss. "I wonder every so often how I ended up like this," gesturing at her obvious lack of clothes.<br><br>"You decided," Mitch pointed out.<br><br>"Oh, I take full responsibility for the ultimate decision. But you certainly helped to sway me. After all, it was your idea. 'Just for three months,' you told me."<br><br>"And yet here we are..." Mitch agreed, wondering where Jackson was heading with the subject.<br><br>"With it now looking quite a lot like a career move for me," she continued, "while you don't seem to now have a career at all."<br><br>Mitch nodded at that while wondering how to retrieve the situation. He sensed that Jackson was not being antagonistic. Rather she clearly had a need to talk something out. "Of course we have created a safe environment for all of you here," he tried.<br><br>"It seems to be under attack though," Jackson reminded him. She wriggled in her seat, straightened herself up. "I know you're on our side, if we consider it like that."<br><br>"But how far can they take it?" Mitch asked. "You know the contracts better than me. And all the Fair Work Commission requirements. I mean you will always be able to wander around the office untouched by anyone..."<br><br>"Unless we want to be touched," Jackson reminded her old boss.<br><br>"Lines haven't been crossed," Mitch insisted.<br><br>"Unless you take into account Shane screwing all the other mailgirls," Jackson smiled. Then stopped. She noticed Mitch's surprise. "Oh, I thought he would have told you. Boys' talk and all that."<br><br>"No," Mitch replied, "he's never mentioned it. Really, all of them?" He looked like he would need some convincing.<br><br>"Forget I mentioned anything," Jackson hurriedly responded. She stood up. "You know, maybe I could do with that relief speciality of yours." She started to edge around Mitch's desk. But he stopped with that glint in his eye.<br><br>"You enjoy it more when you have some support, I think," Mitch reminded her. He looked at his app. "Only Jan and Fanny are free at the moment. I'll call them up here." He concentrated on paging the other mailgirls on his app. Then he looked up at Jackson who was standing, waiting. Mitch smiled like the friend he was. "You can of course get ready while we're waiting for them to come up. You know, down there." They both smiled. "If that's what we are going to call it from now on," Mitch added.<br><br>Jackson propped herself against the corner of Mitch's desk and licked a finger. "Down there," she teased as she ran that wet finger down between her breasts, past her hips to indeed reach down there. She half closed her eyes and mewed quietly with the pleasure she was giving herself, warming up for the main game.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Betty Cuthbert looked up from her work to see Fanny Durack looming at her desk. "She's busy," Betty advised, "seriously busy, you'll have to come back later." She was slightly annoyed that she had not heard the mailgirl coming. She always did and was always ready.<br><br>Fanny smiled at the PA. "No, the message is for you. Belinda wanted to thank you for the minutes of the management meeting. She liked them, said they were pretty good." Fanny let Betty enjoy the praise. But the PA shrugged. She was just doing her job. So the mailgirl continued. "And she wanted to check about the date of the next meeting. She has some holidays coming up and wants to see if she should get someone to deputise for her."<br><br>They sorted the meeting out and then Betty took a breath and stared Fanny in the face. "You're looking different," Betty suggested, trying to find the right description. "Happy," she noted.<br><br>"Happy?" Fanny laughed. She was always happy. Her breasts jiggled as she responded. And ever the researcher Fanny wondered fleetingly what effect that might have on the uptight but usually well disposed PA.<br><br>"Happier," Betty Cuthbert retreated.<br><br>"I'm in love," Fanny announced to her.<br><br>Betty chortled. "As if! Don't make me laugh." She wondered what had come over her to be so bold. And cutting.<br><br>"Mailgirls can find love too," Fanny smirked.<br><br>So she was serious, Betty realised. "Someone in the office?" she asked. Fanny nodded. Betty sighed. "That seems so odd to me. I mean they've seen you, seen everything..." She drifted on that for a moment and then regrouped. "And everyone they work with has too," she added, seemingly quite concerned.<br><br>Fanny adopted a thinking pose, rolling a fist under her chin. "I suppose I haven't thought about it like that," she teased.<br><br>"It's easy for you young people," Betty responded. And she felt quite ancient saying that.<br><br>"You're not that much older yourself," Fanny retorted. She leant down over Betty's desk her face close to Betty's for the intimacy and her breasts enticingly swaying close to the PA. Except the PA was not enticed. She stiffened up and sprung back a little from the encroachment of her naked colleague. Who was not finished with her, by a long shot. "How old are you, Betty?" Fanny asked. "I'd guess that you are not old than thirty at the most."<br><br>"That's very flattering," Betty replied.<br><br>"Come on," Fanny insisted.<br><br>Betty sighed. "Thirty-one."<br><br>Fanny stood up with glee. "See you're not old at all. We're virtually the same generation."<br><br>Something opened up in Betty. "Yes, but you're..." she gestured at Fanny's appearance. "How do you do it? I couldn't... I mean, just the thought of it..." she stammered.<br><br>Fanny wanted to give Betty a hug but knew that would be too much. She gave the PA an embracing grin instead. "It's not for everybody," she started. "And although I studied it and women who do it, I could never imagine doing it myself. For a start, I was scared that these would get in the way." She squeezed her breasts together on the chance that Betty did not know what she was talking about. "And then..." Fanny found herself wondering what actually did happen then. Not the mechanical part of taking her clothes off and becoming a mailgirl. But the psychological click from not imagining herself ever being one to, well, being one. She knew that Jackson had pretty much let Mitch talk her into doing it. And he had essentially done the psychological work for her. And the others? She would have to ask them, another strand of her research. And an important one.<br><br>And Betty was staring at her breasts while she still kept mashing them together. Fanny tripped back to reality wondering, what was going on in Betty's mind at the moment?<br><br>Betty stopped that though, as she reverted to her felicitous self. "Who's the lucky person?" the PA asked the mailgirl, with a real interest in her life.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mrs Ogawa had told Kimiko what she wanted to drink — a crisp white wine — and encouraging Kimiko to order whatever she wanted, had sent her to the bar with her credit card.<br><br>"We could wait for the table service," Kimiko suggested but Mrs Ogawa did not want that, so Kimiko left their table as she wished. Still controlling, Kimiko grumbled to herself. But as she returned with their drinks, a malt whisky for herself with just one icecube, Kimiko recognised what Mrs Ogawa was up to. She sat alone at their table which was pretty much in the centre of the room, a sort of aloof look on her face which an enterprising type may see as a challenge, as she carefully examined everyone else in the bar. Mrs Ogawa wanted that moment alone to assess the others there and to try to control the room. Typical Mrs Ogawa behaviour.<br><br>Kimiko chose to attempt to deflate the domineering woman when she sat back down. "You could have worn something less severe. If we are here for what I think we are here for," she stated flatly.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa held her superior poise. "This is me. I am being honest."<br><br>Kimiko decided she could be critical, given they were in public. "An uptight Office Lady?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa darkened a little, as Kimiko had hoped. "Just as well we are not in the office now."<br><br>Kimiko found she was enjoying herself. "That is why I am talking to you like this, because we are not in the office now. You know the rules. Everything stops at the foyer of the office."<br><br>Mrs Ogawa backed down. "Yes, you are right," the older woman admitted as she looked around the room again. Two well-dressed youngish men still in their business suits, strolled in. They acted not to notice anyone else, apparently deep in a conversation of their own. They did not notice Mrs Ogawa examine them. She turned back to give Kimiko her attention. "I like your dress," she told the mailgirl. "You have chosen nicely for this situation. The floral pattern suits you." She neglected to mention that the dress was short, revealing a lot of Kimiko's shapely thighs.<br><br>Kimiko sipped her drink. "Thank you." She gave Mrs Ogawa a brief examination. "I can take you shopping for some going out clothes, something more appropriate." And smiled, archly. "Now while we're breaking down the barriers, what can I call you?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa did not hesitate. "Ogawa-san."<br><br>Kimiko shook her head. "I mean what can I introduce you to the gaijin as? You do have a first name?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa glared at Kimiko. "Such impertinence." Would there be a price to pay?<br><br>But Kimiko persevered. "That's me. You know who I am. So what is it?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa sighed loudly. "You can tell them my name is Maria."<br><br>Kimiko smiled. "You're kidding, right?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa's face darkened a little. "It will do," she stated and that was that. She looked around. "Those two," she ordered.<br><br>Kimiko looked around the bar and noticed the two men in suits had taken a table not too far away from them. The men were still deep in their conversation over a shared bottle of red wine. "Okay then," Kimiko told Mrs Ogawa, "I'm going to tell them I am here with my uptight mother from Japan who doesn't know any English but I want to show her a good time."<br><br>Mrs Ogawa chose not to respond, to wait on Kimiko's attempt. And indeed, Kimiko went over to the two men, interrupted their conversation and gestured back towards Mrs Ogawa who stared back stonily. However, whatever Kimiko said seemed to work. She returned to the older woman and advised that the two men were happy to get to know them and then escort the two of them the short distance to Mrs Ogawa's hotel.<br><br>Out in the street, on the way, Kimiko looked worried. "Are you sure about this?" she asked Mrs Ogawa.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa seemed relaxed. "Not what I expected of you, Kimiko." She even tried to smile at the two men who seemingly knew no Japanese.<br><br>Kimiko checked again. "So anything goes?" she asked Mrs Ogawa.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa gave her the smallest nod. "Trust me, I'll be in control," she stated like it was going to be easy. Because everything was always within her control.<br><br>In Mrs Ogawa's hotel room Kimiko reminded her which of the men was Todd and which was Mark as, with drinks in hand from her well stocked bar, they lounged on the sofas in what seemed to be an ante room. Kimiko realised that she should not be surprised that the visitor was staying in a suite. Mrs Ogawa told Kimiko what to ask the men next.<br><br>Kimiko smiled sweetly at them. "She would like to know if you would like to be tied up."<br><br>Todd did not seem to flinch at the offer. "Your mother?" he asked, as if to confirm what the deal was.<br><br>Kimiko tried to put on an honest face. "Sorry, she's not mother. She is actually my boss. But she is also an acclaimed shibari practitioner. This is a rare opportunity for you, to experience the work of an expert practitioner."<br><br>Mark who had seemed to be letting Todd take the lead now looked to him then to Kimiko. "Does it hurt?" he asked.<br><br>Kimiko smiled over at him. "Do you want it to?"<br><br>Todd interrupted them. "She looks rather severe." He looked over to Mrs Ogawa who was staring back at him.<br><br>Kimiko laughed like they had read the situation wrongly. "Don't let her looks fool you. She's quite fun when she's out of her office uniform. I mean she's still sadistic, but she's quite fun." Kimiko spoke to Mrs Ogawa as the men watched. Firstly Mrs Ogawa refused, but Kimiko continued. Eventually, Mrs Ogawa nodded and standing stiffly, she slowly unbuttoned her figure hugging blazer revealing a mostly transparent brassiere underneath.<br><br>"Nice," whistled Mark.<br><br>"A piece for a piece, Mark," Kimiko instructed Mark, bringing him back to the bargaining.<br><br>Mark hurriedly shed his shirt, dropping it on the upright of the sofa. Kimiko nodded at Mrs Ogawa who shimmied out of her sheath skirt. Her black g-string was framed by the suspenders that held up her nude stockings. Kimiko looked back to Mark who reacted by removing his shoes, socks and trousers. He was down to his Calvin Klein trunks. "Imaginative!" Kimiko laughed at that.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa approached Mark with the rope and gently pressed him down onto his knees. She rapidly tied his wrists and then after some loops around his torso, she immobilised his feet.<br><br>Todd looked to Kimiko, still resplendent in her floral dress. "Are we?" he enquired of her.<br><br>"Well there's an issue," Kimiko smiled. "If I do this, there's no backsliding from you. You will follow me." Todd nodded, so Kimiko raised the dress and slipped it over her head. She was naked underneath. And with the dress off, she was available to the room with the others still in varying forms of modesty. She looked to Todd who took the hint and quickly stripped everything off. Just as quickly Mrs Ogawa had him trussed up. She wrapped each of his thighs and low on his waist but left his crotch alone. He ended up restrained in a sort of a squat pose with his hands tied in front.<br><br>"You're not going to rob us?" Todd asked from his helpless, prone position.<br><br>Kimiko smiled as she approached Todd, bending down to gently take his hardening cock in her hand. "You should have thought of that before," she smiled. And winked. "But don't worry, that is not what is going to happen. Unless you want to play that out as a fantasy."<br><br>Todd looked to Mark who shrugged as best he could in his restraint.<br><br>Kimiko smiled, pleased that she now had Todd erect in her grip. "Okay, let's have some fun," she announced.<br><br>Mark felt bold. "Do you girls kiss?" he asked.<br><br>Kimiko had been about to position herself on Todd's cock, but she stopped and looked like she was seriously pondering the notion. "I hadn't thought of that," she announced and then asked Mrs Ogawa what she thought about it. "Maybe later," Mrs Ogawa suggested as she released Mark's cock from his Calvin Klein's, letting him rub it around her bare thigh. "First, let's wear these two out."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson stepped into Belinda Clarke's office and stopped. "Where did you get that?" she exclaimed. The head of HR was marching on a running machine that was set up where her meeting table used to be.<br><br>Belinda was working up a sweat but was still in her comfort zone, able to easily converse with the still wide-eyed mailgirl. "Can't have you lot getting all the exercise," she smiled back to Jackson. "And I don't know if you have been reading the latest research about how unhealthy sitting is for you. So our meetings in here will now be stand-up meetings. Unfortunately, I can only fit one of these devices in the room. Otherwise we could all be on the move while we discuss things."<br><br>Jackson got the chance to emit a quick "I see" before Belinda continued.<br><br>"Since you advised me on what we are going to be talking about, I invited Wendy in to the meeting too. And Shane since he's going to be looking after things."<br><br>They waited for a short while until first Wendy and then Shane arrived. They arranged themselves standing near Belinda although the significance was not lost on Jackson that she was standing on one side of Belinda and the other two were on her other side.<br><br>Shane started. "Well, it's pretty straightforward to me. Rosemary comes in, takes her clothes off, does mailgirls things during the day. At some stage she interviews Lindsay again. And then she puts her clothes back on and she goes home."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Well, if you put it like that, Shane," she started. But Belinda intervened.<br><br>"Who bears the liability?" Belinda asked Shane.<br><br>"What could go wrong?" Shane asked with his characteristic innocence.<br><br>"She's not experienced, Shane," Jackson started, "she could fall, sprain something, maybe worse if she goes down on the stairs..."<br><br>"Inappropriate touching," Wendy added. "Although I would hope that won't happen..."<br><br>"If one of our workers does it to one of our mailgirls, we have set procedures," Jackson completed, "there's the tribunal, the process to follow if things are more serious. And the mailgirls are supported by the company."<br><br>"But she's not a worker here," Wendy added. "I'll have no responsibility for her. And if she's 'doing mailgirl things' then she'll have to be on the app just like all the others."<br><br>Shane looked to Belinda. "This can all be sorted out, right?"<br><br>Belinda kept her fast walking pace going but did not miss a beat of her reply. "We have to have all of these issues sorted out, Shane. If something goes wrong. And in case it becomes a celebrity thing to be a mailgirl for a day."<br><br>"Now you're thinking," exclaimed Shane, no doubt imagining the A List knocking on his door hoping for their turn. "But she's not a celebrity, she's a journalist."<br><br>Belinda was ready for that. "Shane, Rosemary was number 27 on the Australia's Most Eligible Countdown."<br><br>Shane looked vexed. He spoke up eventually. "Number 27, are you sure? I thought she was in the forties." He rubbed his hands together. "This is great." He thought he better check who was ahead of her.<br><br>Jackson cleared her throat. "Sorry Shane, but the Fair Work Commission is very particular about who can take their clothes off in an office during working hours. We've been trying to sugarcoat it for you, but we really do need to resolve the red tape here before she can come in. So she can't just turn up here, take her clothes off and all is well."<br><br>Shane shrugged. "Rules are rules, I guess," he smiled in that cute way of his. "Can you sort our whatever needs to be done then so that all the liabilities are resolved? I'm sure we all really want this to happen. For the good of the company. And," he looked straight at Jackson, "it will make Mr Harada happy."<br><br>Belinda looked to Jackson. "Do you think there is a form of a contract that we can get for Rosemary?" There was a sense that this visit was going to happen, and that HR would have to make it work.<br><br>"I'll see what I can do," Jackson conceded.<br><br>"Then we're all good!" Shane insisted as he took a step to the door.<br><br>Wendy went to follow him but Belinda called her for a quick further chat 'on another matter.' So Jackson found herself leaving the room and walking to the stairs with Shane. He turned to her. "Jackson, have you been keeping away from me? I haven't seen you around."<br><br>Jackson smiled at the office number two. "Oh, I've been busy. I've been around, just been other places, I guess." She knew that Shane was looking her over.<br><br>And he sensed something. "Look, I know there's been changes. And you probably don't like all of them. But don't forget it's me. I'm on your side." Jackson looked at him wondering where he was heading. "I want what's best for you and for the office," Shane continued, "and we can make this continue to work. Look, my door's always open and you and I are probably overdue a good chat. Don't be a stranger, okay?"<br><br>Jackson nodded, giving Shane a promise that she would soon take up that invitation. They reached the vestibule and Jackson smiled at Shane. "Is it the stairs or the lifts for you?" she challenged.<br><br>He pressed the button for a lift. "All that walking Belinda was doing in the meeting tired me out," he laughed.<br><br>Jackson felt pleased that he would not be walking down the stairs with her.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Cara was thinking about lunch as she came out of her lecture. A fellow student, a woman dressed unpretentiously who she had seen but did not know walked up to claim her attention. "I liked the show," the stranger told her.<br><br>"Do I know you?" Cara asked her.<br><br>"No, but I was in the audience. I love the mailgirls things. Are you going to do another one?"<br><br>Cara smiled warmly at her. "Since you saw it, you know that performance is pretty much unrepeatable."<br><br>The woman nodded at that truth. "I'm Sue, by the way. Can understand that it can't be repeated. Quite a coup getting Pam Burridge to act for you."<br><br>"Uh-huh," nodded Cara. No point in admitting to the truth of that. "If we get enough new material..." She looked at this Sue and realised. "Okay, give me your contact and if we do another one, I'll give you a call and we'll see." Sue hastily complied. "No promises," Cara advised. She was just finished when her phone rang. She looked at the screen and noting it was Emily, she gave Sue a curt "Sorry" and strode off to find out what her sister was up to.<br><br>"I have news," Emily spurted. She sounded urgent.<br><br>"Where are you?" Cara asked.<br><br>"I'm at home. Get here as soon as you can," Emily advised.<br><br>The first thing Cara realised when she got home that both parents were out. Well, it was a weekday. She went to Emily's room where Emily was kneeling naked in front of her full length mirror. Emily looked up at her sister via the mirror. "You could join me," she suggested.<br><br>Cara stepped closer. "Or I could check that you are being a good mailgirl." She reached down to press her sister's shoulders back. "I think I would enjoy that better." Cara stood behind her sister looking to see if there was anything else that she needed to correct in her sister's stance. Since she could not find anything, she lifted her sister's face with a finger under her chin, for eye contact. "What is it?" she asked.<br><br>Emily smiled back, pleased with herself. "Pam Burridge," she revealed. "I thought out a plan. How to find her. And I did."<br><br>Cara looked extremely pleased. "Tell me, what did you do?"<br><br>Emily sparkled. "Well on a hunch, I staked out Dad's office."<br><br>Cara realised and gave her sister a wide smile. "You mean Pam Burridge works there?"<br><br>Emily nodded. "It was definitely her. Of course, she may have a clothed job there. But I don't think so. Walked into the office casual as can be. Fully clothed. But we mailgirls have a sense, we can sniff out other mailgirls."<br><br>Cara smirked. "Sure."<br><br>Emily smirked back at her sister. "Oh we can tell a like mind."<br><br>Cara conceded that. "Haha, if you say so."<br><br>Emily's widened. She had not finished yet. "There's more," she continued. "You'll never guess who else is a mailgirl?"<br><br>Cara responded straight away, still grinning. "Mum?"<br><br>Emily chortled. "Good guess but no. At least I didn't see her." Emily paused as if that may need further investigation. "Marjorie Jackson." she revealed.<br><br>Cara looked blank. "Huh?" Who was that?<br><br>Emily had her facts. "The union rep. The one from Carringbush. The near miss."<br><br>Cara was not yet on board with that. "Really? Perhaps she was just visiting? Maybe she had business there."<br><br>Emily shook her head at her sister's doubt. "Trust mailgirl mindhunter me. I can spot them. She was arriving about the same time as a number of other staff. Plus she looked like she belonged there, saying hello to others arriving, that sort of thing. And you've forgotten what Destinee said about her."<br><br>"What did Destinee say about her?" Cara asked.<br><br>"You have to pay more attention to other people, Cara," Emily chided. "And respect what they tell you. Destinee virtually told us that Marjorie was a mailgirl."<br><br>"That absolutely doesn't make any sense. So it's probably true," Cara decided.<br><br>Emily shone with her revelation. Her nipples stood out hard. "So what do we do with this knowledge?" she urged her sister.<br><br>Cara shook her head. "I have absolutely no idea. Let me think about it."<br><br>Emily relaxed from her waiting mailgirl pose. "I know one thing I am going to do though. I feel I deserve a reward." She stood up and adopted a stern look. "Take your clothes off. I want to have some fun."<br><br>Cara shrugged as she unbuttoned her blouse. "I guess you deserve it," she admitted as her sister crossed her arms to watch Cara undress.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "Aussie mailgirls are getting turned upside down.", 
                    content: `Kimiko Date strode up to Betty Cuthbert's desk. "Lindsay called me. I guess she's got a message."<br><br>Betty Cuthbert gestured at the Manager's closed door. "She's busy at the moment. My instructions are no interruptions at all." The office boss's PA looked closer at the bleary eyed mailgirl and showed some concern. "You look a bit..." Betty started.<br><br>Kimiko smiled a little vaguely. "I had to take Mrs Ogawa out to get laid last night," she reported back, perking up a bit at the thought of getting a reaction from the uptight office worker who sat safely and conservatively dressed behind her desk. Kimiko lazily scratched just below her breast as she started to come to life.<br><br>But Betty surprised her, holding the mailgirl's stare. "Ah, that would explain it. She probably needed that. How did it go?" Betty breezily asked her.<br><br>Kimiko sighed, now absently scratching a knee. Which meant spreading her legs, just a little. "As well as could be expected," she admitted.<br><br>"And you?" Betty asked with some curiosity.<br><br>Kimiko rolled her eyes. "I was well..." Her nipples hardened at the thought and she felt a wave of pleasure at the memory. The spasm went through her chest as Betty stared, with a wicked smile. "I was a willing participant," the mailgirl admitted.<br><br>Betty tried to suppress a laugh. "Figures," she observed.<br><br>Kimiko woke up fully to the PA's responses. "You're a bit more into this conversation than I expected."<br><br>Betty crossed her arms. "I'm not a complete prude. And now you've got me wondering about Mrs Ogawa..."<br><br>Kimiko raised an eyebrow. "With a cock inside her?" Where was this heading?<br><br>Betty hesitated at that. "Ahhh..." she started, stopping because she was not sure where she wanted to take their conversation from that.<br><br>Kimiko regained her assertiveness. "And you know what that's got me thinking?" she asked a lot sharper now.<br><br>"I'm perfectly fine!" Betty exploded.<br><br>Kimiko placed one hand on the desk leaning close to the PA. "I'm sure you are," she shared. "Just like that response was not an overreaction to potentially someone getting near a truth. Now, I might have a finance background and not be a psychologist about these things, but..."<br><br>Sitting rigid, Betty snapped back "That's enough!"<br><br>But the naked mailgirl smiled back warmly. "Well, you were imagining me and Mrs Ogawa out on the prowl. I'm imagining you and Jackson out there trying to pick up men."<br><br>For some reason Betty saw that slight as a challenge. "I think you'd find that we could attract them," she came back, surprising herself at that automatic reaction.<br><br>Kimiko was up to that challenge. "It's not the attraction I'm thinking of. It's the next step, the implementation." She leant slightly closer in to Betty, now threatening her personal space, her breasts swaying just a little. "What happens next..."<br><br>Betty took back the advantage. "That's enough," she concluded. "Like I said I'm perfectly okay." She checked her app which had pinged a few times. "I think Mrs Ogawa is looking for you," she reported, suddenly fully her officious self. "I'll get another one of you up here to wait for Lindsay," she concluded dismissively.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mrs Ogawa was waiting for Kimiko when she returned to the mezzanine. Jackson and three of the other mailgirls were lounging on the bench evidently also waiting for Kimiko to return to tell them what their visitor wanted. Mrs Ogawa dressed in her usual all-black uniform, buttoned to the neck, glared angrily at Kimiko, but then she always looked angry with Kimiko. Wendy Turnbull, the mailgirl's supervisor sat at her desk a short distance from the group, and looked up from her work when Kimiko came in. Unsure about her own role when Mrs Ogawa was around, Wendy carefully watched the woman apparently sent from Tokyo to improve the Australian mailgirls' attitude through harsh discipline, waiting to see what the enforcer might come up with next.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa snapped at Kimiko, speaking rapidly in Japanese. After their exchange, Kimiko looked to the other mailgirls. "She wants to know why there are only five of us here," she reported. "I told her that Jan is on her way up to Lindsay's office for a message." She looked around. "Where's Fanny?" she realised.<br><br>Wendy spoke up. "She has the day off," she announced like it was no big deal. Because in the Melbourne office of Harada Industries it was no big deal. Only on relatively rare days did all the mailgirls turn up due to holidays, sick days and other perks. Fanny was most likely away on study leave, continuing her post-graduate studies in the psychology of mailgirls. Kimiko told Mrs Ogawa this, but that did not seem to soften her mood. They had another exchange.<br><br>"Mrs Ogawa is not happy with us," Kimiko informed the other mailgirls.<br><br>Lauryn Marks sat up on the bench unconcerned that should could be seen from the other floors of Harada Industries. She yawned. "What else is new?" she wondered.<br><br>Annette looked to Jackson. "We've been through this before with her? Right?" They had defied her to the point of exasperation on her previous visit.<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "That was under Mitch," she reminded the other mailgirl. Things were different now, they all sensed that. Well, all except Pam, the newest addition. But she had learned enough to discretely not say anything or attract any attention to herself. She looked down, concentrating on her laptop, hoping for a ping on her app. It did not happen.<br><br>"So what's the deal, Kimiko?" Lauryn asked. Seemingly she at least did not care for any consequences of being upfront.<br><br>Kimiko received another barrage from Mrs Ogawa and sighed as she updated the others. "She wants to string one of you up," she advised, keeping her attention on Lauryn. "Like she did to me the other day." Mrs Ogawa, a Shibari expert, had bound Kimiko with rope and hung her upside down from the roof of the mezzanine the day before.<br><br>"No way," Lauryn exclaimed. She looked to Jackson who nodded.<br><br>"Not unless you want her to," Jackson advised. Which as they all knew was a basic tenet of their contracts with Harada Industries, their consent was required.<br><br>Kimiko stood there, looking around to the other mailgirls, but clearly none of them was keen to endure what they had seen her do. To some extent that was due to their admiration for the extremes Kimiko had displayed in that performance as well as her other antics. Wanking herself to a loud orgasm in the middle of an office-wide meeting was only one of her exploits.<br><br>"Well," she sighed theatrically, "looks like it will be me again." It was unclear if there was any real reluctance in her statement. Was she at all concerned when Mrs Ogawa revealed that this time she had a counterweight there so she could keep Kimiko suspended upside down from the roof for a lot longer than before? She did not show it.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa faced the Japanese mailgirl, a stony look on her face and the start of the rope in her hands.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch came out of Shane Crawford's office to head to the lift after meeting with the office number two in command. Mitch was in two minds. He could either go back up to the tenth floor to his office and kill some more time before lunch. Or he could catch the lift down and go out looking for a coffee to take up his time that way. He almost did not acknowledge Betty Cuthbert who was sitting at her desk staring at him. "Sorry," he said, "I thought you would be busy."<br><br>Betty ignored her former boss almost ignoring her. "How are you getting on?" she smiled, hoping that there was still a bond there from the work that they used to do together. Mitch shrugged with a smile. If anyone knew that Lindsay was starving him of projects, it would be Betty. "Mrs Ogawa is back, giving Kimiko a hard time," she added, assuming that she should update Mitch on such things.<br><br>Mitch nodded at that but not really processing it. "I'll let you get back to it," he told her, assuming that he was holding up the usually busy PA from her work. He walked out of Betty's area to where he could see down to the mezzanine. Prompted by Betty's warning, he looked down to see that Kimiko was suspended in an intricate rope arrangement. She was openly on display poised on one leg with her toes just barely touching the floor, the other leg bend up and wide, so her pussy was on open display. Her arms were restrained behind her back. Mitch smiled in wonder, then remembered what Betty had just told him.<br><br>Noticing Jackson was sitting on a bench on the mezzanine keeping an eye on Kimiko along with two of the other mailgirls, Mitch decided he better check on what was going on and paged Jackson who looked up, saw him and nodded a promise to come up and see what he wanted.<br><br>Arriving in the viewing area Jackson smiled a greeting at Mitch, getting him to turn away from looking down on Kimiko for a moment. He turned back to look and Jackson stepped right up close next to Mitch to have her eye also on what he was seeing. Kimiko was clearly straining, rocking a little from side to side but otherwise unable to escape from her ordeal.<br><br>"Can't you do anything about her?" Mitch asked Jackson without turning to her, sensing that she was as concerned about what they could see as he was.<br><br>"I don't know," Jackson replied offhand. She had not had a chance to tell Mitch that she had already asked Kimiko who said that she was all right with her plight, that her pose was easier than it looked. Jackson turned to the still preoccupied former office manager. "Used to be I'd ask you if you could do anything," she tried with some levity.<br><br>Mitch was not happy with that response although he did not let on.<br><br>"The other girls are keeping an eye on her," Jackson pointed out.<br><br>Mitch grunted his realisation at that, also deciding that it was good time for him to leave the issue and get himself a coffee. And then he remembered that this was Jackson he was standing near. "Sorry," he backtracked, "we're overdue for one of our chats. Why don't we catch up, say in about an hour?"<br><br>"Sure," Jackson agreed happy to reflect some warmth back, "office husband." Mitch smiled at that shared joke. "I don't have any meetings then. I'll book you in," she added with a smile. She gave him a chaste peck on the cheek and left, feeling that she should at least for the present be down on the mezzanine with Kimiko. Just in case.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Shane's mobile rang. He looked at his computer screen, brought up his calendar for the day, looked at the phone which did not identify the caller. He got up and checked that his door was closed. By the time he got back to his seat, the call had rung off. Shane shrugged and sat back down, swivelled his chair so he was sitting side on to the desk. His phone rang again. He waited for six rings and then he answered it.<br><br>"Can we talk?" the woman on the call asked him.<br><br>"No, Rosemary," Shane answered firmly.<br><br>"Good," she continued. "I hadn't heard from you for a while and was wondering how the arrangements were coming along."<br><br>"There are a few complications..." Shane started.<br><br>"How can there be complications? I come in as I did before, with the crew. I take off my clothes, we film for a while and I leave. It's simple."<br><br>"It's not simple," Shane sighed. He held Pam Burridge's head still so just the head of his cock was in her mouth. He perked up, more like the usual breezy Shane. "It will all work out but I need time. Just got to keep the mailgirls happy!" He jerked his cock back and forwards just a little to enjoy the stimulation to the tip. Pam smiled up at him.<br><br>"The mailgirls?" Rosemary asked incredulously.<br><br>Shane smiled as Pam decided to take him a bit deeper. "If the mailgirls aren't happy, you don't get a show," he told the reporter. "But don't worry, there's not much that we have left to sort out. Can you call me in a few days?" Shane was casual but firm, ending the call there.<br><br>Pam took him out. "Is she giving you trouble?" she asked Shane, holding onto his cock as she looked up at him.<br><br>"You heard," he smiled. "Jackson and HR are trying to work it out. They don't want just anyone coming in here taking their clothes off."<br><br>"Why not?" Pam asked as she gently stroked his shaft to keep it hard.<br><br>Shane gave her his winning boyish smile. "Because they are worried that will erode your rights, maybe affect how much you're paid and how you're treated."<br><br>Pam gently kissed the very tip of Shane's cock as she held it firmly. "Really?" she asked, "all that?"<br><br>Shane took a moment to enjoy the sight of Pam naked at his feet. He reached down to fondle her breasts. "Are you ready to move on?" he whispered at her with a hopeful look on his face.<br><br>Pam started to stand up, maybe to accommodate him. She stopped. "I don't know," she softly responded. So it was no.<br><br>Shane nodded as he leant back in his chair encouraging Pam to go back to taking him deeper in her mouth. "And," he added, as he looked to the ceiling ready to wallow in the sensations that Pam would provide, "I am pretty sure they are right. This does need to be done properly, for your sake." Pam grunted her agreement, with her mouth again full.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson walked confidently into the lunch room on the eighth floor. The journey up from the mezzanine had barely increased her breathing rate. Heck, she realised staring down at her washboard torso, I never thought I'd become like this. Realising that she was an athlete, and fitter than she had ever been before. Her breasts firm, her legs although long and thin were almost becoming muscular. She was sure if she could see her bottom that it would be as firm as her chest. Jackson looked around the unfamiliar room until she found that Mitch was flicking through a magazine on a display away at a side wall. She sidled up to him. "Men's Health?" she asked, surprising him.<br><br>Taken by surprise, Mitch guiltily closed the magazine. It was indeed Men's Health. "How did you know?" he asked.<br><br>Jackson just smiled. "Dumb luck. So tell me, why did you call me up here?"<br><br>Mitch smiled as they stood facing each other, only the crunched magazine in Mitch's hands between them. "I was sick of my office, thought I could do with a change of scenery."<br><br>It was the dead time between morning tea and lunch, so there was only one other person in the room, and he was nursing a coffee and scrolling his phone, for whatever reason out of synch with the rest of the office.<br><br>Jackson found a seat at a table not far from the magazines and sat down as Mitch hovered. "I may as well enjoy it," she suggested, "before we are required to kneel in this place and drink out of bowls on the floor."<br><br>Mitch looked concerned. "That will never happen?" he tried, adding "Coffee? Skim, one sugar?"<br><br>"It happens in The States," Jackson reminded him, "and yes," she added, agreeing to the coffee.<br><br>Mitch took a moment to return from the machine, placing a cup of coffee in front of Jackson and then sitting opposite her holding his cup. "I assume you know everything," he started. "We're getting more mailgirls I hear. Any idea from where?"<br><br>Jackson smiled and sipped at her beverage. "Well, the TV reporter wants to be mailgirl for a day. Although that doesn't count. Apparently Stuart has found one. And they're threatening to bring one over from The States."<br><br>Mitch looked startled. "What!? Stuart has found a mailgirl?" He shook his head at the madness of the uptight American finding a women not his wife to take off her clothes.<br><br>Jackson rolled her eyes. "I know. But apparently Shane knows the whole story. I think that it all happened because Stuart was trying to impress Shane." They both revelled in the weirdness of that for a moment. "But it raises all sorts of issues," Jackson added, suddenly serious.<br><br>"You're concerned about erosion of conditions," Mitch confirmed.<br><br>"Of course. The American one — well, she's quite nice. I've spoken to her and her name's Jeneva. She's being mentored or something by Heather."<br><br>"And how's Heather doing?"<br><br>"Oh, she's killing it. Would you believe? She's a sensation there. But she's doing it on their terms. And Jeneva's, well, she's fine. But she's not one of us..."<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"Well, she's nice enough. But she's an entertainer." Jackson drew out the final word like she had doubts about the meaning of it.<br><br>"You mean she's a..." Mitch let that hang.<br><br>Jackson smiled, realising her unintentional slur. "No, I mean she's actually an entertainer. The US office hires cheerleaders and such. Would-be actors. Where you..."<br><br>Mitch nodded. Then he smiled archly. "Well, at least Shane will be happy."<br><br>Jackson tried not to look too serious. "About that," she started trying to sound light, "there was a lot of gossip in there. I probably shouldn't have spread it."<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Doesn't sound like Shane though, does it?" He tried to share the light moment despite having had his suspicions before Jackson told him about Shane and the other mailgirls. Mitch had after all caught Shane fucking Heather and was sure that he interrupted Shane and Annette once when he had gone into Shane's office without knocking. And had heard rumours about the others. Well, except for Jackson.<br><br>She changed the subject. "I wonder what will happen when my contract comes up again. Maybe they will just let me go." She shrugged at Mitch. "It depends on how much they decide that they need me. Or whether they think I'm the troublemaker and they would be able to run things easier without me."<br><br>Mitch stared back at Jackson, keeping his fingers warm around the coffee cup. "Have you ever thought that they might decide like with me that it is smarter to keep you inside the place where they can keep an eye on you? Rather than have you going rogue outside where they can't control you?"<br><br>"Yeah," Jackson agreed, "maybe you're right." She perked up, shimmering her breasts. "Maybe I have more freedom than I realise."<br><br>Mitch smiled like that was more like it. "What are you going to do with this freedom?" he challenged.<br><br>Jackson put down her coffee and thought for a moment. She pinched both her nipples, hardening them. "Maybe this," she smiled teasingly.<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "I thought I was done with all this when I was moved from office manager," he sighed pretending that it had been — and still was — a burden.<br><br>"Sorry," Jackson pouted as she pinched one nipple hard and started to explore lower with her other hand, "but it doesn't end just because you're no longer the boss."<br><br>"I know," Mitch groaned knowing he cared too much. What could he do?<br><br>Jackson turned around to look for the other colleague in the room. "Hey!" she called out to him. He looked over to her. "Can you come over and help?" Jackson asked.<br><br>He shuffled in his seat. "I guess so," he offered as he slowly got up. He carefully approached Mitch and Jackson as she pushed her chair back from the table, still squeezing her nipples.<br><br>Jackson recognised him. "You're Michael, you worked with Lauryn, right?" she asked. Michael nodded. "Just squeeze my nipples," she instructed him. "I'll look after the rest."<br><br>Michael looked to Mitch who appeared to be fine with what Jackson wanted. "Mrs Ogawa untied Kimiko," she told Mitch as Michael reached from the side and pinched her nipples lightly between two fingers. "You can be a bit rougher," she advised. "And don't worry, I'll tell you if you're too rough." Jackson now had her hands free to toy with her clit.<br><br>"Is Kimiko okay with it all?" Mitch asked.<br><br>Jackson pushed her chair back so she could spread her legs, her feet on the table. She gave a sudden heave but assured Michael that what he was doing was fine. "I think she's being punished by Mrs Ogawa. For something she did after work, I understand," she told Mitch who looked back at her, concerned about that. "I think they have their own rules, those two," she suggested. And then she looked at Michael. "You can use your teeth," she urged, "but do be gentle with that, don't leave any marks." Michael obeyed. Jackson spread her legs, feet against the table, using both hands. "I check up on her of course," she told Mitch haltingly. She was in a rhythm now.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay Davenport strode straight into Stuart Broad's office. "The tall mailgirl came and told me you wanted to have a meeting with me in your office?" She stared hard at Stuart, as usual trying to appear that she was busy and not to be messed around with.<br><br>The recent American arrival looked up at his boss, raising his eyes slowly like he had all the time in the world, all the time that he needed to explain why he had dragged her up to his floor. "It's about the new mailgirl that we approved," he told her.<br><br>"I don't know that we approved anything," she asked.<br><br>Stuart looked down at his computer. "Shane said that Mr Harada liked the idea of new mailgirls and he would support it," he read off his screen. "Minutes of the management meeting," he added. Lindsay shrugged, so Stuart continued. "Based on that I emailed Mr Harada — and copied you — and got an answer from him, an approval. So I think we can go ahead and employ this new mailgirl..."<br><br>Lindsay remembered. "Oh, that girl of yours. Does she have a name?"<br><br>"Monika," he replied.<br><br>"Mayhem," came a female voice from behind Lindsay who turned around like whiplash. A solid woman in a waitress uniform flicked her long, jet black hair behind her ear as she sat at Stuart's meeting table, staring hard at the office manager, no sense of a smile.<br><br>"You are?" Lindsay asked her with a hint of surrender.<br><br>"Monika Mayhem," she assertively replied.<br><br>Lindsay turned back around to face Stuart. "What are you trying to achieve here?" she demanded of her assistant manager.<br><br>"We need more mailgirls, everyone agreed. And she is willing to become one," he replied.<br><br>"And you just chose the first woman you encountered? Is this how we make employment decisions? Do we know anything about her?"<br><br>"Hey, I'm here," called Monika. Evidently the other two were not interested.<br><br>"I interviewed her. She knows what the job entails."<br><br>"I did not know that you were a HR expert. What if everything she told you is a lie?"<br><br>"I'm still here," the waitress announced. Still on dead ears.<br><br>Stuart stared blankly at Lindsay. "Oh come on, the job is not that difficult. HR will check on her ID and that sort of stuff..."<br><br>"And if she turns out to be undercover, I don't know, a journalist or a writer, or she works for someone."<br><br>"I'm listening," Monika tried. She noted that the other two did not in any way acknowledge her. So she rolled down her stockings.<br><br>"She's a waitress at a local cafe. She always work there. Sometimes people just are who they are," Stuart argued.<br><br>"I am who I am," Monika added as she undid her blouse and then unclipped her bra placing them both carefully on the table. "Don't you remember me telling you about my university course?"<br><br>"You don't have designs on her? Do I have to keep a watch on you?" Lindsay asked Stuart. She thought that would get him angry, but he just stared calmly back at her.<br><br>"He better not," Monika warned but got the expected non-response.<br><br>"Don't you see?" Stuart told Lindsay, "this is our chance. Chaos, an opportunity to break their hold, bring them under control."<br><br>Lindsay thought about that for a moment. "I thought they were already chaotic enough."<br><br>"It seems pretty chaotic here," Monika observed. She pushed up her bare breasts towards Stuart who was grinning at Lindsay.<br><br>"Fight them at their own game," Stuart suggested.<br><br>Lindsay thought for a moment then reached her conclusion. "You have the new contract?" she asked, a little happier with the plan.<br><br>Monika loosened her skirt, wriggling out of it and placing it on the table on top of the rest of her clothes. She coughed for attention, but that attracted nothing from the other two. So she placed her thumbs in her pants and slid them down her legs.<br><br>"Not yet," Stuart admitted. "Still working on some of the clauses."<br><br>Monika stretched in her chair, her fair sized breasts wobbling as she moved around. So she stood up, bare to the world. Except apparently to the pair who shared the room with her. "I'm a mailgirl now!" she announced loudly, "Ready for duty!" But apparently even that could not gain their attention.<br><br>"I don't know what the hold-up is," Lindsay harrumphed. "Can't you just get HR to look at it and approve it?"<br><br>"Well, if I'm a mailgirl I ought to be doing mailgirl things," Monika continued. "Do you need me to deliver anything?" Still nothing from the others.<br><br>"They sent it back with a bunch of issues," Stuart admitted.<br><br>"Well, if you don't need me," Monika concluded. She stepped behind Lindsay and out into the office where the engineers were busy at the their desks. One of them looked up so Monika strode over to him. "Hi, I'm the mailgirl," she announced, "do you have any messages for me?"<br><br>Mick Doohan, the engineer who looked up shook his head slowly. "We don't use mailgirls," he gruffly informed her.<br><br>"I'm a naked woman standing here next to you in your office because I'm a mailgirl," Monika tried.<br><br>"I can see that you're naked," Mick told her patiently. "But we have a lot of work to do at the moment. Don't need you."<br><br>Monika shook her head at the attitude, and realised the sensible thing to do was return to Stuart's office. As she entered, Lindsay walked past her possibly not even noticing her. Monika strode back over to the table and stood near where she had folded her clothes.<br><br>Stuart looked up. "Oh there you are," he observed. "We have to go down to HR and sort a few things out." He stood up. Did it even matter that she was naked? What a place.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Heather's ever cheerful face appeared on Jackson's screen, facetiming her from Harada Industries in The States. "Chrissy is out with Jeneva," she told Jackson who was still adjusting the framing of her screen.<br><br>"Good, Jackson responded, "I wanted a private one, just you and me."<br><br>Heather's large blue eyes widened. "Oh?" she asked. The expatriate mailgirl brightened at the thought of what Jackson might want.<br><br>But Jackson started to explain the work situation she was facing, then the differences between the US mailgirls and the Australian ones' contracts and employment conditions. "I know that you're not into it, but I need to have answers so I can keep on top of all this stuff so I can look after all of us," Jackson told Heather.<br><br>Heather nodded. "Okay, I'll see what I can find out. And don't worry, they all think us mailgirls are stupid over here, so it won't be hard to get them to tell all to the dummy." Jackson gave her curious look. "You know what I mean," Heather added. "It's not the first time I've been underestimated." She squeezed her breasts together playing as an unlikely sex kitten. She licked a finger enticingly. "Now tell me all about the screening," she gushed.<br><br>So Jackson told Heather about the get together at hers. "I'm sorry you weren't there. It was kind of a bonding session." Jackson looked slyly at Heather. "There were some confidences traded."<br><br>Heather seemed to perk up. "Meaning?"<br><br>"We went around the table admitting to things." And then the big reveal. "They all fucked Shane." Jackson wondered what Heather's reaction would be. Should she have even mentioned it? Well, it was too late now. She looked hard for Heather's reaction.<br><br>But Heather was smiling broadly. "Yeah, about time," she laughed.<br><br>Jackson stared, startled. "You mean?"<br><br>Heather had that grin, like she had been caught being naughty. "Why not?" she gurgled. Clearly she was recalling her experience of fucking Shane with some pleasure. She leant back and spread her legs like she was letting Shane in. And still grinning at Jackson. While she put that wet finger to work.<br><br>Jackson sat up stiff, clearly not sharing Heather's moment. "I give up," she stated half-heartedly.<br><br>Heather noticed Jackson's distance and stopped what she was doing with a little concern as she realised. "But not you? So you're still saving yourself for Mitch?"<br><br>Jackson stiffened up further. "I'd rather not talk about it."<br><br>Heather shook her head with a grin. "Girl, you're so uptight!"<br><br>"Maybe," Jackson admitted.<br><br>Heather was not finished. "And there you are strutting around the office all day like that. And keeping your legs crossed or whatever."<br><br>Jackson pulled a face. "I wank!" she insisted.<br><br>Heather laughed. "Well, that makes all the difference. So you were surprised?" She went back to lightly fingering herself.<br><br>Jackson tried to relax, tried to catch Heather's vibe. But why couldn't she get off the topic? "Well, I knew about Annette. Well, I asked her to... But I was surprised it was everyone."<br><br>It was Heather's turn to be surprised. "You asked Annette to what?" So Jackson explained to Heather how to get some information out of Shane, she had encouraged Annette to drop in and fuck him. Jackson had felt a little dirty about getting Annette to do it at the time but they got the info, and so far as Jackson could tell everyone had a good time. Heather thought about asking Jackson whether she now felt that she had gone too far. But she had other things on her mind.<br><br>"What chance of getting Jeneva to Australia?" Heather asked, "she really wants to go."<br><br>Jackson relaxed, happy to have the subject changed. "Just like you and America?" she teased.<br><br>Heather was onto that. "Right." That was all she said.<br><br>"I don't know," Jackson admitted. "That's why I'm trying to find out about the workplace things. To try to find out if it would affect us here. You know that we have it much better than the American mailgirls."<br><br>Heather shrugged. "If you say so." Then she noticed something. "What's that look for? What else are you thinking?" she demanded.<br><br>Jackson tried to be careful. "They're different to us," she started. Over here we all have degrees." She thought for a moment and recognised her own knowledge gaps. "Well, most of us. Do you?" she asked.<br><br>Heather flicked back her hair and sat up. "Thanks for asking. Since no one ever has before. Even when I first interviewed to get a job at Harada. Yes, I've got one." Jackson looked at her, waiting. "You're going to laugh," Heather continued. "Unless you want to guess first."<br><br>Jackson knew she was standing on shaky ground. She was not going to make it worse with a bad guess. "No way, tell me."<br><br>Heather folded her arms across her chest. "Nursing. I'm an RN."<br><br>Jackson started. "What? Why the Hell were you in the stockroom?" She was genuinely confused.<br><br>Heather sighed. "The usual story. Long hours, burn out, some things I did that I'm not proud of. And I needed a job toot sweet."<br><br>Jackson tried to look impressed. "Well, that explains your bedside manner."<br><br>Heather laughed. "What bedside manner?"<br><br>Jackson laughed back. "Exactly. Just kidding."<br><br>Heather thought about things. "What about Pam, does she have one?"<br><br>Jackson was on her line. "Marketing."<br><br>Heather nodded. "That figures. So what's your theory?"<br><br>Jackson explained. "Well, apart from Pam, Mitch recruited workers from inside the company and well, you know about Fanny and me. The US seems to go more for looks rather than brains and from what I can work out, what I hear from you, they are recruiting cheerleaders, entertainers, girls from that background."<br><br>Heather nodded. "Ah, I can see what you're getting at. Less experience in a company, easier to manipulate. Yeah that checks out."<br><br>Jackson nodded back. "And don't forget, they are coming from the gig economy. They are used to only getting paid when they get a role or a gig, depending. Which I guess is why they are so blasé about their work conditions. They're not used to all the things we are."<br><br>Heather got serious. "Okay right, and you don't want them to undermine things for us."<br><br>Jackson gave Heather her serious negotiator's look. "Exactly," she concurred. "I know you're having a completely different experience over there to here. But all that stuff we got here is still yours because you're still on an Australian contract. It would be good if we could get any of it for your mates there..."<br><br>"But we have to look after ourselves first right," Heather agreed. "Put the oxygen mask on them only after we put it on ourselves."<br><br>Jackson looked perplexed. "I have no idea what you're talking about."<br><br>Heather shook her head. "Oh girl, you're so wound up. I know. Let me tell you some dirty stories about what we've been up to here, so you can get yourself off to them. Okay?"<br><br>Jackson made like it was going to be terrible burden. "Well, if you have to."<br><br>"That's more like it!" Heather exclaimed, as Jackson allowed herself a smile, leaning back and spreading her legs. And Heather started to tell Jackson about their charity work. "It's called Orgasms for Orthopaedics because, well, their healthcare here, it's so expensive." And she regaled Jackson with the details of a recent public performance which soon had them both turned on.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Nursing their morning coffees, June Lockhart and Martin Plaza sat facing each other across their desks in the HR department. "I still can't believe that the mailgirls thing on telly didn't cause any sort of reaction," June confessed.<br><br>"You know that they are coming back to do another one?" Martin asked her.<br><br>June was suddenly all attention. "What? Why?" she demanded.<br><br>Martin pulled back. "I don't know everything," he admitted, "that's just what I heard, that they're coming back."<br><br>"Oh, and the new mailgirl they're hiring," June added.<br><br>"What?" Martin demanded. It was his turn to be surprised.<br><br>"Oh, the new American manager brought her down here yesterday afternoon. Oh that's right, you left early. Serves you right."<br><br>Martin sighed, close misses being the story of his life. "What was she like?" he asked.<br><br>June thought for a moment. "I only saw her for a moment. She was kind of normal looking, I guess."<br><br>Martin stared down his nose at June. "Kind of normal, is that the best you can do?"<br><br>June smirked. "Why, what did you want? She had straight black hair, normal features. Definitely not a cover girl."<br><br>"Looks like anyone can do it," Martin sneered.<br><br>"Don't be like that. The pay's pretty good. And the work's not that onerous. It would be quite an increase on what I'm getting here."<br><br>Martin stiffened. "You're not thinking?" he trailed.<br><br>"Why not?" June challenged. She stared at Martin for a moment. "Who's interviewing the new mailgirls?" She straightened her shoulders, to push forward her chest.<br><br>"No idea. But since you're interested I'll find out." Martin looked at June, trying to work out if she was serious. He tried not to think about her breasts. "Do you really want to do that stuff?" he asked carefully. "The showers and inspections in front of everyone, that sort of thing. It's..." He did not want to say the word.<br><br>June said it for him. "I don't know that it's humiliating," she countered. "You've heard all the guff about empowerment. Maybe there's something in that." Then she thought for a moment about the possibility and somehow her thoughts went to Kimiko and some of the things she had done. June smiled. "It could be a turn-on. It seems to give them a sort of freedom." June wondered that she was talking herself into the idea. Seeing that Martin was looking pensive, perhaps frightened at what he had started, she continued. "Haven't you ever done anything that could be, um, transgressive?"<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about," he responded too reflexively, conceding the issue to June.<br><br>"I think you do," she smiled. "There's a part of all of us that wants to break out, do something outrageous and never mind the consequences." Martin stared at June silently. He was not going to add to the argument that he had already lost. June pushed her chair back a little from her desk. "But then there's this." She gestured at her body.<br><br>Martin screwed up his face. 'What do you mean?"<br><br>June sighed. "I'm not that good looking am I? I don't think I'm anywhere near the standard of a mailgirl. What do you think?"<br><br>Martin smirked. "Well, I've only ever seen you with your clothes on." Since she asked.<br><br>That was not good enough however for June. "But you must have some idea, whether you think I'm beautiful or not," she insisted. "You must have imagined what I would look like without my clothes on? Some time?"<br><br>Martin crossed his arms. "At this point I have to remind you that we work in HR and there are certain interactions that may not be appropriate in the office," he recited. But he had a spark in his eyes. Should he encourage her?<br><br>June was on a roll. "You started it! So throw that rule book out the window, Mr Standards," she pressed back. "Do you think rude thoughts about me? Do you want to fuck me?" She placed one knee up against the desk to spread herself wide while keeping her gaze on her hapless workmate. Although she was well aware that her sensible slacks did nothing to help make her point. Whatever the point was that she wanted to make. And Martin chose not to answer her outburst. He looked down at his desk.<br><br>June dropped her gaze from Martin. "Sorry, that was inappropriate, you're right," she admitted to him. Even when her mind was racing with the possibilities.<br><br>Martin nodded, consolingly. "Sorry. But since the advent of the mailgirls we have all had to look at things and at each other differently. Before mailgirls, I came to work, treated everyone with respect, was happy to form 'good working relationships' by keeping everyone at a polite distance. And I enjoyed the work and everyone's company during the working day. Now with eight naked girls in the office, you're right, I look at everyone and think well..."<br><br>June laughed, perking back up. "Even Belinda?" she taunted him. Martin could only laugh at that too.<br><br>"I know what you are saying," June continued. "But sex and desire are natural. The mailgirls just push us a step along the path to being more honest and upfront with each other about what we want."<br><br>Martin shook his head at that. "That's easy for you to say. You can see a route to taking your clothes off in the office. Half of us don't have that opportunity."<br><br>June scratched her chin. "Now, that is interesting. But if you saw me naked all day and then I asked you what you were doing that night?"<br><br>"Well that would be different," Martin conceded. He thought he had been walking the correct line by staying mentally distant since the mailgirls started. Now he was not so sure.<br><br>June pressed on. "And would it be acceptable within the rules?"<br><br>Martin noticed that June was sitting up straight in her chair her body poised with intent. "I get the idea that you have been thinking about this a lot. Have you made your mind up?" he asked.<br><br>June laughed. "God no. I have a job here that I like. Why would I give it all up for seven and half hours of exhibitionism each day?"<br><br>Martin felt he should agree. Thoughts of June taking her clothes off were now again filed away. "Well if you put it like that," he helped her conclude.<br><br>But June raised her chin a little as she stared at Martin, wondering. "Indeed," she seemed to be reconsidering, "if I put it like that..."<br><br>Martin shook his head. She was after all a colleague. Which meant, mailgirls in the office or not, he would try to remain safe on his side of the line of office propriety. Or maybe give June a gentle nudge and see where it would lead.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Simon O'Donnell sat at the bar nursing a drink when Fanny Durack swanned into the restaurant, resplendent in an off the shoulder dress which emphasised her curves then flared from the waist to her ankles. Simon's eyes widened as she approached. "You're early," Fanny laughed, "sorry for being on time." She ignored the other eyes in the bar that were fixed on her.<br><br>Simon beamed at this good start. "Wow," he admired, "you can do it with or without clothes on."<br><br>"Do what?" Fanny asked with mock innocence. She flicked her long brown hair away from her face.<br><br>"Are you always the centre of attention?" Simon asked, impressed.<br><br>"Only when I want to be," was her equally playful response. Fanny looked at the glass he was holding. "What are you drinking?" she asked him. "I like my bourbon straight," he replied, showing that was still some remaining.<br><br>"I'm a red wine sort of girl," she suggested, so Simon tried to attract the bartender.<br><br>Their easy conversation continued when they were seated for dinner. They were quite candid. "It's a funny sort of first date," Simon admitted.<br><br>"Me with clothes on?" Fanny suggested.<br><br>"Yeah that," Simon agreed. "And I guess we won't want to talk about mailgirls. We do that enough at work." He smiled.<br><br>Fanny smiled back. "Too right."<br><br>"And it's your area of study so we won't talk about that either. So what else is there?"<br><br>Fanny grinned. "You and me. Everything else. Let's try, okay?"<br><br>Simon nodded. "Well, it's one way to know each other better, finding things we can talk about."<br><br>They laughed as they recited together "we've bared our bodies, now we bare our souls!" Anyone watching could tell that they both knew how they wanted the night to go.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>To his surprise, Lindsay had given Mitch a project with substance. When he heard a gentle knock on his office door, he found that he had been concentrating on in for over an hour, an hour spent without wondering why he was bothering to come into the office or trying to work up a reason to leave his desk that did not involve coffee or food.<br><br>"Come in," he called when the door did not open. He realised that without Betty Cuthbert as some sort of guardian of his time, in his new role, people just tended to march in when they wanted to see him, so this was now unusual. The door opened slowly and with Mitch watching, Kimiko Date slunk into his office.<br><br>"You have a message for me to deliver," the mailgirl smiled wanly as she made her way up to Mitch's desk. He had not called for a mailgirl, obviously they both knew that. Kimiko looked pensive, and Mitch wondered if it was him.<br><br>"I suppose I do," Mitch played along, knowing that the mailgirls had hacked the app.<br><br>Kimiko sat down opposite Mitch and sighed. She slouched in her seat, leaning on an armrest, not at all provocative.<br><br>"What's up?" Mitch asked her with a degree of concern. He was not used to seeing her deflated.<br><br>Kimiko spent a moment, calming down and getting her thoughts together. "That woman," she huffed. "I need to get away from her at least for a short while."<br><br>Mitch reached over and briefly placed his hand gently on hers. "You can be here 'helping me' for as long as you need," he assured her.<br><br>"Thanks," she mumbled.<br><br>"What's getting to you?" Mitch asked. "Do you want to talk it out?" Kimiko nodded, so he probed further. "Is it the tying up from the roof?"<br><br>Kimiko looked Mitch in the eyes. "I can put up with that in isolation. But you must have noticed that she's trying to change the whole mailgirls thing here. And I am supposed to be her mouthpiece. And she also requires me to be with her outside the office. Every night. And now she's planning a performance."<br><br>Mitch looked aghast. "What, after hours?" Kimiko nodded solemnly. He tried to lighted her up. "Would I want to see it?" And realised that he had got that wrong.<br><br>Kimiko shook her head. "No, don't." She looked at Mitch earnestly.<br><br>"I won't then. But, if it's okay with you, I better call the expert." They both knew that he meant Jackson. "Is that okay?" Mitch made sure to confirm that with her. Again she nodded, so Mitch got onto his app and called Jackson up to join them.<br><br>Kimiko got up and flopped onto Mitch's sofa. When Jackson arrived they then put the issue to her.<br><br>"I've been thinking about it," Jackson announced. Kimiko sat, arms in her lap concentrating on Jackson who stood between her and Mitch who concentrated on her from behind his desk. "In my case, I am kind of in the friend zone with Lindsay dragging me out with her." She did not notice that both Kimiko and Mitch momentarily looked shocked. Jackson had been meeting after hours with Lindsay? She missed their surprise as she continued on. "But in your case, Kimiko, it is a bit different. Mrs Ogawa apparently does not understand any English..." Jackson let her doubt float in the ether for a moment but neither of the others seemed to try to grab at it. So she continued. "While Mrs Ogawa is in Melbourne, unless she finds some other Japanese speakers for after hours, she is kind of reliant on you to help her engage with the world. So I guess there is an option for overtime or some extra allowance to cover what you do for her outside the office."<br><br>Kimiko scratched her ear. "I'm not sure I want financial compensation for what's going on, if that's the answer."<br><br>"Perhaps think of it like this," Jackson suggested. "It's not about the money per se. But if Mrs Ogawa is aware that there is a material cost for her demands on you, she might think twice about taking over your life outside of work."<br><br>"Or she might just charge it to the mailgirls program and not care about the cost. Mr Harada does not seem to worry about how much he spends on mailgirls," Mitch wondered.<br><br>Jackson looked over to him. "Well, the alternative is to confront her directly about it. Which could cause a lot of issues. Loss of face, insubordination by underlings, that sort of thing. I'm suggesting this as a roundabout way that could avoid direct provocation, conflict."<br><br>Kimiko nodded. "Worth a try, I guess," she decided. "The worst thing that could happen is that I get paid more money than I already am."<br><br>It was Jackson's turn to look perplexed. "I know it's a turn of phrase. But from what I've seen, there appear to be a whole lot of worst things that could happen to you than getting paid for putting up with her."<br><br>Kimiko sighed. "She's not that bad," she emphasised. "And you know me." She tried to say it with spark, but she was clearly a bit flat.<br><br>Jackson stepped up to the other mailgirl and gently brushed her hair out of her eyes. "You know I'll do whatever I can for you," she told Kimiko.<br><br>Mitch coughed. "Same here, as much as I can," he assured her.<br><br>Kimiko relaxed a bit on the lounge, seemingly satisfied with that support. There was a silence for a moment which started to become awkward since none of them could think of anything to add. Mitch stared at the mailgirls, seated at his desk, Kimiko sat back drinking up the calm and Jackson stood awkwardly between them, poised but unsure what for.<br><br>Jackson made a decision. "Well, if you need me..." she concluded and headed for the door.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Cara walked into Emily's room and found her wearing clothes, sprawled on her back on the bed. So not in a mailgirl mood. "You rang?" she asked her twin.<br><br>Emily did not look over, just kept studying her ceiling. "I'm bored," she announced. "And why aren't we doing something about the mailgirls we uncovered?"<br><br>"Because we have to find the right time and reason," her sister reminded her. "We go there, track them down and say 'we know you're mailgirls' and then what? We have to pick our moment."<br><br>Emily sat up. "Yeah I know. And dad's not the boss, so we can't blackmail him into making me a mailgirl there." She smiled. Did she mean it?<br><br>Cara was unsure. She looked at her sister. "Would you have really done that?"<br><br>Emily smirked. "Like you said, we have to pick our moment." She flopped back down again. "I'm still bored."<br><br>Cara stood, her arms crossed. "You could do something about it yourself, you know."<br><br>Emily did not move. "I want you to do the work. And make it something new, something we haven't done before."<br><br>Cara started to search on her phone. "Why me?" she grumbled as she scrolled.<br><br>Emily turned her head to smile at her sister. "You're the dominant one, I'm the submissive. I thought we worked that out."<br><br>Cara grinned back. "Not the other night."<br><br>Emily looked back to the ceiling. "And I fucked that up," she responded firmly.<br><br>"Hmmm," Cara announced as she paused her scrolling to read the screen. Emily looked over at her, hopeful.<br><br>Cara looked equally inspired, showing Emily her phone. "Look what's on at Laneway. Shibari demonstration, apparently a genuine Japanese practitioner. Madam O from Tokyo. I've always wanted to do that to you. Properly."<br><br>Emily sat up eagerly. "Absolutely, let's go. Do you think there'll be any mailgirls there?"<br><br>Cara looked confused. "I don't immediately see the crossover. Maybe we can take mailgirls off the radar for one night."<br><br>"If you say so," Emily pouted as she stood up and stretched herself. "Well, what do you want me to wear?"<br><br>Cara smiled. "Some decent underwear in case I get the chance to tie you up." Emily chose a little black dress with sleeves, one that showed off her figure but did not reveal whether she was wearing any underwear. Cara quickly got ready in slimfit long pants and a light jacket. They could not have looked more different.<br><br>Backstage at Laneway, Kimiko confronted Mrs Ogawa. "I can't fucking believe that you have to do this in public. They don't pay you enough? Or is this all about ego?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa smiled indulgently. "Is this about stage fright?" she asked Kimiko who had reluctantly dressed in a kimono that Mrs Ogawa had produced for her. "I want this to be consensual," Mrs Ogawa continued. For once she was the calm one, totally relaxed, and it was Kimiko who, agitated, was talking sharply to her. "Are you okay if I strip you completely nude. Or would you prefer to retain some of your modesty?"<br><br>Kimiko crossed her arms, trying to look assertive in all the unfamiliar material. "Modesty," she insisted.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa rebuked that. "You should have invited your friends. Or maybe your colleagues," she suggested.<br><br>Kimiko tried again to ameliorate. "That stays at work," she said weakly.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa walked up to the mailgirl and loosened her kimono and even massaged one of her breasts. "Well, we're about to find out how much of you stays at work. Or if this side of you is also the outside you."<br><br>Kimiko steeled herself not to flinch, not to show any response to Mrs Ogawa's insistent caresses and glared back at Mrs Ogawa who ignored her attempt at rebellion. "You should already know this. Shibari practised properly — as I do it, obviously — is about the disciple finding out truths about themselves, about their limits. And about their real desires," Mrs Ogawa explained dryly, twisting Kimiko's nipple before letting it go to carefully rearrange the outfit on the mailgirl.<br><br>Recomposed Kimiko sneered: "Oh, so you're doing this all for my benefit. I didn't realise. Thank you."<br><br>Mrs Ogawa gave her that dangerous smile in return, the one that implied it did not matter what Kimiko said or how she said it, Mrs Ogawa knew her real desires. "My pleasure," she so politely told the mailgirl, "you will appreciate it."<br><br>One of Laneway's staff stood at the door. "Five dollars," he told the twins, as he looked them up and down. "To keep the riff-raff out." He was either ogling them or checking they met some arbitrary dress standard. They both pulled the appropriate face at his boldness then paid up, went in and looked around to get the scene. Background jazz played over the sound system. A number of people stood against the sides of the bar, drinks already in their hands. Mirrors along the walls reflected the groups and the polished steel and wood of the bars and the décor, creating a sense of distortion. Typical for the crowd, they talked amongst themselves ignoring the situation near the back wall. Where a Japanese woman in a severe black outfit stood glaring at the crowd while a younger Japanese woman in a bright, floral patterned kimono attempted to focus on nothing in particular.<br><br>The twins of course took notice of that exotic pair more than the poseurs in the room, ordered their drinks and marched over to engage the two of them. "Are you here for the show or are you the show?" Cara asked them directly.<br><br>The older woman said nothing, held her stare, a hint of disdain for everyone in the room. The younger one spoke up, to the twins' surprise in a distinct Australian accent. "Yeah," she admitted, "we are the show." She looked over at her companion. "Madam O does not speak English." She spoke rapidly to Mrs Ogawa and then returned to the twins. "She's the Shibari master from Japan. I'm her locally hired translator." She again spoke to the other woman in Japanese. And again returned to the twins. "We should get this demonstration started," she told them. She then announced it to the rest of the room.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa nodded at Kimiko who made a show of shedding her kimono, certain that all eyes were on her. The twins found that they had the best view of the proceedings, literally standing right next to the performers. Kimiko now stood facing into the room, her breasts pointing forward, but her sheer skin-coloured pants gave her a little modesty. Mrs Ogawa produced a rope from her large handbag and proceeded to restrain Kimiko as she stood there, first of all tying her arms behind her back, then looping a collar of rope around her neck and securing the rope above and below Kimiko's breasts. They stood there for a moment. Then Mrs Ogawa then stood back and spoke to Kimiko.<br><br>"Madam O says that this is an easy one to start with, that anyone can do it." Mrs Ogawa spoke to her again. "And she said that it is a light restraint and does not cause the subject any discomfort," Kimiko added with a wry smile. She looked around the room. "Are there any volunteers for the next demonstration?" she asked. Cara nudged Emily unsubtly but Emily shook her head. "I want to see more first," she whispered back to her sister.<br><br>None of the other viewers seemed interested in volunteering. Kimiko shrugged as much as she could and informed Mrs Ogawa of the obvious. In response, Mrs Ogawa untied Kimiko, as they started a discussion which was clearly Mrs Ogawa insisting on something and Kimiko refusing. Finally, as the final loop fell away, Kimiko fell silent. Clearly Mrs Ogawa had won. Kimiko flexed and loosened her arms then held a defiant stare at the uninterested Mrs Ogawa for a moment. Then slowly Kimiko slid her pants down her legs and off. She was naked. And Mrs Ogawa was ready to continue.<br><br>She pushed Kimiko face down, mostly on her stomach then started, tying the rope first to the leg of a conveniently placed chair, then roped one of Kimiko's calves to the chair leg so that she was resting on one knee. The other knee Mrs Ogawa elevated, securing the mailgirl's leg behind her back so that she was spread, exposing her crotch totally to the onlookers. Almost unnecessarily, Mrs Ogawa again wound the rope around Kimiko's breasts and neck. Finally she ceremoniously handed the end of the rope to Cara who tugged it gently which exposed Kimiko further.<br><br>Emily applauded at what seemed to be the end of that demonstration. "That's more like it!" she exploded nudging Cara to try to get a reaction from her. Cara ignored her sister, acting like her responsibility with the rope to expose Kimiko to the room needed all her concentration. But she was mentally taking notes.<br><br>The rest of the onlookers either adopted looks of academic interest in the tableau or chose to ostentatiously look away after a moment of serious reflection on Kimiko's plight. They were not going to be seen as voyeurs. Kimiko help the pose seemingly unselfconsciously for a long moment until Mrs Ogawa carefully took the rope back from Cara to release her.<br><br>Standing still completely naked, Kimiko explained the origins of Shibari as a means of restraint and torture of prisoners in ancient Japan. Now the hipsters could stare candidly at the naked woman since she was educating them in the exotic art. And then Kimiko stressed the pleasurable aspects of the way that it was practised in the now. Most of the crowd looked away, apparently in deep thoughts. Were they shy at the suggestion of sexual satisfaction? During this time, Mrs Ogawa had produced a second rope.<br><br>Emily knew what that meant. "Me!" she squealed. Kimiko spoke to Mrs Ogawa who nodded, with apparently complete disinterest. So that was decided.<br><br>Kimiko smiled at Emily. "Your turn will come," she told her. "But firstly, Madam O will demonstrate a pose of unrequited desire." She nodded at the Shibari master.<br><br>Instructed by Mrs Ogawa, Kimiko knelt down pressing her calves to the back of her thighs until she was flat on the floor so Madam O could tie her calves and thighs together, spreading her legs as she faced the audience. She then bound Kimiko's arms behind her, again wrapped the rope above and below her breasts and for the finish, had Kimiko bite on the rope which then trailed down her stomach.<br><br>Meanwhile, Emily shook out of her dress and in keeping with Kimiko's state she also removed her underwear. Now naked, she watched the tying of Kimiko in a manner suggesting that she had no problem completely exposing herself to the room. And now it was her turn. Madam O placed Emily's hands together in front of her, then bound them together with a complex arrangement that used a lot of the rope. She then bound Emily's feet the same way so that she was immobilised in that position.<br><br>Kimiko looked over at Madam O's work on Emily and let her rope enticingly drop from her mouth. "This is the easiest way to bound a captive," Kimiko explained. "She won't be escaping anywhere." Emily smiled at that notion. And Madam O produced a third rope. "There is a chance for a third volunteer," Kimiko urged the audience. Madam O looked to Cara who chose not to notice.<br><br>There was a hubbub amongst a group in black and leather. "Well, I will," a woman in the group loudly exclaimed. She took off her leather jacket and marched up to Madam O. She took off her top and slipped out of her combat pants, standing there in her bra and panties. She looked over towards her group who remained aloof. "That's enough," she decided and spread her arms as she looked to Mrs Ogawa.<br><br>The Shibari master shrugged as she began work on her third captive. She placed the woman's head down and had her kneeling with her bottom up towards the watchers. Already it was clear that the thin material of the woman's underwear was not hiding much of her genitals. Madam O positioned the woman's arms straight up behind her, tying them together like that. The rope was wrapped across the woman's breasts and around her neck. Madam O gently nudged the woman's legs slightly further apart and wrapped one heel and calf against the back her thigh, exposing her further.<br><br>"She's not going anywhere either," Emily observed with a smile. And as if to underline that fact, Madam O carefully folded the woman's discarded top and combat pants into neat squares and placed them next to her. Madam O went over and studied Emily. After a moment, she untied Emily's feet, only to position Emily so that she was exposed as much as Kimiko was. When Mrs O had finished arranging her, Emily looked back to the Shibari master and smiled at her. To Kimiko's surprise, Mrs Ogawa smiled back at Emily, clearly liking something she saw in her.<br><br>Back in Mrs Ogawa's hotel suite, Kimiko disrobed as she asked the twins what they would like to drink. Emily chose to follow her lead and stripped naked too.<br><br>Cara decided that she should show their hosts what she was made of. "Mailgirl position one," she ordered Emily who obeyed, getting down on her knees, her breasts thrust forward in the well-known pose. Kimiko stiffened involuntarily in reaction. Did Emily or Cara notice and wonder why? Apparently not.<br><br>Recapturing her self control, Kimiko looked over to Cara and asked her "what's position number two?"<br><br>Mrs Ogawa was toying with the end of one of her ropes while Cara started to explain. Mrs Ogawa interrupted her. "I want that one," she told Kimiko indicating at Cara. Kimiko replied that she would see what she could do. She smiled enticingly at Cara as she toyed gently with her own nipples. Cara looked back at Kimiko, first of all confused and then she realised.<br><br>"I think you know what Madam O wants," Kimiko smiled at her.<br><br>Cara, taken with the moment, smiled warmly back at her. "Oh Heck," she decided, "why not."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson stood near Lindsay's meeting table smiling as she watched the office manager question her PA Betty Cuthbert. Jackson had been summoned to bring Betty into Lindsay's office and then told to wait. "So you've tried all the employment lawyers on the list?" Lindsay demanded of her PA.<br><br>Betty, slightly exasperated, nodded that she had. She gave the impression that she was again checking the list on her laptop in case one had escaped her. "The big accounting firms?" Lindsay asked her.<br><br>Betty nodded. "And the second tier ones too," she quickly added. Jackson, certain that Lindsay was not currently interested in her, rocked on the balls of her feet, with her hands behind her back, silently whistling. Neither of them seemed to notice her. "We could call the unions?" Betty suggested to her boss.<br><br>"We are not getting the unions involved in this!" Lindsay exploded. "Harada does not do trade unions."<br><br>Betty shut her laptop and looked directly at Lindsay. "So who else is there?"<br><br>Lindsay looked her right back. "There must be someone. Try harder. Try again. Or something."<br><br>Betty made her way out of the office giving the mailgirl a sly glance which Jackson returned. She then stepped into the full view of Lindsay as Betty shut the door firmly behind her.<br><br>"That woman!" Lindsay complained.<br><br>"If only there was someone in the organisation who knew about labour contracts," Jackson smiled.<br><br>"Don't you take her side too," Lindsay snapped, to Jackson's surprise. "This is so exasperating. Do you know what I need?"<br><br>"A large ice cream cone with chocolate topping and a good night's sleep?" Jackson wondered, finding that she was still rocking on the balls of her feet despite now standing right in front of the office boss.<br><br>"Don't try to be funny," Lindsay responded. "Are you free after work? Take me out tonight, I need a good fuck and I assume that you can take me somewhere to find one."<br><br>Jackson smiled back at her boss patronisingly, having assumed that Lindsay was serious. "We could just go out the front and stand in Swanston Street and I could call out for volunteers."<br><br>Lindsay shook her head. "I intend to be a little more dignified."<br><br>Jackson held her smirk. "There's always Shane."<br><br>Lindsay sniffed and shook her head. "I intend to be a lot more dignified."<br><br>Jackson sniffed back. "And here I was thinking you had no sense of humour."<br><br>But Jackson found herself waiting at the bar of their agreed pickup spot attracting a deal of attention from the men who were after the same thing that Lindsay wanted. Jackson had dressed in bum and thigh hugging pants and a slinky top, not too provocative, she hoped, enjoying the irony when she chose her outfit for the night that a mailgirl should worry about looking too sexy in clothes.<br><br>And she was waiting, as usual for Lindsay. In time honoured fashion, one of the men at the bar smiled at Jackson who decided to play the game and smiled back at him. At which point of course Lindsay wandered in, accustomed her eyes to the dimness of the lighting and marched up to Jackson in a jacket that was a little too shoulder padded and pants that were a little too loose. She reeked of last century's energy. Jackson felt that the sexual tension in the air had cooled a few degrees. Maybe it was the clothes. Maybe it was Lindsay.<br><br>"Am I dressed right?" Lindsay asked her.<br><br>"Perhaps," Jackson answered as honestly as she could. Who knew how the pickup scene worked? Certainly not her. But here she was, with her boss having decided without evidence that she was the expert. With drinks in their hands and no approaches from any men, Jackson tried to give her boss a sympathetic look. But she still she was curious. "Are you able to come to a place like this, find a guy that you want and just take him home or go to his place and fuck him?" she asked Lindsay, seeking information for her own endeavours.<br><br>Lindsay started back at her. "You're getting a bit intrusive."<br><br>"Well, I'm just trying to help. So to find out what sort of man you're looking for. To help you out."<br><br>"What sort of man are you looking for?" Lindsay asked back.<br><br>Jackson appeared to think about that for a moment. "I am not really looking at the moment. But if I was..."<br><br>That let Lindsay butt in with a sudden recollection. "I overheard that you are keeping yourself for Mitch. Is that right?"<br><br>"Well..." stalled Jackson, not really sure what to say to that.<br><br>Lindsay placed a hand on Jackson's shoulder. And shook her head. "That one will never stray. How long has he been around you naked girls without cracking?"<br><br>Jackson laughed, tried to make a joke out of it. "He will. I almost..." she faltered, then recomposed herself, "a few times." She delivered her lines with far more confidence than she felt.<br><br>Lindsay saw right through that. "Almost," she shot back. "Well, I hope you're right. But I think we'll find that I am. That kind doesn't stray. I know, I've tried." Lindsay paused, then tried to reach out with the friendship thing. "How are things going with the mailgirls?" she attempted.<br><br>"Well after the excitement of the TV thing, things have pretty much settled back like before."<br><br>Lindsay shook her head. "We can't have that. Looks like you need a few more changes."<br><br>"Like what?" Jackson asked.<br><br>Lindsay smiled. "All in good time." She looked around the bar and noticed that a pair of businessmen still in their work suits had come in for a drink. Lindsay smiled over at them although she failed at eye contact. Not that she cared. "What do we have here?" she grinned at Jackson like the issue had already been resolved in her favour despite the evidence.<br><br>It was Jackson's turn to touch Lindsay on the shoulder since the men were showing no interest in what was around them. "I think with Australians, you have to let the men feel that they are doing the hunting. If they're even here for the hunting," she suggested.<br><br>Lindsay grudgingly allowed Jackson to lead her to a table that had freed up, away from their spot at the bar where she could size up all of the clientele. A few men looked over their way but none seemed likely to make a move on them. Lindsay leaned forward conspiratorially. "What do I have to do to get myself off in this town? A mailgirl could just sit back and pleasure herself."<br><br>Jackson looked at her concerned. "Not in a bar!" she exclaimed.<br><br>"Well no," Lindsay agreed. "But in the office if you need to..."<br><br>"Yes, that's the whole point of being a mailgirl," Jackson responded, knowing that Lindsay still did not get the nature of Australian mailgirls. Maybe that was why she was trying to turn them into the American variety. "You don't have any toys?" she asked the boss. Lindsay did not answer. "You could always borrow ours from the dildo stations," Jackson continued. "No one uses them overnight." She thought she noticed a strange look on Lindsay's face for a moment.<br><br>"I'll take that on board," was all that Lindsay would say to that suggestion.<br><br>The offers still did not come in. Jackson did not dare tell Lindsay that on a solo trip to the bathroom one of the men lurking at the bar had offered 'to look after her' if she could separate herself from her 'creepy' friend. His words. She wondered how long before Lindsay gave up and she could go home.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson waited on the mezzanine until Jan came back from a message. She looked at the taller mailgirl who shook her head as she flopped down on the bench near Jackson.<br><br>"Engineers?" Jackson asked. She flopped down on her back as if she too was fatigued. That way she could have a quiet chat with Jan without the vigilant Wendy over in the corner getting suspicious.<br><br>"Engineers," Jan answered. "They are going to drive me mad. Just getting them to acknowledge that you have a message for them is hard enough. Then there's the app — which they still don't trust. They're threatening to get right into to it. They are sure they can improve the code."<br><br>"Will we have to disconnect?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"Well, let's just say that we will need to be more discreet."<br><br>"And there's no way to bring them onside?" Jackson asked, turning to look Jan in the eyes.<br><br>"They're engineers," Jan laughed, "they see everyone else as a potential enemy."<br><br>"No doubt they are still suspicious about why they were brought in here."<br><br>"I wonder that myself." Jan rolled her eyes.<br><br>"Sometimes the simplest answers are the right ones. To save money. And to piss them off." Jackson sighed. "But we've got another problem. My friend Lindsay is introducing something new for us. Have you heard anything?"<br><br>Jan shook her head. "Sorry. Whatever it is will be a surprise."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>On Monday morning, Pam ran into Annette and Lauryn in the foyer. Chatting they made their way up to the mezzanine, the first ones to arrive for the morning.<br><br>Lauryn realised first with the understandable exclamation "what the fuck!" The benches had been removed. And replaced with some odd looking chairs. Nine gamer chairs had been fixed to the floor and tilted back. They all pointed in the same direction. As Jan realised when she came onto the mezzanine, they were all tilted up at the viewing window on the eight floor.<br><br>The mailgirls milled around their changed seating, soon joined by Jackson and then Kimiko. Wendy came in shortly after.<br><br>"What do you know about this?" Jan demanded of her. Wendy admitted that she was as surprised as the mailgirls.<br><br>A moment later, Lindsay strode onto the floor. She looked around at the mailgirls, choosing not to favour any of them with her attention. She glanced past Jackson as if she was just another body. "You're mailgirls," she announced, "and I am looking at you all wearing clothes." And she was right. With the shock of the unexpected, the tone set by the first three to arrive, none of them had gone round to the change rooms to get ready for the day.<br><br>"Are they..." started Annette before Lindsay cut her off.<br><br>"There has been no work done to the change rooms or the showers," Lindsay announced. "But clearly there are changes here. We needed to replace the old benches. You will find that these chairs will better display you than the benches did. They are better for your posture. And of course you can more easily and more ergonomically use your laptops when you are seated. No more bad backs." She looked around at the group who for once had nothing to say back to her. "Well, unless you have questions, it's time to get ready and be mailgirls!"<br><br>When they started to come back out, firstly Jan and Jackson with Annette just behind them, then Pam with Kimiko and Lauryn dragging up the rear, they found Lindsay still waiting for them. "Where's the other one?" she asked no one in particular.<br><br>But even Wendy seemed irked at the boss's manner. "Fanny has the day off," she snapped back.<br><br>Lindsay snorted derisively at that. She concentrated on the mailgirls who were standing behind the chairs. "Did I mention we can see your cunts from our floor when you sit on these?" she snarled.<br><br>"What did you say?" Jackson shot back.<br><br>"Cunts!" Lindsay snarled. And with that she was on her way.<br><br>They were all silent for a moment. Until Pam looked around, trying to read the feelings of the others. "What's wrong with her?" she asked. Of course no one had an answer to that. Or one that they would say out loud.<br><br>Annette perked up after a moment. "Time to take our seats, ladies," she laughed as if it was the best thing ever. As she set herself up in one of the new chairs. "They are actually quite comfortable," she announced, leaning back with her legs spread and her laptop attached to an adjustable monitor arm.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Kimiko was explaining how Mrs Ogawa was far more interested in furthering her own pleasure ahead of sorting out the office, as Mr Harada — and Lindsay Davenport — were both hoping.<br><br>"That could be a good thing for us," Jackson suggested. She was thinking of Mrs Ogawa going completely rogue and playing into the mailgirls' plans.<br><br>"But it's Hell for me," Kimiko reminded her. She had been strung upside down on the mezzanine, displayed nude and restrained in an upmarket bar. Who knew what Mrs Ogawa would think of next.<br><br>"Yes," Jackson admitted, "I should have thought of that."<br><br>Mitch smiled across the table at both of the naked mailgirls, joining their casual chat. "At the risk of mansplaining back to you what you have just worked through, I will go to Lindsay and try to explain to her that the mailgirl contracts are still in place and the Fair Work Commission may impose penalties if it finds that the company is not complying. And I will hint at the headaches she will get with unwanted publicity or consequences. Well, I'll at least try to sound out Lindsay to see how much that bothers her, given the environment that she came from in the States. Where they think they can do anything."<br><br>Jackson nodded, knowing from her chats with Heather what the managers' attitude to mailgirls was there.<br><br>Mitch looked for confirmation from the two mailgirls. Kimiko nodded her acceptance, so he continued. "You know, if word gets out of how the local mailgirls are being treated. Given the conditions and rules we have in place here. I think it's time for the former boss, me — who has no actual power in this — to find what power of persuasion I have left and what I can do. Let's face it, if you go straight in and get involved, Jackson, it's going to be demands and conflict. So give me a chance to try to sort this out nicely. Does that all sound reasonable?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "And I thought I was the negotiator," she laughed.<br><br>"Well, I do have a few skills in the area," Mitch cajoled her back. "Kimiko, are you okay with that?" She nodded. "I'll give it a try. Know that I am looking out for you," he added. Although Mitch was watching her closely, he had no idea what her real feelings were on the matter. But whatever her feelings, Kimiko's nod indicated that the meeting was over, they had got as far as they could.<br><br>Jackson got up from her seat and moved towards the door. She looked to Kimiko who stayed in her seat apparent thinking on something, so Jackson shrugged and left the room. Mitch got up to return from the meeting place to his desk. That was when Kimiko got up. Instead of heading towards the door, she made towards Mitch.<br><br>"Kimiko?" Mitch asked as she stepped into his personal space.<br><br>"Thank you," she whispered, then kissed him on the lips. Kimiko grasped his shoulders with some strength. Mitch looked down into her eyes and saw something new that he had not seen before, something that broke his resolve and opened himself up to her. Kimiko sensed that too. Rather than break the kiss and make it a polite peck of acknowledgment, she moved her tongue to his lips and then inside his mouth. Mitch hugged Kimiko close as he responded, kissing her with a passion that he did not know that he had for mailgirl who had taken up so much of his problem solving skills, his time and diplomacy. This was mad, he knew, but at the moment responding to her passion with his seemed right and good.<br><br>Kimiko let go of Mitch's shoulders and reached down until her hands were on his pants and then at his belt. "No," Mitch gently suggested. She looked at him, hungry, inquiring. But she dropped her hands to her side.<br><br>"Mitch?" she asked, looking straight into his eyes. She placed both hands lightly on his shoulders.<br><br>Mitch hesitated for only a moment as their breath mingled, mouths just centimetres apart. Kimiko heaved with the passion of the moment and Mitch realised how badly he wanted it too. "Not here," he decided. "It's close enough to finishing time. Meet me at my car in fifteen minutes."<br><br>Kimiko brightened up. "My place."<br><br>Mitch felt a further thrill at her invitation. It was so easy. "Yes," he agreed eagerly, "your place."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>And that finishes this season of Mailgirls Down Under. The next season will come later in the year, for those who read them as they are published. Writing these is a lot of fun for me, but I need a short break.<br><br>However, during the break I am planning something I am calling Spotlight Specials. One of them is a long fragment that I could not fit into the timeline but is already written and will form part of the Mailgirls Down Under canon. Another is partly written... well, it involves the twins. Hopefully it will be ready before I start on Part 13.<br><br>To be the first on your block to read these maybe the best thing is to follow me so you get the notification when they are published. Of course I'd love to be able to send a mailgirl around with a message for you when they are ready. But they've hacked the app.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "Who wants to be a mailgirl? The job sounds pretty good.", 
                    content: `Jackson sped up the stairs to the sixth floor and opened the door onto that floor to collect her message. Feeling a bit naughty since she would soon be finished for the week, the naked mailgirl slowed down as she passed in front of the lifts on the off chance someone from outside would get out there since that was management's level, and they were always getting visitors. No such luck for Jackson this time, none of the lifts pinged. She was about to go behind the partition to enter the management suite when another mailgirl came out into the foyer.<br><br>Lauryn Marks, thin and lithe like Jackson, bustled towards her, her body well toned from the sheer physical requirements of the job. Unusually, she looked tense.<br><br>"Everything okay?" Jackson asked her.<br><br>"Just delivered a message to Lindsay." Lauryn frowned. Dealing with Lindsay Davenport, Melbourne's new office manager was stressful for the mailgirls, given Lindsay's overt disdain for them. As boss, she found new ways to interfere with the previously smooth running of the mailgirl program on an almost weekly basis. But that was only part of it. Lauryn reached out to gently touch Jackson's arm. "And there's something else..." she started.<br><br>"Yes?" Jackson reached back, taking Lauryn's hand in hers, lightly gripped the other naked mailgirl. Concerned, she looked into Lauryn's eyes.<br><br>"Can you meet me for a drink after work? Something I need to tell you," Lauryn asked, breaking Jackson's gaze.<br><br>"Of course." Jackson did not hesitate even for an instant.<br><br>Lauryn brightened up a little, pecked her friend on the cheek and gently squeezed her bare hip. She then strode past the lifts to take the stairs back down to the mezzanine. Jackson stood there for a moment, admiring her friend's thin hips and taut butt before she started the other way to find out what Lindsay wanted of her. Then she stopped for a moment. 'What am I becoming,' the naked mailgirl wondered, 'now wanting to show myself off to strangers?' Admitting it was a buzz, she considered a visit to the dildo station on the seventh floor, just one flight above. But first she had to deal with Lindsay.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Kimiko Date stretched out in the passenger seat of Mitchell Johnson's car, then turned towards Mitch, pressing her feet gently against his while he drove. He turned and smiled at her.<br><br>"Do you remember me with clothes on?" she teased. She toyed with the hem of her skirt. Yes, she had dressed before they left the office. The rules. Mailgirls were only naked in the office, during working hours.<br><br>Mitch smiled at his passenger. "No, not really. I didn't have much to do with you when you were in the finance team."<br><br>"That's a shame. I noticed you. But then you were the boss of the whole office." She looked outside. "Take this left here," she instructed. "And there's parking under the complex, so you can be discreet."<br><br>Mitch frowned for a moment. Why had he not even thought of being discreet? He was floating on air, genuinely swept away once it became clear what was going to happen between him and the most outrageous of the mailgirls. Concentrate, he ordered himself, you are driving in traffic. Not far to go now.<br><br>Once inside Kimiko's apartment, with the door closed they made it to the living room before they urgently took up where they had stopped in the office, suddenly they were again passionately kissing each, reaching around shoulders, arms, sides with their hands in a series of urgent embraces.<br><br>Kimiko eased Mitch's arms off her. He looked into her face to see why and she looked assertively straight back at him. "You're not fetishising the hot Asian chick are you?" she enquired.<br><br>Mitch tried to give her the sort of smile that he knew Shane Crawford, the devil-may-care Office Number Two, would radiate in such a situation. "Well, you are certainly hot, sure," he noted and thought for a moment. "But if I'm fetishising anything about you, it's what you have been doing in the office since you became a mailgirl." Kimiko smiled at how seriously Mitch was trying to justify what he was about to do with her.<br><br>Mitch recalled Kimiko's highlights in the office. There were too many incidents. The time she loudly wanked herself during the whole of office meeting. And lately letting Mrs Ogawa bind and suspend her from the ceiling, just for two instances. And here they were, alone. He tried to pretend not, but he almost felt entitled. After all he had fought the temptation of the mailgirls until now. And where had it got him? "It's not a fetish thing," Mitch insisted.<br><br>Kimiko nodded, pretending that it really mattered to her. "Well, that's good." Then she gave him a sly look. "Of course you're allowed to fetishise me. I like that."<br><br>Mitch smiled, relieved. "You like the attention."<br><br>Kimiko put her arms back around the taller man. "Of course I do." They kissed again, a long smooch with real passion, once again gripping each other's body beginning to discover what each of them wanted.<br><br>Again though Kimiko stepped back from Mitch. "I want you," she breathed, "but I want to do this properly." She stepped further away. "Give me a moment," she promised. Mitch nodded as she disappeared from the living room. "I'm in the bedroom getting ready," she called out after a short while.<br><br>"Okay," Mitch responded, prepared for anything since it was Kimiko. And thinking of her antics in the office, he got very turned on.<br><br>After another moment, Kimiko called out "Almost ready!" Then she added "Take off your clothes and come in."<br><br>Mitch shrugged. The cost of wanting to have Kimiko. He took off his clothes, carefully folded them on Kimiko's sofa. "Where are you?" he called out once he was naked. He followed her voice, her calls of 'here' until he stood outside her closed bedroom door. "I'm here," he warned."<br><br>"And I'm here," Kimiko laughed. Mitch opened the door. The light was on. He could see her and she could see him. "Nice," she observed. Mitch stepped towards Kimiko who sat in the middle of a king-size bed, aware that he was completely naked, hiding nothing. She happily noted that he had kept himself in shape and also that he was very erect.<br><br>In contrast Kimiko looked like something from out of Jane Austen in a low cut gown that showed a fair amount of cleavage but also spread down to her feet. Her decolletage clearly revealed that there were at least 2 layers of clothing beneath. Mitch looked at her, bemused.<br><br>Kimiko read Mitch's look. "Yes," she exclaimed, "I am dressed and you are the naked one!" Mitch nodded gentle agreement since that was pretty obvious. He stood and stared at her, wondering what she expected. "Isn't it hot?" Kimiko continued, an enticing look on her face. Then she explained. Mitch had to find his way to her pussy through the clothes, get her wet and then fuck her with all her clothes on. "It's Jane Austen but X-rated, all that lace and bodices but in this version we go all the way," Kimiko challenged, confirming Mitch's expectations.<br><br>With that invitation, Mitch settled on the bed next to object of his attention. Trying to play the Regency card, he reached for Kimiko's hand and raising it to his lips, gently kissed it, calling her 'my lady' then grinning along with Kimiko at the absurdity of him wooing her like that whilst naked and erect.<br><br>Sidling close to Kimiko, Mitch ran his hand down her body, along her skirts from her thigh, down her leg, to her foot and her toes which in the manner of those times were hidden from his view under her sumptuous skirts. Mitch lifted the gown a little revealing one unclothed foot. "Your ankle is bare," Mitch gasped in mock horror. Kimiko laughed, so Mitch reached further to try to make sense of the outfit she had on. He found her leg was bare for a distance under her petticoats. He reached further up then struck more material. "A third layer?" Mitch smiled, "what's that one called?"<br><br>Kimiko leaned close to him to whisper in his ear. "I have no idea."<br><br>But it was only a short step further up for Mitch's hand to reach Kimiko's bare inner thigh. He ventured further, his fingers now between her thighs, then easily through her open drawers, finding no resistance. "You're already wet!" Mitch exclaimed. His next task was redundant.<br><br>Kimiko gently licked Mitch's neck. "Of course I'm wet," she breathed into his ear. And with that she pushed Mitch onto his back on the bed then hefted her skirts so that she could settle herself onto Mitch, embedding him in her. And like that, they were fucking, with Kimiko's skirts spread around where they were secretly joined.<br><br>For a moment, Mitch felt some doubt. 'What am I doing here,' he wondered. But that soon passed with the warmth of their bodies pressed together. As Mitch thrust into Kimiko, he felt that he was in some sort of heaven. Looking up at Kimiko, he got the idea that she was too. Perfectly united they continued, Mitch reaching all her right spots, both of them finding easily how to please the other. Kimiko tensed as she got close, crying out "Yes, yes!!" as Mitch enjoyed Kimiko's loud orgasm. Shortly after Mitch came too.<br><br>They lay next to each other on her bed gently caressing the other, holding each other's satisfied gaze. Eventually Mitch spoke up. "That was..." he started. "And now..." he wondered.<br><br>Kimiko looked carefully at her lover. And realised that he needed reassurance. "Mitch, you've seen me since I started as a mailgirl. You can see that I am my own person. I get what I want. And this is great. But don't worry, I'm not going to make any demands of you. That's just not me." Mitch nodded.<br><br>They lay there for a few more moments. Mitch looked at his watch. "I have to go."<br><br>Kimiko turned to him with a controlling smile. "Not yet," she announced.<br><br>Mitch shook his head solemnly. "No, I really have to go," he told her.<br><br>Kimiko bent over and took his limp cock in her mouth. She sucked him, up and down a few times. He started to rise. Kimiko looked up at him. "And now?" she asked slyly.<br><br>Mitch exhaled, gave in to the inevitable. "Well, in a few moments," he conceded. Not fighting at all against the resumption of their tryst,<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lauryn and Jackson sat across from each other toying with their forks at the large pasta dishes in front of them.<br><br>"Here we are with clothes on," Lauryn noted.<br><br>Jackson smiled. "I know it's been great catching up on everything here, just the two of us, away from the office. But you've avoided telling me what you wanted to speak about." They had their connection — Jackson could chide Lauryn like that without causing offence.<br><br>Lauryn looked down, as if concentrating only on her food. Knowing that the time had come, she would have to say it. "I've quit."<br><br>"Lauryn!" Jackson cried out, with real concern.<br><br>They stared, silent for a moment. Finally Lauryn relaxed a little and looked up at her friend. "It's all good," she insisted, "I've got a similar role — to what I used to do..."<br><br>"How? Why?" Jackson exclaimed, although there seemed to be pretty evident answers to both of those questions.<br><br>Lauryn gave Jackson a shy smile. "Mitch gave me a good reference signed as Manager of Special Projects. He mentioned my project work on the $4 billion recycling scheme. Which was nice of him, given the history of that."<br><br>"Yes, they ignored the work you did on that when you had your clothes on," Jackson remembered. "And took it seriously when you were a mailgirl." Jackson smiled, realising that it was good. "And the new company?" she asked.<br><br>"Doesn't come into it. They don't have to know everything I have been doing."<br><br>"And they won't," Jackson agreed.<br><br>"My passion is BA work." Lauryn smirked at the incongruity of that given her time as a mailgirl.<br><br>"Okay," Jackson replied cautiously.<br><br>Lauryn sensed her concern "Come on, your passion is employment regulations."<br><br>Jackson ignored that. "I'll miss you."<br><br>Lauryn nodded. "Me too."<br><br>Jackson had to smile. "What else will you miss?"<br><br>They both smirked. Were they both thinking about the free orgasms in the office?<br><br>Lauryn looked straight at Jackson, an odd look on her face. "Will you take me home?" she asked. Jackson stared at her, startled. "For old times' sake?" Lauryn pleaded.<br><br>Jackson smiled, reaching across the table to take her friend's hand in hers. "Well, in that case..."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Finally alone, Mitch drove home from Kimiko's. He looked over at the empty seat where the mailgirl he had just fucked had sat while he had driven her from the office to their assignation. He felt strange about finally crossing that barrier. Especially given all the demands that the mailgirls had made of him, particularly since he had ceased to run the office. He thought of the times he had wanked Jackson for her pleasure with, he silently noted, no reward for him. Nothing from any of them. Until now.<br><br>Mitch thought of Mr Harada's demands — well, the company owner had virtually demanded that Mitch sleep with the mailgirls. Which was one reason why he had held back. Why should he do a thing that he did not want to do, something of that enormity just to please his boss? And now that he had finally succumbed, what had he done? He knew what he had done. He had fucked the owner's grand-daughter.<br><br>He thought of his wife as he drove back to her. And how he was content, more than content with Jessica. She was all that he wanted. Was. Until Kimiko looked at him in that way when they were suddenly alone. And like that, just one look and all his defences, all the reasons not to, had vanished. So that fucking Kimiko on her bed like that was an absolutely sensible thing to do.<br><br>Mitch turned onto his street. And a certain trepidation crept up on him. He slowed the car as he rationalised it. Was what he had just done with Kimiko that much different from having his fingers and tongue inside Jackson? And what he had down with the others? He remembered Shane's insouciance when Mitch had caught him fucking Heather. Well, if Shane could manage it...<br><br>Mitch stepped inside his house. All was silent. And dark. He went to their bedroom. There was a note on the wardrobe door: 'Girls are out. Games room,' was all it said.<br><br>Mitch now felt worried as he stripped, knowing Jessica expected that of him. He eased down the hall towards their playroom at the back of the silent house. Before he opened the door he noticed a dim light was on in there. When he opened the door the crisp opening of Prokofiev's Dance of the Knights warned him that Jessica was in wait and that he was in for some attention. That tune was one of their signals. His wife stood in the semi-dark in her black thigh boots and what seemed like a bondage black bikini. She meant business.<br><br>"Where have you been?" Jessica asked sharply.<br><br>Mitch took a step into the room. "Mailgirl duties," he told her, not inaccurately.<br><br>"Mailgirl duties," Jessica sneered back. She did not need to tell her husband what time it was. And that mailgirl duties finished at five o'clock. They both knew that. Whatever his mailgirl duties may be now, since he no longer ran the office. They both knew that she had good reason to sneer. And after those two words, she stayed silent.<br><br>Clearly the next move was up to Mitch. He stammered out an explanation. "I've been giving the mailgirls support. They're under attack from Lindsay. And they come to me, sort of as a safe haven and for advice..."<br><br>"Safety and advice," Jessica mocked. "Which ones?"<br><br>"All of them... Jackson, Annette, Pam, Kimiko..."<br><br>"And what services do you offer them?"<br><br>"I talk to them... Kimiko came up to see me, needing some comfort..."<br><br>"And you gave her comfort?" Mitch looked down at the floor. Jessica leapt on that. She realised. "Not Jackson then? I always assumed it would be her. I thought she was your favourite?" Her wide-eyed stare drew a silent admission from her husband. "Your fickle affections have shifted," she sniffed, "and you couldn't help but be a shoulder for a naked girl to lean on." Mitch chose to say nothing. "Let's consider what to do with you. Since you have been a bad mailboy," Jessica continued.<br><br>Mitch felt the urge to try to find out directly how upset Jessica was. It was hard for him to tell, was she treating it as a joke? Before now in their games they had taunted each other about the prospect. But then it was a game. This was real. And Jessica held all the cards.<br><br>"On your knees mailboy!" Jessica suddenly ordered, breaking into Mitch's anxious thoughts. In his role as naked mailboy he obeyed, coming right up close to where his wife stood and then kneeling in that mailboy position, with his back straight which meant that his cock stuck out prominently in front of him. He was so hard, even after what Kimiko had put him through. Jessica reached down with a gloved hand to physically confirm that Mitch was in fact turned on. "What is going on with this?" she sneered, holding his cock disdainfully. "Haven't you already done enough with this already today?"<br><br>"Uhh," started Mitch before deciding that it may not be a good idea to say anything.<br><br>Of course Jessica was not going to let go either of her husband's cock which she still held between two gloved fingers, nor of the issue of what he had been doing with it earlier in the evening. "Are you getting turned on thinking that you can have your way with one of your mailgirls and then come home to your steamy and horny wife and repeat your performance with her?" Mitch held his tongue. So Jessica continued. "I think you are. I think you think that you can do whatever you want to whoever you want and then come home and everything will be all right."<br><br>Jessica grabbed her man by the back of his head forcing his face into her crotch. To his relief he found that she was already very wet as he worked into her slit with his tongue. Not that he had much choice in that matter. Jessica continued her banter. "So you finally succumbed? And it wasn't even to your talisman Jackson. Imagine her alone at home all by herself now after a day of trying to please you, again failing to get you to finally take her. All those meetings with you, her there naked and willing and you all buttoned up..."<br><br>"Um..." grunted Mitch into his wife's throbbing pussy. She was getting off on the trash talking. And she was not yet finished. "So the first time this other mailgirl flutters her eyelashes and throws her naked body at you, you forget about your wife... forget about your loyal mailgirl..." For some reason that was too much. It pushed Jessica over the edge. She let out a huge moan, pushing herself into Mitch's tongue as he kept up his work.<br><br>As her orgasm subsided, Mitch reached for his cock. But Jessica reacted straight away. "There'll be none of that for you," she snapped pulling his hand away from what he was going to do about his erection. "There is going to be some evening up of the score before that is allowed," she threatened. Mitch squatted there, erect but unstimulated as Jessica stood a step back to consider what to do next.<br><br>She decided to do nothing. Rather she would wait to see what Mitch would attempt. They were silent for a while.<br><br>"So..." Mitch started, breaking their silence.<br><br>Jessica butted in before he could say any more. "I guess I've been expecting it," she stated. "Sooner or later. I mean you're a man, the weaker vessel. And you do have these attractive naked women trying to impress you all day."<br><br>Mitch felt relief. Maybe Jessica did see even this as a game. Was she enjoying this? Rather than angry, was she enlivened?<br><br>"I am almost impressed that you held back from them so long. But I guess you have rationalised it as a sense of duty. Of course whether that is to Jackson or me. That is the question." Jessica picked up her riding crop from the sideboard. She swished it playfully near her husband, careful to not actually make contact with him. "Well, I think I would like to meet this Kimiko. Get her dimensions. See what sort of threat she is."<br><br>Mitch loosened up. "Sure, if I can convince her to come," he answered.<br><br>Jessica swished her whip around. "What will it take to convince her?" she posed.<br><br>Mitch thought he should try humour. "Well, I guess she will need some assurance that you won't boil her pet bunny."<br><br>Jessica gave him a dangerous smile. "If she does have a pet bunny I just might."<br><br>Mitch smiled at the thought of Jessica inviting Kimiko around, cooking a meal for her, and sitting down convivially with her, bunny or no bunny. "Well, good luck with that," he suggested.<br><br>He read his wife's reaction and shuddered. It seemed very much that she indeed did intend to meet Kimiko. And size her up. Jessica swished the riding crop slightly closer to her husband's cock.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>June Lockhart put aside her HR work and stood up from her desk attracting the attention of her colleague across the desk, Martin Plaza. "I have a meeting with Mitch," June advised as she stepped away to leave their office.<br><br>"Looking for another job?" Martin replied pretty much automatically. He did not see the flash of alarm across June's face in response. What did he know?<br><br>"You'll be the second person to know," she joked regaining her composure. She turned and headed for the exit.<br><br>Since Mitch's office was on the tenth floor, one flight up, June chose to take the stairs. Opening the door into the staircase, June found she was chest to chest with one of the mailgirls who had been coming down. The naked woman's breasts were a breath away from hers. What was her name, June worried, as she stepped back from the tall thin athlete who appeared to be in a hurry. June could not remember. Still, the mailgirl stopped for a moment to smile an apology to her.<br><br>"Sorry," Jan Stephenson puffed, "under the new rules, I have to beat the clock. Delivery on the sixth." Not getting a response from June, she smiled, stepped aside and went on her way, another three flights down. Was that what she was going to become, June wondered. Well, at least she could do with the exercise. She took the steps up to the next floor trying not to puff herself out and wondering how she would feel doing it nude.<br><br>June knocked on Mitch's office door then went in. Mitch looked up, clearly she had distracted him from something. Although she quickly realised that he seemed happy for her to do that.<br><br>"Thanks for seeing me, Mitch," June started as she sat demurely across from him.<br><br>"Always have the time," Mitch responded. Which he grudgingly admitted, was the truth. Such a change, one that he still had not accepted. Waiting for projects, some which never arrived. He realised that June had become serious, her features tense as she gripped the armrests of her seat.<br><br>She bit her lip and then came out with it. "I've been thinking about mailgirls, Mitch."<br><br>Mitch was still preoccupied with his own issues and did not fully get her. "Haven't we all?" he joked. Then he looked at her, realised. "Oh. Sorry. That must have sounded terrible." Now he focussed. "I would have said it was a bit deal a while ago. To think about your career and all that. But that is not how it seems to have turned out, at least so far." June nodded. "You know about the pay. And you're in HR, so I guess you have an idea of the contracts and the conditions. Perhaps we are more enlightened as a society than I thought."<br><br>"You mean acceptance?"<br><br>Mitch nodded. "You know about the mailgirls here. We specifically decided not to go for cheerleaders, as they do in The States."<br><br>"Is that a way of saying that I am not attractive?" June felt rude as soon as she said it. But she should not have worried.<br><br>"No, I mean there are not same expectations on the mailgirls here." Mitch got a beep on his phone. He looked, shook his head, then gave June a boyish smile. "This wasn't planned, but Shane has sent a mailgirl to find me with a message. That won't be a problem, will it? I mean you can ask her..."<br><br>June smiled back at Mitch. "That's fine." If she was thinking about becoming one, she ought to be able to talk to them, more than just an embarrassed silence in the stairwell, she reasoned.<br><br>"Are there any other questions before..." Mitch asked June. But it was too late.<br><br>Annette Kellerman came through the open door. "Hi Mitch," she started, "Shane asked me to..." Then she realised Mitch had company. She squared her shoulders and so thrust out her tight bust, standing there with her legs just far enough apart. "Bad time?" she asked, hands on her hips.<br><br>"No," Mitch insisted, "In fact a good time. June here has some questions for you." Annette smiled at June who tried to remain composed.<br><br>"You're not a journalist?" Annette asked, breaking her pose to slink up next to her. As was the habit of all the mailgirls with someone interested in them she stood right near June, placing a hand on the armrest of her chair. June realised that she had clenched her hands together in her lap.<br><br>She turned to the mailgirl finding her face close to Annette's firm breasts. Were all the mailgirls athletic specimens, she privately worried. "No," she replied, "I'm in HR."<br><br>Annette took a step away. "That's worse!" she exclaimed. Then she gave June a wide smile. And she stepped forward, placing an arm on June's shoulder, meaning that June had to swivel her seat to face the naked woman who seemed to be controlling the discussion. Annette read her face. "You're not thinking of becoming one of us?" she demanded.<br><br>"Well, maybe... I was wondering..." June responded weakly.<br><br>Matter-of-factly, Annette ran her fingers up June's arm while looking her over from her close range. Annette smiled. "Why don't you strip?" she urged.<br><br>June recoiled and splurted an obvious rejoinder. "Me? Now?"<br><br>Annette leaned down to give June her full attention, breasts lightly swinging. "Being a mailgirl does mean taking your clothes off." She leant a little closer. "Didn't you realise?" she teased.<br><br>Annette stepped back to give June some room to breathe and to think. "Umm," she replied. That broke some ice. They all laughed. June looked over to Mitch to gauge his thoughts.<br><br>Mitch smiled warmly. "I look at naked mailgirls everyday."<br><br>June sat up straight. "It's a big deal for me..." she argued.<br><br>Annette would not buy that. "It's not a big deal for me," she retorted.<br><br>June was curious. "But you look so relaxed about it."<br><br>Annette stood there, spreading her legs a little further, placing a finger at her opening, knowing that June was mesmerised and couldn't look away. "If I wasn't into it, I wouldn't be here like this," Annette pointed out. As the tip of her finger disappeared. Speechless, June managed to look at Mitch. She realised from his nonchalant reaction that indeed having naked women in his office was apparently no big deal. As he said, he looked at naked mailgirls all day. And apparently he was relaxed about them fingering themselves in front of him.<br><br>Annette worked that finger across her clit and traced her free hand over June's shoulder. "You want to be a mailgirl," she breathed into June's ear.<br><br>Maybe that was the permission June needed. She looked hopefully to Annette then untucked her blouse from the waistband of her skirt and began to unbutton it. Annette stepped away to slouch against Mitch's desk which gave June the room that she needed. She looked across the desk to Mitch who was trying to look non-committal. So she undid the rest of the buttons. She stopped and looked back over to Annette. "What was the first time you stripped off like?" she asked a bit clumsily.<br><br>Annette scratched at one of her breasts. "It was a long time ago in a kingdom far, far away," she mused.<br><br>June had stopped undressing. "Er," she replied to Annette.<br><br>For some reason Annette was not feeling any need to be supportive. Leaning back against the desk, she spread her legs so she could trace a finger along her slit and then, what the Hell, insert it for a moment before adding another finger while making sure that June was watching her. June had paused her undressing, her blouse untidily back over her shoulders, her bra still covering her breasts. Stopping her wanking Annette leaned forward towards her quarry. "Well... Do you want a hand to finish the job?" Annette offered, fully aware of course of where that hand currently was. "And you'll find it will be easier from here if you stand up. Speaking from experience," she added.<br><br>June looked over to Mitch who still maintained his air of having women naked in his office was totally normal these days. She stood up, carefully stepping away from Annette and eased the blouse off, folding it on her vacated chair. Annette stopped her fiddling and along with Mitch watched June who now faced removing something more revealing, either her bra or her skirt.<br><br>She chose the skirt. She slid it down over her thighs and off. Now only in her conventional bra and panties she felt pudgy, outclassed by Annette's lithe body and shamelessness. Sensing no other option, she unhooked her bra freeing her modest but perky breasts. And then the pants dropped to the floor. She stood there, unsure for a moment.<br><br>"Not bad," Annette declared. Mitch wisely said nothing. June looked to Annette, quite unsure what to do now. Annette realised, raising her eyebrows at the thought. "Mailgirls have to deliver the mail," Annette continued. "I have a message for you," she beckoned.<br><br>Still quite stiff, June stepped towards the actual mailgirl. Annette reached towards her, pretend handing June a message which June pretend accepted. "Can you find Mitch and see if he is free?" Annette asked.<br><br>June stepped away from Annette and with a little more confidence she went over to face Mitch across his desk. "I have a message for you," she started robotically. But she noted that Mitch was staring at her face, so she loosened a bit as she repeated the message to him.<br><br>Mitch smiled encouragingly. "See. You can do it, if that's what you want," he responded.<br><br>June suddenly found herself blushing. Why, she wondered. Of course. She got suddenly self-conscious, standing naked in a room in her office with two of her colleagues, play-acting to see if she could work there naked every day. She was trying to process that, this exposure was private. Could she actually do it, move throughout the office with everything on display?<br><br>"Can you take this reply message to Annette?" Mitch asked, breaking into her into her thoughts.<br><br>June reacted as she believed Mitch expected. She stood facing him, bare naked and even spread her legs a bit. Which strange to her, felt like freedom. Maybe she was starting to understand, she wondered, as she took the imaginary reply from Mitch. She went close to Annette to give her Mitch's reply, but avoided any physical contact with the actual mailgirl. That would be too much. After an awkward moment, June apologised. "I think I'd like to get dressed now if that's okay," she faltered.<br><br>Annette smiled warmly at June. "No one is forcing you to do anything," she reminded her.<br><br>"Yes, but if I agreed to do it I wouldn't have any other choice," June replied as she quickly dressed herself.<br><br>Annette decided to go for broke. "Did you like it?" she asked.<br><br>"I was too nervous, I think," June admitted. But she did not say that now she was back in her clothes her body, particularly her pussy, was tingling like mad with the recollected thrill of what she had just done. She tried to hide it. She did not do a good job. She stood there gripping the back of her chair as if she could not be responsible if her hands became free.<br><br>Annette smiled at her like she knew exactly what was going on. Which she obviously had a lot of experience herself. "Being a mailgirl gives you a lot of freedom, if you know what I mean." she told June who nodded along. The sensation grew. Plus she relived the attention the mailgirls had shown her. And Annette was now suggesting she could do that to others. "And there's the other thing," Annette smiled as one of her hands started to wander down her belly. "I guess you know what we can do if we get horny."<br><br>"I have some idea..." June stammered.<br><br>Annette was again stroking her clit. "Like now," she gasped at June. Seeing the other woman strip and play the role had pushed her further into that need. She turned to the man behind the desk. "Mitch, do you mind? Unless it's an exclusive service for Jackson?" she teased.<br><br>Mitch knew that he was no longer an exclusive service. But, he reasoned, Annette did not know that yet. So he acted like it was a big deal for him. Even though he had not given her his clear assent, Annette got up and went around to his side of the desk. She sat on his desk facing him and spread her legs.<br><br>"Work your magic please Mitch," she insisted. And he did. June stood there watching, still holding that chair. And she wondered if she was permitted to join the club, whether it was allowed for her to get the relief that Mitch was giving Annette there, right in front of her. Or whether she would baulk when it was her turn.<br><br>Annette came loudly. Was she putting on a show for June? If so, she avoided looking at June, any interaction that could give the other woman a hint. She clenched her eyes closed as Mitch finished her off. Eventually she let Mitch sit back. She then stood up and flicked her hair back out of her eyes. And she became the delivery service she was paid to be. "Oh yeah Mitch," she advised calmly, "Shane wanted to make sure that you have your footy tips in. And if you need some help, I'll share mine with you."<br><br>Annette looked over to June with a sparkle in her eyes. "Are you shocked?" Annette asked the other woman as she absently rubbed her pussy, which apparently still needed attention despite — or maybe because of — Mitch's good works. "Do you want this too?" Annette asked June and then smiled over at Mitch. "I'm sure he would be happy to help you out."<br><br>June suddenly regained a little of her senses. "Are there actually any vacancies for mailgirls at the moment?" she asked. She would just have deal with her needs later. That was just too far for her after everything else.<br><br>Mitch smiled enigmatically. "I hear that there might be," he responded. Annette looked at him, surprised that he would say such a thing. Sure he was their Mitch. But he was no longer the boss, and tucked away in his special projects corner here, what did he know, was it something that she didn't? But Mitch smiled back at Annette, happy for June to understand a look that said clearly that he knew what he was talking about. And that he was not going to say anything more.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jan strode into the mezzanine where the other mailgirls were waiting. Annette and Pam Burridge were standing close, ready to swoop on Jan while Lauryn sat in a display chair, working at something on her laptop. Jan set down the hamper she carried and shucked off her jacket. "Not bad, girl," Annette remarked as she fingered the fabric of Jan's miniskirt which showed off her long legs to definite advantage. Annette was of course nude. Or in other words, Jan was currently a clothed mailgirl. Annette could not resist playing with the buttons of Jan's loose blouse. The outfit hinted at the athleticism of Jan's tight body. Pam stepped over and while Annette reached under Jan's miniskirt to feel up the top of her thighs, Pam fingered Jan's nipples through her thin cotton blouse.<br><br>"Girls!" Jan gasped.<br><br>"Jan," Wendy Turnbull called out from behind her desk, like she was responsible for the other two's behaviour. They stopped their assault while Jan looked over to see Wendy, the mailgirls' supervisor, tapping at her watch. Jan smiled sweetly at Wendy and quickly unbuttoned her blouse and then shimmied out of her skirt. Then flicked off her high heels. She was again naked, a mailgirl. Annette gave her a chaste peck on the cheek. And Jackson walked in smiling when she saw their lunch had indeed arrived. Jan folded her clothes to place in her locker until home time.<br><br>"Thank God," Pam exclaimed as she checked through the hamper. It was Jan's turn to buy their lunches. Pam located hers. "We thought you had gone over to the other side!" Pam laughed. Annette sniggered. It was a joke that they rarely made about the lunch roster. But why not this time?<br><br>Jackson looked over to Lauryn in her chair who chose to look away and avoid the group mirth. Both Jackson and her knew that Lauryn was counting down the days. She had admitted to Jackson that she was finding it hard to get to tell the others. The now naked Jan collected her own lunch out of the hamper and sat back in her display seat, her legs spread, everything on display. Her re-transformation was complete.<br><br>"Did anyone notice?" Pam asked Jan.<br><br>"You mean about the lack of underwear?" Jan checked. She shook her head like it did not matter.<br><br>"I always wear mine," Pam admitted. "Obviously I should dare..."<br><br>Monika Mayhem rushed in, aware that she was late for the start of their lunch break. Annette extracted Monika's lunch order then looked over and smiled at the newest starter. "Where have you been?" she asked Monika as she handed it over.<br><br>"Making the coffee for an HR meeting that overran," Monika explained.<br><br>"Yes, that happens," Pam agreed. "Anything interesting happen there?"<br><br>"Budgets and things like that," Monika recounted as the others in the room stopped to hear if she had any news. "Sorry," she admitted, "that's not my thing. I sort of glazed over when they started talking numbers and kind of just looked after their coffee needs on autopilot. Comes from working in a cafe for too long. Sorry." No one seemed too upset at her lack of intel. You either got it or you didn't. But Monika looked over to Pam who was sitting next to her. "You know, they didn't look at me or even talk to me for their orders. I just wandered around and poured. Am I the only one is invisible to them? I mean I am a tallish naked woman and the staff in the meeting barely looked at me."<br><br>"Sorry," Pam, the former model replied, "that's not a problem I have."<br><br>"I mean look at me," Monika continued, "I have the tits, I have this thing down here," gesturing at her trimmed bush and what lay below, what is the problem?"<br><br>"Maybe you need to brush up on your presentation skills," Annette offered.<br><br>Monika turned to her. "Really? All this stuff is not enough?" She was still promoting her largish tits and the fact that she was shaved below the bush making her lips appear quite prominent.<br><br>Kimiko sauntered into the room with a smile on her face. Annette noticed. "Kimiko, that's unusual? You're looking rather chipper today."<br><br>Kimiko seemed confused by the term. "Chipper?" Or maybe she was just distracted and not paying full attention.<br><br>Annette was not going to let that go. "Happy, carefree. Are you in love or something?"<br><br>Kimiko looked over at Annette, wide eyed. "Is it that bad?" she asked, pretending that her English comprehension was poor. Now she was playing up to them. Since they all knew that it wasn't.<br><br>Pam spoke up. "Kimiko, Monika needs some help with her presence. The fabrics haven't been noticing her."<br><br>At that moment Mrs Ogawa walked in, her usual stern manner. She strode over to a strong rope that hung from the ceiling. "Kimiko," she ordered, "come over here please." Kimiko showed no reactions as she went over to see what the visiting enforcer from Japan wanted of her. Mrs Ogawa held the rope which was looped through a pulley fixed to the roof. Naked of course, Kimiko stood facing her antagonist, passive, with her hands behind her back as the stern, leather-clad Mrs Ogawa wound the rope around the mailgirl's feet, then around her waist and bound Kimiko's wrists with the rest. While Kimiko stayed quiet and still, managing to avoid any eye contact with her tormentor.<br><br>Mrs Ogawa seemed to not care about Kimiko's non-response to her. Instead, she nodded over at Jan and Pam who came over to hold Kimiko by the arms while Mrs Ogawa tugged the rope until Kimiko was hanging upside down from the roof.<br><br>The experienced mailgirls stayed silent. Monika, surprised, gasped. Pam looked over at her with an 'I'm helpless to deal with this' look as she sat back down. Monika remained shocked. But she decided to brave it. "Is this how I am supposed to attract people's attention?" she tried.<br><br>Annette laughed, a little. "Oh no, one day she's going to be running the company. That's her practice."<br><br>Monika turn back to Pam. "Interesting perspective," she suggested not sure at all what any of it was about.<br><br>Pam smiled back at Monika. "Kimiko's or Annette's?" she asked.<br><br>But with Kimiko suspended upside down for no reason that the other mailgirls knew of, they took their places on their display seats to finish their lunch. Mrs Ogawa crossed her arms and stared at them hoping that they had got her message.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily Johnson knocked on her twin sister's door then went straight in. She unloaded her worries immediately. "Cara, this must be serious. Family meeting? What the Hell is that? Do you know anything?"<br><br>Cara smiled. "I have no idea. We'll just have to wait and find out."<br><br>Emily nodded. "Feeling ready for some shocks? I'm getting sense that something is going on between them." She smiled dangerously at her sister.<br><br>Cara looked worried. "Do you think they found out?"<br><br>"About our mailgirl thing?" She shook her head. "I'm sure there would have been a quiet word from Mum if that was it."<br><br>Cara smiled and nodded. "I think you're right." She looked at her watch. "It's time. Let's go."<br><br>They walked out to the dining room where their parents sat silently facing each other across the table. So far they were not giving any hint to their daughters. Emily took the head of the table. Sizing up the situation and choosing not to sit next to either Jessica or Mitch and seemingly appear to be on one parent's side Cara sat a little away at the other end of the table facing Emily.<br><br>Emily decided to start things off "Do I have referee between you two or something?" she asked.<br><br>Jessica spoke up. "I hope not." She looked straight at Mitch rather than at either of their children. She addressed them while staring at Mitch. "Girls, you're old enough to be a part of this. Your father has been unfaithful and I am deciding what to do about it."<br><br>Neither of the twins displayed any visible emotion about the revelation. What did Jessica expect? Emily looked to her sister, gave her a slight nod.<br><br>Cara smiled at the thought. "Is it a mailgirl?" she asked. Mitch looked to Jessica like this family gathering was her idea, so she needed to deal with the daughters. Neither parent said anything.<br><br>"Well, that explains a lot," Emily decided. They all looked at her. "Well, that's why dad wouldn't let me become a mailgirl." She feigned horror. "Who knows what could have happened?"<br><br>Cara decided to cool that down. "Which one?" she asked her parents.<br><br>Jessica looked at her. "Does it matter?"<br><br>Cara thought about that. "Well, it might. But why did you call us here if you weren't going to be totally open about things?"<br><br>Emily leapt over the top of that. "Well, if he's going to be around naked women all day..."<br><br>Cara agreed. "Yep, you're right. You know what men are like in that sort of situation..." Mitch tried to follow his daughters' reactions. He decided that the best thing to do was to keep silent.<br><br>Jessica did not try to bring Mitch into the conversation. Rather, she tried to look sternly at both daughters at the same time. "Is this some modern thing? You don't seem very concerned about your father's behaviour?"<br><br>Emily looked to Cara then replied to that. "We're getting our cues from you. Neither of you seem too fussed by it. I mean, Dad, you're just sitting there like, I don't know, you forgot to put the rubbish out. And Mum, you haven't thrown anything at him."<br><br>Mitch looked blank. He sat there waiting for something from the women at the table.<br><br>Emily looked over to Cara who nodded back, so Emily stood up. "I think we've seen enough!" she exclaimed. Cara slid along her seat so that as Emily started out of the room, Cara could catch her up and leave with her.<br><br>"Parents!" Cara exclaimed, with energy equal to her twin. "Don't ask us to sort you out. You two do it." And they left.<br><br>The twins trudged into Emily's room. "God, that was weird," Emily complained to her twin. "I need to unwind." Cara smiled knowing what would come next. Sure enough Emily unbuttoned her shirt, shucked off her bra, dropped her pants and so suddenly stood naked in front of her nonchalant sister who faced her with her arms crossed.<br><br>"Tiptoes," ordered Cara gently. Emily complied, standing straight and reaching her hands together above her head. "I'm going to count to twenty," Cara smiled. And she started counting with no urgency, just holding a grin on her face as she stared into her sister's eyes watching Emily start to strain as Cara's count got close to the promised target.<br><br>"God, I needed that," Emily gasped as Cara reached twenty so that she could relax down. She shook out her arms and legs for a moment. "When I do that, I can't do anything but concentrate on the strain in my calves," she reported.<br><br>Cara nodded. "Kneeling now," she ordered before her naked sister could totally relax.<br><br>Emily got into her mailgirl kneeling stance, her knees spread, balancing on her toes with her back straight, breasts thrust forward with her shoulders rolled behind to push her bust out just that little more. Cara stood over her. "Now what can I do?" she wondered. "I don't have anything on hand for a bit of correction." She scratched her chin thinking and then decided with a dangerous smile. And without warning she grabbed one of her sister's breasts and slapped her hand tangentially across the protruding nipple. She was good at that. There was no sound but Emily flinched with the pain and the surprise. Cara made to grab at the other breast when they heard a gentle knock on the door.<br><br>"Girls," Jessica called. They knew what would happen next. "It's mum," came the voice from behind the door. Jessica opened the door and looked in. And then she walked in. It took her a moment to adjust to the scene in front of her.<br><br>Emily lay in her bed on her back with the covers pulled up to her neck. Cara sat uncomfortably on a lower corner of the bed giving her sister a look of concern.<br><br>Jessica stopped a few steps into the room not knowing what to do or say to her children.<br><br>"I'm excessively diverted," Emily cried out, "I don't know if I'll ever be able to get out my bed again! What is to become of us?" Cara reached over as if to soothe her sister's angst.<br><br>"Nobody is on my side," their mother exploded, "nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used."<br><br>"Nobody feels for my poor nerves," Emily complained. Under the covers, she pushed a bare foot against Cara's thigh.<br><br>"You should be on the stage," Jessica snapped back, reverting to her normal self. She missed the quick look of concern that Emily and Cara shared over that. Did their mother know?<br><br>Cara turned to Jessica. "What are you going to do about Dad then? Are we to be ruined?"<br><br>Jessica stepped back to close the door behind her, giving them a sense of confidentiality. Then she came forward. "I'm not going to do anything," she confided.<br><br>"But what Dad did?" Emily started. Cara squeezed her sister's thigh.<br><br>"The weaker vessel," Cara explained to her sister. "So mum is going to forgive him this lapse. "Which means that your life is not ruined and you will still have prospects and money. You will not be a burden to your parents..."<br><br>"I don't know about that," Jessica wondered, getting into the vibe. Then she switched again. "Your father and I are going to work this out within our marriage. I need you two to not be judgemental or take sides. Because this is not a war. Agreed?" The two of them nodded enough to please Jessica who backed out of the room, closing the door behind her.<br><br>Cara pulled the covers off her sister. "You had your hand between your legs the whole time?" she exclaimed, shaking her head in wonder.<br><br>"Well, what would you do?" Emily demanded as she sat up. "God that was close," she laughed. "Me trapped under here with stinging nipples and a sodden pussy." She rubbed her breasts to try to soften them. Then she reached down to her clit for a bit of relief there.<br><br>Cara let go of the covers and stood up over her sister who was now happily getting herself off. "Is that out of Jane Austen too?" Cara snarked.<br><br>"Yep," Emily smiled, spreading her legs wider, "it's from Vag and Vagability."<br><br>Cara shook her head and stood there watching her sister cum.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson was last to arrive at the restaurant and had barely sat down when her friends started on her.<br><br>Samantha made sure that Jackson had her focus. "No secrets!" she ordered her.<br><br>"But I've always kept secrets from you," Jackson complained.<br><br>Charlotte picked her up on that. "It's time to stop. How long have we known each other?"<br><br>Jackson looked around the restaurant to ensure that she had some privacy. Then she leaned forward across the table towards her three friends. She took a deep breath. Then she just let it all out. Told them what she did at Harada Industries. Which made them speechless. So she explained. "There's nothing to it. I go to work each day. I take my clothes off and deliver messages around the office. At the end of the day, I put my clothes back on and go home." She sat back to let her friends digest her news.<br><br>Carrie was the first to think of something to say. "Somehow I thought there would be more to it than that?" she asked, trying to look adult about it.<br><br>Samantha took over from that before Jackson could respond. "There is. I mean all those men and women. Do they look at you?"<br><br>Charlotte smiled. She had another angle. "More to the point, do they do anything to you?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson, feeling a sense of relief that she had got her secret out, toyed with them. "Do anything?" she mocked.<br><br>Samantha decided she needed to be the sensible one. "For fucks sake, you're naked in there. Are you going to tell me there's no sex?"<br><br>"And none of that unwanted stuff..." Carrie added.<br><br>Charlotte looked askance at Carrie. But she was thinking the same thing. "How do you deal with the unwanted stuff?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "It's a workplace. There are rules. And we have to be shown respect at all times."<br><br>"But you're naked," Carrie reminded her, showing some disbelief. She was having trouble with the concept. She told Jackson this. "I just cannot fathom being naked in an office in the city for eight hours a day, getting paid for it, and now you tell me that's what you do and they have to show you respect..."<br><br>Jackson took a breath. "Give me a moment to explain. What was my job before this?"<br><br>Of course that they knew. Jackson fighting the good fight on behalf of the city's sex workers. Going the extra mile, working the necessary odd hours. And enforcing protections and better conditions. Reflecting on that, Charlotte smiled in admiration. "You were amazing."<br><br>"No, I'm normal," Jackson complained.<br><br>Samantha shook her head. "Doesn't seem normal to me. Nothing you do seems normal."<br><br>Carrie summed up. "You've gone from associating with sex workers to working nude in an office where everyone shows you respect for doing it." Jackson nodded at that while Charlotte broke into a grin which infected the others.<br><br>Amongst the grinning, Charlotte had to ask. "Any chance you can get me a job there? It sounds like paradise."<br><br>Samantha stopped and scowled at Charlotte. Then attended to Jackson again. "Hold on, with your good intentions, you're not going to convert the world are you? You're not going to have all the women working naked. And all the men showing them respect?"<br><br>Carrie struck a thoughtful pose, looking at Samantha. "Are you saying that like it's a bad thing? Surely that would be an improvement?"<br><br>Samantha raised her eyes to the heavens. "The world has gone mad."<br><br>Charlotte chose to not look impressed. "I do have to point out that the videos do not quite suggest the female sexual office utopia you seem to all think is just around the corner." She grinned at the reference.<br><br>Jackson hushed them down. "Originally they hired me to write the contracts. This is Australia, not The States. Let's just say that the working conditions are mailgirl friendly. And the other girls are a great bunch. I think you'd like them." Jackson looked around the table then stared hard at Charlotte changing her tone. "You've been looking at mailgirls videos, you naughty girl. And I'll be you other two have too!"<br><br>Carrie had to check. "Are you in them?"<br><br>Jackson shook her head smiling. "They're all made in The States. Even the one called Mailgirls of Melbourne or whatever it was. We had nothing to do with that, didn't even know about it." She leaned back in conspiratorially. "But we're going to change things there too. We're working on America. I have an infiltrator." Then she remembered. "You saw the current affairs special?"<br><br>To her surprise, the other three shook their heads. They did not know. "Are you in it?" Carrie asked.<br><br>"Even if I was, you wouldn't recognise me."<br><br>"I might have to hunt it down," Samantha sniffed. "I still cannot quite believe it. In, what, twelve hours time you'll be walking into the office there, taking off your clothes and wandering around naked for the next eight hours." She shook her head and then looked closely at Jackson. "I see you've muscled up."<br><br>Carrie reached over to feel Jackson's iron biceps. She smiled. "I'm really trying to see the downside here."<br><br>Samantha was not having that. "There just has to be one, I'm sorry. And I don't mean to demean you, Jackson. But I can't believe it is all as good as you say."<br><br>Charlotte scratched her chin. "But on the other hand, Samantha, Jackson looks perfectly okay to me. I'm sure if it was terrible she would be out of the place right away and doing the other stuff."<br><br>Samantha went in from another angle. "You're naked and available all day in your office, right? You must have feelings. There must be one man you enjoy being naked around?" Jackson's three friends all stared at her, wanting to know about that. But Jackson wouldn't be drawn, not even under that pressure.<br><br>"Does that sound like me?" she offered eventually.<br><br>Samantha could not help herself running with that. "More than one!" she exclaimed. Jackson bit her lip, said nothing. Eventually she gave into the others' mirth and gave them an apparently agreeing smile. But of course there was one man. And she was nowhere close to sorting out what to do there. She tried to change the subject. "You've all barely told me about what you've been up to."<br><br>Samantha brushed that off. "That's all not important. Not compared with what we're hearing about you." She looked Jackson up and down. "I can't believe it, our girl prancing around naked all day in front of strangers." She shook her head because she really could not believe it.<br><br>Jackson kept her grin in place. She had not really thought about it like that. It had been something sort of private to her, something that she kept as a thing within the Harada Industries office. Within those boundaries. But now what had she done? She was sharing it with her friends.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was sitting at his desk wondering why he bothered, thinking of calling up Jackson on the app, get her into his office for a chat. Except he saw that she had the day off. He was woken by a knock on his door. Kimiko came in. "Hi," he smiled, feeling a little bit lifted by her arrival.<br><br>"Hi," she whispered almost shyly. She stayed near the door as if for once if she was unsure about what Mitch expected. She even lifted a knee to cover her bare crotch as if she was embarrassed to be there with him.<br><br>"Everything all right..." Mitch stammered.<br><br>Kimiko looked down at the floor. "Uh, yeah," she breathed. She composed herself to look up at Mitch. "Shane needs to see you, something urgent in his office."<br><br>"Shane?" Mitch asked, surprised.<br><br>"I don't know what it is, but it's not the usual." Kimiko stared at Mitch, clearly hesitant. At which point Mitch remembered and checked his app. He clicked his acceptance then looked back to Kimiko. "Anything else?" he asked her, trying for some form of connection.<br><br>With her leg still obscuring her crotch, Kimiko leant towards Mitch and smiled. She blew him a kiss. And then sidling out of the door she was gone, leaving Mitch wondering where things were. He got up feeling unsteady, but ready to see what Shane wanted.<br><br>Despite his concerns about what Shane used it for, Mitch sat waiting on Shane's office couch waiting to hear why he had called him in for this meeting.<br><br>Shane strode in, coughed politely. "Sorry, I got caught up. Did Kimiko look after you?" Mitch reacted with a look of shock. Shane noticed his response. "I meant she gave you the message? She didn't tie you up or whatever she's into at the moment?" Shane smiled, he had meant nothing sinister, and it appeared that he did not know. Mitch's face returned to normal, Shane smiled. "I'll get straight to the point. I saw a video," he told Mitch as he went over to his desk and sat down to log back into his computer.<br><br>So what, thought Mitch, still mentally involved with Kimiko. "Another one," he responded drily.<br><br>Shane smiled because he had more. "A different one. This video you should be interested in. A reporter showed it to me." He looked hard at his screen. "I know it's here somewhere." Mitch stared at him from the couch, waiting to hear what was important about this. "Someone took this on their phone. So it's a bit grainy. Jumps around a bit."<br><br>"Come on," Mitch urged, "what's the point you're building up to?"<br><br>Shane looked away from his screen at Mitch, clearly not able to find the vid. And decided he better spill it. "There was a mailgirl demonstration at the Uni. I think it could be Emily. And The Age have got their hands on it."<br><br>Mitch looked unconcerned, even at that. "Could be? But you don't know who it is. They don't know who it is. Ah I see, someone from The Age tried to contact the sole mailgirl office in town?"<br><br>"They did," Shane reported. "This could be about Emily," he reminded his former boss. "It's here somewhere. Do you want to see it?"<br><br>Mitch was trying to avoid that. He could deny that it could be her so long as he did not have to look and identify her. Anyway, did he really want to see her like that? He had his answer for Shane though. "Oh, Emily wanted to be a mailgirl. A phase she was going through. She's past it now, that's all okay. Look, I'll admit I would not be completely surprised if it was her. But I think she would be more careful than that."<br><br>Or would she, Mitch wondered. Did he really know the twins? He suspected that with everything else happening he had not been paying attention recently. Sure they had been out on the town a lot. But they were sensible, right? Well at least Cara was sensible, and she would keep her sister out of trouble. Mitch felt okay.<br><br>But Shane honed in on Mitch's admission. "She wants to become a mailgirl. You won't let her. So she rebels by protesting about mailgirls by being a mailgirl?" That seemed plausible to him. Plus from the previous time he had watch the vid, he was pretty sure it was her. Had he deleted it?<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "Yes, we had words. She is not going to be a mailgirl here. And so far as I know there aren't any other opportunities in this town at the moment. I don't think she completely thought it through. Just a sudden impulse. I don't know, postponed teenage rebellion. After all she was never any trouble..." He felt a bit silly saying that, but since it was possible, he wanted to see what Shane thought.<br><br>"You seem quite calm about it?" Shane checked. He wondered what his response would be about his kids. He imagined that he would not be calm or impressed.<br><br>Mitch looked straight at him. "What am I supposed to do? Make it worse? Reignite the conflict? Maybe create a wall so she won't discuss things with me?"<br><br>Shane nodded. "I can see where you're coming from. Keep it cool and considered and at home."<br><br>Mitch grinned. "I never said it was cool and considered at home."<br><br>Shane thought about that for a moment. "Have you thought that it might be a good idea for her to realise her ambition in a safe space where you can monitor her?" he wondered. His look spelt volumes to Mitch who stared back. Unimpressed.<br><br>"I did not. And a safe space? Presumably with you around?" Mitch crossed his arms.<br><br>Shane pulled on a serious look. "I resent that slight on my character."<br><br>Mitch matched his colleague's look. "Resentment noted."<br><br>Shane smiled, changed the subject. "Do you want me to tell you the latest about the return of Lindsay's favourite journalist?"<br><br>"No," Mitch replied, "but you're going to."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Monika returned to the mezzanine. "Well, that was easy," she stated, for the benefit of the mailgirls waiting there for their next call.<br><br>On the farthest chair from the entrance point, Kimiko concentrated on her laptop. She had managed to fold one ankle up her knee so that although her legs were spread in the position the display chairs forced the mailgirls into, her pussy was, intentionally or not, partly concealed from anyone looking down onto the mailgirls area.<br><br>Closer to where Monika had stopped after she had come in, Pam was more casually using her laptop, happy to keep her legs spread for anyone who would notice. She looked up and smiled at Monika. "Getting used to it?" she asked her.<br><br>"Easiest job I've ever had," Monika replied. She walked over towards Pam. "Is this seat taken?" she joked about the spare seat next to Pam.<br><br>Pam smiled back. "I don't believe so," she replied, matching Monika's tone. Monika went to her locker to get her own laptop. As she sat next to Pam, Jan came out of the shower. She looked at the options. Since it was just the four of them and Kimiko was engrossed in her own stuff, Jan sat on the other side of Monika, also confirming if Monika was fine with the way things were going for her so far.<br><br>"Can I ask you some questions?" Monika asked of the mailgirls sitting on either side of her. Both of them had spread their legs to be the most comfortable in their chairs. But they both easily were able to turn to face Monika so that they could all have a conversation. "Sure," they both answered at the same time.<br><br>"Firstly," Monika asked kind of conspiratorially, "what is she doing?" She gestured carefully at Kimiko who was four empty seats away over in her corner.<br><br>Jan smiled. "We don't know, she doesn't tell us, and we don't pry. She was in the finance department before," she added, "so it's probably some mysterious accounting stuff."<br><br>"She's going to end up running the company," Pam added.<br><br>"Where did you hear that?" Jan asked a little sharply. Monika glanced over. If Kimiko was listening, she did not react or let on.<br><br>"Come on, we all know," Pam told her to Monika's amused interest, "she's Mr Harada's granddaughter." Monika raised a very amused eyebrow at that and looked over towards the apparently oblivious Kimiko in wonder. The boss's granddaughter was working as a naked mailgirl? What sort of company was this?<br><br>Jan read Monika's astonishment and shook her head. "I hear that there are at least two sons that come ahead of her in order of seniority. But could you imagine if she did?" They all smiled at the unlikelihood of that.<br><br>Monika let that wash over and then looked carefully at the two others. "Can I ask you something really personal?" she tried a little carefully.<br><br>"I guess so," Pam suggested.<br><br>"It doesn't mean that we'll answer it," Jan added.<br><br>Monika swallowed. "Do you get, um, turned on doing this?"<br><br>Pam smiled back at her. "What do you think?" Jan grinned too.<br><br>"And what are you supposed to do about it?" Monika stared back like she really had no idea.<br><br>"Didn't they tell you?" asked Jan with a hint of concern.<br><br>"Kind of vaguely. Like they were embarrassed about it..."<br><br>Jan sighed. "If Wendy was here, we'd get her onto it. And find out why they didn't have a proper orientation for you. I wonder where she is?" She looked around to see where their supervisor was. She was clearly not in the room. So Jan looked past Monika to Pam who had started after the rest of them. "Pam, what did they tell you when you started?"<br><br>Pam thought for a moment. "Nothing really. After I took my clothes off, they told me the basics. But then they gave me a few days to follow you all around to find out what was what."<br><br>Jan looked back to Monika. "Nothing like that for you?"<br><br>Monika shook her head. "They just told me to report here and get started."<br><br>Jan looked sympathetic. "So you don't know about the dildo stations?"<br><br>Monika's eyes widened. "The what?"<br><br>"Okay, here's the deal. Obviously they forgot to tell you. On the seventh, ninth and tenth floors if you know where to look there are some tables set up with a bunch of, well, implements on them. For our use only." Jan licked her lips. "And we do. We get ourselves off as much as we can. If you feel like it, you do it." Monika's eyes were wide now. And she shook her head in amazement. "I think a tour is in order," Jan concluded.<br><br>She stood up. Eagerly, Monika did too. She rubbed a finger over her lips. "I don't know if I'll get there in time," she joked. Pam and Jan both smiled at that.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>June took a couple of steps into Lindsay's office. "You wanted to see me?" she asked.<br><br>Lindsay beckoned her to come right in. Somehow June felt it appropriate to keep standing as she waited to find what the office boss wanted of her. Lindsay seemed to be checking her out, head to foot. "I hear you want to be a mailgirl."<br><br>June shuffled in her spot on the carpet. "Well, I'm thinking about it."<br><br>Lindsay apparently did not like her indecisiveness. "What is it? Your career? Your self-esteem? You realise that it is quite a pay rise on what you are getting now? How does the money sound?" She quoted a figure as June stood there helpless. Lindsay felt ruthless. "I can see you are still unsure. Here's a plan: You strip now. To prove that you can do it."<br><br>June took a breath. She had already been through similar with Mitch and Annette. But that atmosphere was more supportive, especially compared to Lindsay's approach.<br><br>"Well?" Lindsay asked sharply. "Strip now or you will never be a mailgirl." Was this clerk from HR wasting her time. "One chance." Lindsay felt a rush of enjoyment at June's conundrum.<br><br>June sighed and stepped up close to the desk, facing her stony faced boss across it. Well, she had somewhere to place her clothes. She undressed, folded her top, then the skirt. June had chosen a snazzy black matching bra and panty set. Which was now all that she was wearing, there in her boss's office. June thought that it made her look good. But Lindsay feigned not care. What she wanted was the worker in front of her undressed, completely nude. Snapping off her bra and stepping out of panties to place them with the rest of her clothes, June was now completely nude. She stood facing Lindsay with her hands at her sides.<br><br>Lindsay nodded. "Not bad, I've seen better. But I guess we can work you into shape. Now come here so I can give you a closer inspection."<br><br>June wondered at that. "Is that really allowed?" she asked, almost automatically suddenly finding some assertiveness.<br><br>Lindsay scratched her chin. "Probably not," she realised, "unless you agree to it." She knew the rules, as much as she disliked them.<br><br>"In that case, probably not," June decided, keeping her distance.<br><br>"Still, I do have to know how you will interact with staff when you are like that," Lindsay responded. She got up from her chair to walk up to and around the prospective mailgirl. She looked down her nose at June as she inspected her. "So you know all the rules?" Lindsay sneered, standing close to June, breathing on her shoulder.<br><br>"I do work in HR," June reminded her.<br><br>Lindsay sighed. "Do we need another trouble maker?"<br><br>Something about that got June bristling. But she also realised that there must be a vacancy for a new mailgirl, something which no one had yet directly confirmed. "Do you need someone who is prepared to work naked in the office every day? Someone from within the company, so there is already a level of understanding of the role?" June smiled at Lindsay, the way she liked to when making a point in a job interview.<br><br>Lindsay smiled back, somewhat threateningly. "Let's put that to the test, shall we?" And quicker than June could anticipate, Lindsay snatched up June's carefully folded clothes off her desk and stepped back behind it. She sat down, calmly opened a drawer in her return and placed them in there.<br><br>June was shaken. "What am I meant to do?" she blurted.<br><br>Lindsay crossed her arms. "Be a mailgirl." Then she gave June an up and down look as if she was seriously contemplating the other woman's predicament. "Come back and see me at five," she added sweetly, maybe too sweetly. "We'll get you dressed then."<br><br>After the initial shock June chose to embrace her predicament. She stepped out of Lindsay's office and did not flinch when Betty Cuthbert looked up and showed a flash of surprise that the clothed colleague who had gone into Lindsay's office was now walking out naked. June read Betty's surprise and even felt a little bit of power that she previously did not have. But how should she exercise it?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lindsay's final order as June left her office still rang in her ears. "Use the stairs." What choice did she have? June passed the lifts that would have returned her quickly to the ninth floor from the sixth and instead opened the door to the stairwell to trudge up the three flights of stairs. June had thought about the mezzanine but for some reason, she wanted the familiarity of her own desk first. She took her time since she was not on the clock, not yet. This was both good and bad. It meant that she could stretch out the time before she would have to present herself to her colleagues as she was. Or actually do the mailgirl thing. But it also meant that she had time to worry about the fact that in a short while she would actually have to do that. At least, for the moment, she had the stairwell to herself in her new, exposed state.<br><br>Taking a long deep breath, she opened the door to the ninth floor. No one was around. She walked past the lifts. No one was waiting there either. Next was the hard part. She had to head behind the partition and into her office. This was where she had a mild anxiety attack. This was it, into the place where she had worked every day with her clothes on, where the rest of the HR team worked too. She took another breath, closed her eyes for a moment then stepped in.<br><br>And the room seemed empty. Relieved, she strode naked past the desks and chairs towards her desk at the back of the room. Martin was sitting at his desk, the one pressed up to hers so that they worked facing each other. He was, as usual, staring at his screen. June smirked as she managed to walk past without him noticing. She sat at her desk facing him.<br><br>"Where is everyone?" June asked, as normal as she could be, given her circumstances.<br><br>Martin looked up to answer her and of course his eyes dilated with shock. He said nothing for a moment, processing. He could only see her bare breasts above the table. But given what he could see and what they had discussed, he suspected the rest. Eventually he spoke. "Am I supposed to look at you or what?" he asked.<br><br>Having observed Annette, June found to her surprise that she could channel the mailgirl's sass. "You're a big boy, you work it out," she stated. "Now where is everyone?"<br><br>Martin realised that he could calmly answer that. "Optional training session. Work relations skills. Whatever that is."<br><br>"An excuse to get out of an hour or so's work," June smiled. She could be nude and be her old self, she realised.<br><br>Belinda Clarke stepped out of her office, intent on heading to another floor. She saw bare flesh towards the back of the room and realised that she should investigate.<br><br>Belinda came over. "Hi June, is it a virus?" she asked, like a good boss.<br><br>June was working quickly into her role. "No thanks, I'm feeling perfectly okay," she replied brightly.<br><br>Belinda set an emotional distance. "I have to ask are you a mailgirl or what? We have rules about office attire."<br><br>June backed away a little uncertain. "I'm not sure," she wavered. "I think I start tomorrow, on probation."<br><br>Belinda shook her head, not happy. "My job gets more difficult. I guess I'll have to speak to Lindsay and sort it out." Belinda even rolled her eyes. "If this is happening, I'll bet she didn't even think of a replacement."<br><br>Of course June had no idea of that. Belinda returned to her office no doubt trying to work out what do about this latest situation.<br><br>Seeing no alternative, June went back to the work that she was doing on her computer. After some moments of uninterrupted working, she realised that Martin was trying to attract her attention. She looked away from her computer, over at him.<br><br>Martin made eye contact with a concerned look on his face. "I have to ask," he started then hesitated, "um, are you all right with, uh, this?"<br><br>'Uh, this' was obviously the fact that she was there at her desk completely nude and supposedly trying to decide whether to become a mailgirl and be this way in the office every day. She realised that her breasts were openly on display to Martin and anyone else in the office who cared to look. She glanced down. She felt proud that they hung nicely, not at all drooping, her small pink nipples pointing out just so.<br><br>"Actually, yes I'm all right," she smiled back at Martin. Although she had not made up her mind yet. But her body was signalling that this was a buzz, a thrill, a dare, something she had never imagined doing herself. Martin went back to his work. June barely thought about it as she reached down to stroke herself, below the desk where he couldn't see even if he was looking. It felt good, she felt good. Maybe she could face the mezzanine. She knew, she was going to be a mailgirl.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson strode into Mitch's office. She knew that she should knock but she did not expect that she would be interrupting anything urgent. Which was the case. Mitch looked up at her sheepishly.<br><br>"You called me to deliver a message?" she stated blandly. Something in the air suggested to her there was some distance between them.<br><br>Mitch looked befuddled. "I did?" What was this sheepishness? He looked to his app and then realised. After the engineers' audit the mailgirls had reduced the number of calls they organised via their hack. But they did still use it occasionally. Mitch finally clicked. "Oh, so they didn't find the hack?" he realised.<br><br>"No," Jackson smiled. "Or if they did they haven't done anything about it." She sat down opposite Mitch deliberately hitching one leg over the armrest of her chair and stretching out the other, she planted a foot on his desk. The effect was to totally expose herself to her former boss and mentor. However, she refrained from any stimulation. Just making sure that Mitch could see everything.<br><br>Despite her provocative pose Jackson gave Mitch a serious look. "It's getting worse," she told him.<br><br>"Lindsay?" Mitch asked although he knew that was the answer. Jackson nodded. "What has she done now?" he asked, the crux of the matter.<br><br>Jackson sighed. She decided to list everything to test on Mitch how bad it was. To see what he thought about it. She wondered if there was a chance that she was overreacting. "You know that she has stopped the incentives scheme. She's now saying that there is a technical hitch in our bonus accounting that needs to be fixed. So no credits to our bonuses. Jan went into the system and looked at it but she reckons it's all okay and is working as it should. But of course the bonus money was icing on our very rich cake, so it is hard to get too bolshie about that. We can't forget that we are well paid. Plus there's the hiring freeze for the rest of the staff..."<br><br>Mitch nodded. "There has been muttering that the only new hires are mailgirls," he added. "And the staff — Lauryn, Annette, Jan, Heather, Kimiko — who became mailgirls still have not been replaced." Mitch knew he hesitated when he said Kimiko's name. Did Jackson notice?<br><br>Apparently not. "She was clever with the chairs," Jackson continued. "Using the excuse of ergonomics, easier use of our laptops and all that. But we weren't consulted or warned of the change, so in the current climate it seems like a punishment of sorts — or at least a backwards step. The exposure we can live with..." Jackson ran a finger along her slit to remind Mitch that she was as exposed to him right there as they were in the chairs to anyone who cared to look down to the mezzanine from the other floors.<br><br>"I noticed that it separates you," Mitch provided. "Previously you could slouch on the benches while you were on your laptops and you could chat in groups. Now you can only really talk to the person next to you."<br><br>Jackson thought about that for a short moment. "I wonder if she planned that?" she pondered out loud. Put the way that Mitch had, it certainly seemed so.<br><br>"What else is new?" he asked. Sensing that she wanted to fill him in on further outrages. That was just the way that things were heading at the moment.<br><br>Jackson sighed. "Lindsay interviewed one of the staff about becoming a mailgirl. Then sent her back to her desk naked."<br><br>"June?" Mitch asked.<br><br>"You knew?" Jackson was surprised into being careful. How did he know?<br><br>Mitch leaned forward. "Don't worry. She came to talk to me before she evidently saw Lindsay. She was thinking about it and I discussed it with her. Didn't Annette tell you?"<br><br>The penny dropped. Jackson smiled. "Annette told me that you and her had some fun with someone who was wondering about mailgirls. Ah, she didn't tell me who. And she did not tell me exactly what you got up to?" Almost without thinking about what she was doing, Jackson began to stroke herself in front of Mitch. Well she was facing him. But she got the sense that he was trying not to focus on her doing that. "Mitch," she asked, hoping for his expert assistance.<br><br>However, he seemed distant. "I have a better idea." He went to the app then looked over at Jackson who gave up, put her feet on the floor, and sat back down relatively demurely. "While we're waiting," Mitch continued, "let's get these issues down on paper and decided which are the most critical."<br><br>Jan came in while they were grading the importance of the issues. Mitch looked up at her and smiled warmly. "Can you see if you can get Lindsay up here urgently?" he asked her. "I... uh, we have an issue."<br><br>Jan agreed. Just as she was about to leave she stopped. "Do you want me to come back with her?" she asked.<br><br>Mitch thought about that for a short moment. "Why not?" he agreed. And looked to Jackson who agreed.<br><br>Jan returned with Lindsay. The office boss strode in, ahead of the mailgirl giving Jackson and Mitch the impression that she had marched in front of Jan the whole way. "What is urgent?" she asked Mitch, having stopped a short distance from his desk and remained standing in a spot where Jackson had to swivel around to see her. Jan looked apprehensive and stayed back well behind Lindsay.<br><br>Mitch realised that soft selling introductions would not work. He looked at the list he had concocted with Jackson and referenced the approved mailgirls agreement.<br><br>"I'll stop you there," Lindsay butted in. "I don't like the agreement, but everything I do is acceptable within the agreement." Jackson looked to say her piece. She did not get the chance as Lindsay continued. "If you don't like it, there are other places you can work. And there are other mailgirls who are happy to take your place." Lindsay stood there for a moment counting on the silence of the others in the room, knowing that there was nothing constructive they could throw back at her. She smiled, thinly. "I think this meeting is over," she stated and turned, strode out, almost bumping into Jan on the way.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Fanny Durack stepped cautiously into Shane's office. Her concern was greatened when she saw Shane was sitting on his couch. Which she knew was a bad mailgirl omen unless you had an itch to scratch. And today she did not. She stood near the door.<br><br>Shane sensed something of Fanny's apprehension. "Close the door," he asked. "And sit anywhere you want."<br><br>Fanny obeyed the first command. And then she strode over and sat in Shane's chair behind his desk. She leaned towards the office second in charge, her large breasts swinging, she knew, just enough to distract the man who usually seemed to usually get something from a visit by a mailgirl.<br><br>Shane remained sitting where he was with his arms crossed, so he must have got the message. "I have a problem — not that one," he started, "and I was hoping that you could help me." Fanny stared over at him but she was not going to give him anything until he explained. "I have to phone Rosemary before she calls me. She wants to come back to be a mailgirl for a day." Fanny maintained her poker face. "I'm sure you know already know that, the way word gets around in this place," Shane continued. "So I'm wondering what sort of reception she is going to get from the mailgirls if she tries that."<br><br>"She'll be with a camera crew of course," Fanny replied.<br><br>"There will be a camera crew," Shane confirmed.<br><br>Fanny sighed. "I'm not sure how you can expect it to go any better than last time. Anyone tuning in to see a naked Rosemary Millwall is going to be disappointed. Anything that can't be hidden by skilful editing is going to be blurred out. In here we will all get an eyeful of your high profile journalist in the all-together. Her camera crew and you, no doubt, will get to enjoy it. And what's the point of it all anyway? What is she likely to get onto the TV this time that didn't get on the first time?"<br><br>Shane nodded. "But," he started. Fanny raised an eyebrow. He continued. "The boss. Lindsay likes the idea because well, more publicity. And Rosemary keeps going on at me about discovering the true mailgirl experience." He read Fanny's unimpressed look. "Yeah, I know."<br><br>Fanny shook her head. "Look, what do you want me to say?"<br><br>"Well, it's going to happen. I'm just hoping it doesn't end like Day of The Locusts."<br><br>"Shane! We're all nice people. We're even nice to you."<br><br>Shane grinned at that. "Were you thinking..." he started.<br><br>Fanny crossed her arms over her bare breasts. "Not today Shane. Save yourself up for Rosemary."<br><br>"Do you really think so?" Shane automatically responded.<br><br>Fanny stood up, still mostly covering her body with her hands. She shook her head in amazement at the man's chutzpah. "She'll be naked and no doubt after she has spent an hour or two prancing around here showing everything off to the office and her film crew who will be capturing her every move — even though they won't be able to show on TV, she'll be gagging for it, especially from you."<br><br>Fanny had maintained a degree of sarcasm which Shane would certainly not miss. But because she could not resist her own fun, she put her hands on her hips and stood full frontal facing Shane for a moment. "Do you have any messages for me? Anything you want me to ask Mitch?" she teased. She was starting to get turned on so she squeezed a nipple between two fingers for a moment. Shane said nothing as he watched her. So she left. Some other time, seemed the best idea. And she had time, she decided, for the dildo station on the next floor up.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "Seriously? Anyone can become a mailgirl down under?", 
                    content: `Betty Cuthbert, the PA to the office boss Lindsay Davenport was not happy. She sat at her desk outside Lindsay's office too distracted to do her work. What she saw earlier kept replaying in her mind, pissing her off more each time. The neat, personable woman from HR had smiled at her and gone into Lindsay's office as normal as could be. After a time, she had stumbled back out, and slunk past Betty avoiding any contact. She was now completely naked and clearly not comfortable with her change. For some reason that Betty could not specify, that crossed a line for her. She made up her mind and got up and without knocking she went into Lindsay's office.<br><br>Lindsay sat working at her PC apparently unaffected by whatever had just happened in her office. At Betty's loud intrusion, she looked up, with a bland expression. But Lindsay sensed an issue about to be raised, this intrusion was rare. "Is something up Betty?" she asked.<br><br>The PA crossed her arms. "What did you do to her?" she asked, trying to be casual but with an unmissable quiver in her voice.<br><br>Lindsay stayed completely calm. Signs of angst in others did that to her, a control thing. "I did nothing to her. She did it all to herself."<br><br>Betty stared back at Lindsay, not sure now what to say. But at the moment two mailgirls, the tall Pam Burridge and the buxom Fanny Durack strode into the office together. Fanny smiled at Betty as she continued to Lindsay's desk. She did not smile at Lindsay though.<br><br>Pam sensed that something was not quite right. The athletic blonde looked worried, noticing Betty's grimace. "Have we picked a bad time?" she asked. "Should we wait outside?" But it was a bit late for that.<br><br>Fanny put one hand on Lindsay's desk and looked over to Pam to see what her problem was. Fanny could not see any issues, so she looked to Lindsay. "You wanted us?" She stood there, naked and close to the boss waiting, knowing it was pointless to joke or flirt with Lindsay.<br><br>And Lindsay was businesslike with Fanny. "I have this message for Stuart. Can you ask him for a reply and then come back with it?" She gave Fanny a distant managerial smile then handed over a folded slip of paper. Fanny stood there for a moment. Lindsay darkened a little. "The timer's running," she snapped at the mailgirl who glanced over at the other two then made her way out.<br><br>Betty and Pam both stood where they were.<br><br>Lindsay looked over at them. "Ah yes mailgirl..." she started.<br><br>"Pam," the mailgirl informed her.<br><br>"Yes, um, Pam," Lindsay retorted like she had just eaten something bitter. "I need you to go to Belinda Clarke with this message. It's quite involved..."<br><br>"Is it about that naked girl I saw on the stairs?" Pam asked, with a hint of concern about the woman who was not a mailgirl walking naked on the stairs.<br><br>"There are some matters..." Lindsay started to dissemble.<br><br>"What was she doing naked if she is not a mailgirl?" Pam asked. Betty silently watched her, curious to see where things would go. And partially pleased that someone else was picking up her issue.<br><br>"Do you have to get involved in everything in this office?" Lindsay snapped back.<br><br>Pam was not fazed. "Well, when it involves us and what we are doing here, yes." She held her ground and continued. "Was she delivering a message that should have been delivered by a mailgirl? Wouldn't that be breaking the rules? I think you will find that only mailgirls are allowed to be naked in the office unless we give our consent. You just can't make someone a mailgirl." Pam stood strong, expecting an answer. Betty suspected that she may not need to say anything more, Pam had it all covered.<br><br>"Do you know who runs this office?" Lindsay retaliated.<br><br>Pam held her ground. "I know that there are rules and contracts about who can do what here, especially in regards to us." She stared at Lindsay who stared vehemently back. Still she did not waver. Rather, she strode up to Lindsay's desk, her firm breasts swaying angrily with the momentum of her approach. "If you weren't concerned about the rules, you wouldn't have me going to HR with this message," she concluded. There was icy silence because she was right.<br><br>Lindsay privately cursed. She had selected Pam thinking the newer and blonder mailgirl would be less of a bother than the obviously bolshie ones. Pam overegged a genial smile as Lindsay handed over the message to her. Expecting that Lindsay would still be watching her, she strode out exaggerating the sway of her hips and the roll of her curvaceous bottom. As if she could also be the naked office bimbo if she chose.<br><br>Betty remained where she had stood during the exchanges. Lindsay looked hard at her. "Are you happy with that?" Lindsay accused as if Pam's attitude was somehow the PA's fault.<br><br>"I don't know that you can enjoy running this office like that," Betty bit back, holding Lindsay's gaze.<br><br>Lindsay was not going to let that go. "You have no idea what it's like," she slung back at her PA who decided that there would be no point retaliating and retreated back to her desk outside Lindsay's office without another word.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson climbed the stairs to the ninth floor, finding herself thinking about Mitch, wondering if she had been imagining some change in him or whether he had been purposely cold to her recently. Had she done or said something wrong? After all, it was odd that he did not want to get her off. Well, she considered, maybe it's a phase. Like everyone, he's allowed to be occasionally moody. Hopefully, it was just a bad one-off occasion. She strode out of the stairwell, through into HR and headed straight to Belinda Clarke's office. She sat down at Belinda's meeting table and looked over to the Head of HR.<br><br>"We haven't had a chance to chat for a while," Belinda started.<br><br>"I know," the mailgirl agreed. "And there's a few things going on."<br><br>"You don't say," Belinda replied. "Pam was just here delivering Lindsay's latest demands. I expect she will tell you."<br><br>"I was in a meeting earlier with Lindsay," Jackson told Belinda. "It was unplanned otherwise I would have made sure that you were there." Belinda nodded as the mailgirl continued. "I raised the changes that she has been making. And I think that she has more plans for us. She's a good operator. All the changes that she's made are all stuff that she can get away with by bending the agreement."<br><br>"And what's the attitude among the mailgirls?"<br><br>"Of course we'd be happier if she told us in advance. We're all waiting to see if she attacks something that's really important to us. Like I said, she's chipped around the edges so far. Stuff that we're not happy about but which we can live with."<br><br>Belinda nodded. "We'll do what we can here, but she knows the rules and so far she's playing within them. But then you know that." Jackson nodded back her assent. She considered for a moment how normal she found sitting there naked with a fabric discussing office regulations and such. Despite her friends' reactions when she told them she was a mailgirl, well it was her normal now. Belinda continued. "And we have a situation if you didn't see it on the way in." Jackson looked at her, confused. Clearly she had not seen. Jackson wondered what else there was so soon after what she thought was a detente with Lindsay. Belinda explained. "Go down the back and say hello to the pair who look after the temp staff before you go."<br><br>Jackson did and found June concentrating on her screen. She sensed that Martin was trying to concentrate on his work and not succeeding. And now he had a second naked women near him. Jackson greeted him and he looked up at her like she was all he needed at the moment. That caused June to look up albeit shyly.<br><br>"What are you doing?" Jackson asked her automatically, a little sharper than she intended.<br><br>June looked down at her desk. "The monthly reconciliation," she muttered.<br><br>"That wasn't what I meant," Jackson replied although this time with a smile, expecting that June and Martin would not laugh at that. "Not just anyone is allowed to do that," she added. You're quite cute, Jackson thought but kept that to herself.<br><br>June looked dejectedly at the mailgirl. "I would put my clothes back on if I had them."<br><br>"Okay," Jackson relented, "what happened?" June explained. Jackson stared at the HR clerk thinking that she could fit in as a mailgirl if that was the way that she wanted to go. But still, rules are rules. "Lindsay should know that she cannot do this to you," Jackson told her.<br><br>"It happened so quickly," June complained. "Really there was nothing I could do. She was persuasive, and I just kind of agreed. Since I thought it was an interview. I didn't expect..." Neither of the naked women paid attention to Martin who was trying to look nonchalant but not succeeding.<br><br>Jackson was wrestling with the problem that with June Lindsay had again stretched the rules. Lindsay would no doubt argue that you could not hire someone to be a mailgirl without making sure that they were comfortable without clothes in the office. And Jackson recalled that was part of how the Melbourne mailgirls were in fact recruited. But it was a question of what was reasonable. June apparently had to work all afternoon at her usual job naked. Which just seemed, well, cruel.<br><br>Jackson thought back to her hiring. She now knew that she was the exception. All the other mailgirls had to strip off during their interview. For some reason, Mitch — and she — just assumed that she would be fine taking her clothes off when the crunch came. Well, they were right. But why was Mitch so sure? She straightened up. Her thoughts were getting her off the track.<br><br>"So do you want to be a mailgirl?" Jackson asked June who, Jackson noticed, made no attempt to in any way cover her exposed body.<br><br>June scratched at her nipple. "You all seem so confident about it."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "We get that all the time. But don't forget, we had to start somewhere. You should have seen us after the first day. I assume that you haven't signed anything yet?" June shook her head. "Good, think about it for as long as you need. You don't need to be rushed into signing. And do come and see me — or get me to come up here — if you decide to go and do it. And I'll fill you in on your rights." She looked at June for a moment, remembering that this was HR. "That is, assuming that you don't already know them."<br><br>June looked back at the mailgirl blankly. Jackson smiled warmly back. This situation was, at least, one issue that Lindsay had created that could be solved easily.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The four people, the total audience watching in the Union Theatre, all lounged in the front row waiting for the promised start. Emily Johnson strode from the wings to the centre of the stage. She stared at her audience and cleared her throat to make sure that group, all of whom were previously involved in the one night only production of Mailgirls In The Office, were paying her heed.<br><br>"Thanks for coming," Emily started. "Cara and I are workshopping a few ideas to see if we can run another production with you, that's why we invited you..."<br><br>"Did you invite Rod?" Bill asked her.<br><br>Emily smiled. "I thought we should work on some ideas first and then tackle him later."<br><br>"Or get someone else," Sarah suggested. She seemed serious, and none of the others challenged her on that. Their former leading man was no longer their favourite person.<br><br>They were all silent for a moment. "Let's get started," Emily advised after that pause. She looked off stage and sure enough, her twin sister walked on. She was naked. "Cara's playing me for tonight," Emily explained. She then looked thoughtfully at her sister. "Are you ready for this? It takes nerve..."<br><br>Cara smiled at her. "Does it? I though you could just ignore everything around you..."<br><br>"But if that's the case we would not be out here on the street with you protesting the exploitation by big business of attractive young women as mailgirls. Naked for all the world to see!"<br><br>"It's empowering!" Sarah shouted from her seat, hoping to get a laugh.<br><br>"How would you know?" Emily asked Sarah who clammed up. Wrong wavelength. Emily shot her sister a stern look, and Cara got down on her knees, back arched in the standard mailgirl position.<br><br>All eyes were on Sarah for an explanation. Sarah crossed her arms and said nothing.<br><br>Emily smiled at Sarah and confirmed "yes, it is empowering." Sarah was able to relax into a smile as thanks for her support.<br><br>"Now for our next trick, we need a volunteer from the audience." Emily pretended to look amongst the four onlookers. She stopped and addressed her intended victim. "Bill, would you mind?" she smiled. Of course he did not mind and he stood up to the others' ironic applause and made his way up the steps onto the stage. "Now," Emily explained while Cara maintained her kneeling position, although now with look of mild concern. Apparently she did not expect this escalation and did not know what was going to happen next.<br><br>The stage was empty of any props. So Bill stood slightly to one side, close to Emily but a space away from the kneeling mailgirl who was watching her sister carefully. "Bill," Emily told him, "you're the boss in a mailgirl office. You've got, say, six of them working for you. Now if you wanted to fuck any of your mailgirls, how would you choose which one?"<br><br>Bill looked at the naked Cara who had recovered her composure and was now regarding him from the corner of her eye with a hint of warning on her face. He looked back to Emily who in her current persona was dressed. But she had been naked on that very stage as his mailgirl in front of a full house. He looked back at Cara again as he tried to assemble his thoughts.<br><br>Feeling confident, Bill smiled at Emily with his answer. "Which mailgirl would I choose? It would have to be one who wanted to fuck me," he concluded. Not because it was a nice answer. But because Bill felt he was a decent person and it was the right answer. He smiled at Cara who grimaced back.<br><br>Emily nodded. But she was not satisfied. "And how would you know that a particular mailgirl wanted to fuck you? Don't forget that the usual signals might be a bit askew. What with the mailgirls already being naked and exposed. And probably already turned on, maybe by things that did not involve you at all."<br><br>Bill nodded. "Yeah," he agreed, "it would have to be a pretty explicit consent." He walked over and placed a gentle hand on Cara's bare shoulder. She gave Bill an inconclusive look, so he kept his hand there. But he did not move it.<br><br>Emily looked to Cara who nodded back at her. Bill was onto something. She looked to Bill. "And if a mailgirl wanted to fuck you and for whatever reason you didn't want to have her?"<br><br>Bill smiled. "That's a hard one. You obviously don't want to hurt her feelings. Especially when she is naked and horny."<br><br>Cara looked up at Bill and smiled. "Maybe some other time," she told him. He quickly took his hand off her and stepped away.<br><br>Driving home with Cara, Emily pondered what Bill had revealed to them. "Both dad and the mailgirl must have agreed on it," she concluded. "Assuming," she added, "that Bill is representative of the male managerial class. That he knows about such things."<br><br>Cara nodded at that. But still she wondered "Is it real? It's not real. Maybe Bill was playing a role. After all, the boss that he played on stage was our creation. And what real knowledge about bosses do we have?"<br><br>"Well, there's Dad," Emily started. "At least the sort of characteristics that he wanted us to see..."<br><br>Cara nodded. "So we wrote Bill's character to reflect dad. That makes sense. Which one do you think Dad fucked?"<br><br>"The one who looks the least like mum," Emily laughed.<br><br>"Oh, why?" wondered Cara, "I'm sure I read somewhere that men often have affairs with women who resemble their wives."<br><br>"What would be the point of that?" Emily asked her sister. "Seems like a lot of trouble to go to."<br><br>"But that's not Dad," Cara decided. "If he is going to do something like that, which he obviously did, he would look to the one most different to her. Like our family holidays in the most exotic locations."<br><br>Emily laughed. "Mum only eating food that she had heard about before. And Dad ordering stuff that he couldn't even pronounce. So which one do you think it is?"<br><br>"It would probably be obvious if we knew who all the mailgirls are."<br><br>"Another stakeout?" Emily looked hopeful.<br><br>Cara smiled at the idea. Then she got a bit serious. "Sis," she asked, "I need to blow off some steam after not fucking Bill."<br><br>Emily's eyes lit up. "Let's go to Carringbush," she chuntered. "And you're paying since you got yourself into this predicament." She reached over and patted Cara on the pussy to make her point.<br><br>Cara groaned. "Seems like a good idea, sis," she grunted.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch was sitting at the breakfast table when the twins wandered in. "You were out late last night," he noted.<br><br>Cara acted bewildered. "We were?"<br><br>"I think he's trying to demonstrate interest in the goings-on of his daughters," Emily told her sister.<br><br>"Or show concern that we might be going astray," Cara replied.<br><br>Emily put her hands on her hips. "That is possible. After all, the example that he is setting. Maybe he's concerned that we have the same genes?"<br><br>Mitch tried to adopt his daughters' offhand attitude "Interest, just showing interest. I think I've been taking you two for granted."<br><br>Cara acted worried. "Don't you have a job to go to?" she asked theatrically.<br><br>Mitch smiled. "They're not going to miss me there. At least not for a few hours."<br><br>Emily thought she sensed something strange in her father's demeanour. "Have you fucked the mailgirl again?" she asked.<br><br>Mitch looked away quickly. "That's not what I wanted to talk to you about." Then he thought better of it. "Well, maybe I should. I guess this family could do with being more open." Mitch stalled with a cough. This was going to be difficult, he realised.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mitch Johnson was naked. Kimiko Date was naked. Naked except that she had a shibaru rope wrapped a number of times around her waist and up higher, almost like a corset. Her crotch and her breasts were bare and available to her lover. But she held another length of rope in her hands as she stood still, facing her man. "Just stand up straight with your hands behind your back," she told Mitch.<br><br>Mitch sighed privately. Why did women want to treat him like this? Well Jessica and Kimiko at least. He clasped his hands behind his back as she had asked.<br><br>Kimiko may have read Mitch's thoughts. "I'm testing out a theory," she explained. By now she had bound Mitch's hands behind him and then tightened the rope around Mitch's ankles in turn which as well as restricting his hands, meant that he was hobbled too, unable to walk more than short steps. He chose the easy route, turned himself around to sit on Kimiko's bed. Now it was easy for her to push Mitch flat onto his back, his hard cock pointing straight up.<br><br>"Do you want me to do something about this?" Kimiko teased as she playfully slapped his cock from side to side. Gently.<br><br>"Have you thought about sitting on it?" Mitch asked hopefully.<br><br>Kimiko acted shocked. "I had not thought of that," she stated. "Do you mean like this?" She got up on the bed on her knees, facing Mitch, resting her crotch on his knees. Then she started to edge herself up his thighs. Sensing where Kimiko was moving her crotch, Mitch's cock throbbed, as he anticipated some intimate contact from his lover. Seeing this, Kimiko smiled at her prone victim. "Do you deserve it?" she asked in a serious voice. Now her crotch was mere millimetres from where his sac and cock joined. But no touching. Yet.<br><br>Inching forward, Kimiko let Mitch's cock press against her belly for a moment before pushing it flat to Mitch's chest as she ran her slit up and down it, careful not to insert. Mitch groaned in exquisite frustration. Kimiko seemed in no hurry to satisfy him. "This is working for me," she smiled as she continued her enjoyment and his torment. Mitch twitched under her treatment, groaning from the pleasure sensations and from the constrictions and the exquisite frustration. Until Kimiko stopped with her opening as close to Mitch's cock as it could be without him slipping in.<br><br>"I guess that is enough of that for now," Kimiko mused, again in her distant voice as she pinched her nipples. She shifted slightly so that at last the head of Mitch's cock slid into her channel. And groaning from the pleasure of that she let him slide all the way in.<br><br>They were quickly at it. It was such a relief that both of them came pretty soon after they hit their rhythm. As Mitch thrust his last, Kimiko leaned over to give him a hug, a strong one as she whispered promises at him, in an embrace that he could not yet return.<br><br>Gently, Kimiko rolled off, keeping eye contact with Mitch as she lay on her side. "I want to keep you like that," she teased.<br><br>Mitch smiled and just stared back into her eyes, soaking up the moment, immersed in the sensuality of their naked post-coital bliss. Sensing that they were both about to drift back to their regular selves, Mitch mentioned to Kimiko that he had told his wife about her, about their first time.<br><br>Kimiko stiffened up. "Why did you do that?" she asked, trying to sound balanced.<br><br>Mitched looked hopefully into Kimiko's eyes. "It doesn't change anything. Does it?"<br><br>Kimiko shook her head in disgust. "Men! I should have just Mrs Ogawa tie me up again. That would be easier."<br><br>Mitch looked slightly wounded. "It will be all right," he pleaded.<br><br>"Oh really?" Kimiko was not convinced.<br><br>Mitch continued. Had he really thought properly about how he should deliver the news? Or whether he should even actually deliver it? "She just wants to meet you," he blurted.<br><br>Kimiko stared in disbelief. "Oh, this gets better," she uttered. Mitch looked back at her surprised at her reaction. Clearly he had not really thought it through.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Fanny wandered out of the showers, drying her hair and looked around. "Oh," she observed, "it's only you at the moment?"<br><br>Pam was just coming back into the mezzanine and had not yet decided which way she was going. She gave the other mailgirl a surprised look. "Are you disappointed?" she asked.<br><br>Fanny did not buck at that directness. "No, I was just surprised by the silence. Every time I've been out here recently, it's been a bustle of activity," she explained. Then she relaxed. "Gives you and me a chance to get to know each other a bit better. Every time we're around, you're either in the middle of things or about to get another call out."<br><br>Pam glanced down her model's body. "Yes, I do seem to get a lot of calls. Probably more than my share."<br><br>Fanny smiled. "I can see why." They both laughed. "Shall we?" she asked indicating the display chairs. She did not get an immediate response from Pam. "Unless you are expecting to get another call?" Some of the mailgirls chose to have a quick shower between calls as Fanny just had. "Were you going to shower?" she asked the taller mailgirl.<br><br>But Pam shook her head as she checked her app. "I'm on a break. It's ten minutes before anyone can book me, so I'm good. And she now gestured to the chairs so Fanny got to follow her as she chose her seat, Fanny taking the one next to her.<br><br>Once they had settled, with their laptops secure on the armrests and with their legs spread as the seats forced them, Pam turned to Fanny. "How are things with..."<br><br>"Simon," Fanny concluded for her. "No chance of keeping anything secret in this office."<br><br>Pam laughed. "Come on, I've seen you too together. I would not use the word 'discrete' to describe what I saw. Now, you've got to tell me. It must be weird to be naked around him whenever you see him here. And then outside..."<br><br>Fanny took a breath and then completed Pam's sentence. "...we go out to dinner and I'm dressed, and he says things like 'I wondered what you look like with your clothes on' and I say 'I wondered what you look like with your clothes off" and well..."<br><br>"Tell me," Pam laughed.<br><br>Fanny sighed. "Yes, okay, surprise. I do know what he looks like with his clothes off." She laughed.<br><br>Pam raised an eyebrow. "So what's it like now when you see him in the office?"<br><br>"Well," Fanny laughed again. "I think it's good for the relationship. I've made him get me off a few times in the past week or two, in the office. Of course I remind him of the rules. So he has to get me off according to my instructions. While of course he has to keep all his clothes on, and there's nothing for him."<br><br>"Cruel," Pam commented. "Does he know about Shane?"<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"Well, if you wanted to with Simon in the office you could just find somewhere private and go for it."<br><br>"What, and mix work and pleasure?"<br><br>The two mailgirls sat facing each other for a moment, smiling into each other's eyes. Pam spoke up first. "I hope you don't mind me getting personal, but I love your breasts."<br><br>Fanny sat up and lifted both of her pendulous breasts at Pam. "You mean these problems?" she teased.<br><br>"They're not problems," Pam argued back, reaching over to stroke one of Fanny's prominent nipples. Then she got suddenly self-conscious and stopped. "I've wanted to do that for so long, I hope you don't mind," she apologised.<br><br>"You think I'm just a set of oversized breasts?" Fanny answered back.<br><br>Pam stopped her stroking with a look of shock. "Of course not!" she exploded, "you're the brainiest one of us all."<br><br>Fanny smiled again. "I don't know about that. But don't stop what you were doing to me before. It was rather nice."<br><br>Pam smiled back, relieved. She resumed stroking Fanny's breast for a short moment before switching to the other one. Then she remembered to check her app. "Oh," she exclaimed, "play time's over. I've got a call." She leant over and down and kissed Fanny's breast. "Let's continue this later," she promised as she got up to see what the IT department wanted.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Up on the eleventh floor, Jackson stood facing the head of the engineering department, Mick Doohan, who sat at his desk with a sceptical look on his face. She was trying to explain the mailgirls tribunals to him.<br><br>"It's not punitive," the naked mailgirl explained.<br><br>"So how is it supposed to work then?" Mick asked her, clearly not convinced. "I don't see the point."<br><br>Jackson tried to sound like the HR manual. "If a mailgirl feels that she has been insulted or otherwise has not been fairly treated, it provides a forum where she can explain her issues and feelings and the other party can get to see her point of view and also speak about theirs. Remember, this is all new to Australia. And management would rather see these sort of matters resolved at this casual level rather than have to be dealt with formally."<br><br>"Perhaps," Mick mumbled, never completely convinced by situations that were not black and white.<br><br>A colleague came over to Mick's desk. "Sorry to disturb you but I've got that report you asked for," a tall, well dressed engineer explained. He placed a file on Mick's desk.<br><br>"You could have emailed it, Bryce," Mick pointed out.<br><br>"Yeah, but it's a bit more complicated than that. And you said not to email some of this stuff." Bryce stared at the mailgirl and Jackson stared back at him. They both sensed something they liked in what they saw.<br><br>Mick noticed that — or at least that they were showing unwarranted interest in each other. "Thanks Bryce, that will be all," he snapped, dismissing the other engineer. He then looked back at Jackson. "So we're done?"<br><br>"Yes," Jackson agreed. "I'll come up with some dates for the tribunal after talking to the mailgirl involved." She paused for a beat. And noticed that Bryce was taking his time to leave her presence. "I'll email them to you," she smiled at Mick. And caught Bryce's eye. He smiled at her spunk. Glancing over at Mick to make sure he wasn't watching her, Jackson smiled back at Bryce.<br><br>She then started to leave the floor and found Bryce by her side walking away from Mick's desk with her. "I don't believe that I've seen you before," she offered.<br><br>Bryce grinned. "I'm one of the quieter ones. But I was there in the induction. Keeping quiet."<br><br>"Ah okay, Mr Quiet," Jackson responded, "I'm leaving now, going back to the mezzanine." But still he walked alongside her. Right to the stairwell where he held the door open for her. Jackson left the floor but Bryce followed her in and let the door close. "Bryce?" Jackson asked, wondering what his plan was. In response he kissed her. To Jackson's surprise she kissed him back. She let him put his arms around her and was not surprised when she felt him grip her bare bottom. Partly because she had gripped his, or at least she was gripping the back of his pants. What was she doing, she pondered.<br><br>Jackson sighed when Bryce inserted a finger of that roving hand to confirm that she was getting very wet. Bryce extracted his finger and gently sat Jackson down on the landing then knelt between her legs.<br><br>"It's cold!" Jackson exclaimed as the concrete step touched her bottom.<br><br>"Not for long," Bryce laughed. And he lowered his face to Jackson's pussy, instinctively knowing how to pleasure her. She groaned firstly with general pleasure at the treatment he was giving her and then more urgently as her orgasm approached. Bryce knew just when to stop, with Jackson still heaving from her unexpected buzz, still stretched back with her legs wide open. Bryce stepped back and fiddled with his belt and flies.<br><br>Jackson realised what was coming but still could not break free. She backed away a little and stood up. "Sorry," she mumbled, "I... I can't..." Her voice trailed off as she wondered whether she was trying to convince Bryce or herself. What was wrong with her, she wondered.<br><br>Bryce took the hint. "I understand," he agreed although he didn't. He did his pants back up. "Some other time?" he suggested.<br><br>"Some other time," Jackson agreed. She gently touched his shoulder as she made her way past Bryce to start towards the mezzanine. "Sorry," she concluded, turning to look at him one more time before she was gone. Gee, he's good looking, she mused, and a bit of a gentleman. What is wrong with me?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The mailgirl Jan Stephenson sidled into Shane Crawford's office, a big grin on her face. Shane's mood turned from stressed to pleased when he saw her. The slim, tall blonde played up to Shane's delight and slunk around his desk to run his hands over the front of his chest.<br><br>"What's the matter, you poor man?" she asked, her mouth so close to his ear.<br><br>"This report," he exploded, "I'm supposed to make a presentation about it. Whatever it's about!"<br><br>Jan massaged the man's shoulders. "Isn't that what the BA's are for?" she asked as if she really expected Shane to give that answer rather than her having to provide it.<br><br>Shane sat up promptly. "Yes, you're right," he exclaimed. "Can you go and get one of them for me?"<br><br>Jan smiled because she knew things that Shane did not. "I'd love to, but there's something more urgent for you to deal with. Apparently there's a kerfuffle at ground floor reception and they need you to sort it out. Kind of urgent."<br><br>"Right, so..." Shane started as he got up from his seat, Jan having released him from her massaging. He turned to her like she was a trusted colleague who he needed to do some work for him, not a statuesque naked woman who every so often came into his office, bent over his desk and let him fuck her. "Could you have a look at that report," he asked her, "and get one of the BA's to put together a presentation?"<br><br>"Uh huh," she replied as if she had any alternative.<br><br>Shane was almost out the door when he stopped to attract Jan's attention. She was now sitting at his desk, looking at his screen. "Of course," Shane remembered, "you could do it for me yourself if you have time?" He smiled, she smiled. It actually pumped Jan up a bit. That he did remember her professional ability. That she was more than a naked, attractive body.<br><br>Down on the ground floor, Shane saw a man sitting behind the desk, two security guards and two women all standing at the desk. They all looked glad to see him. And they started talking all at once as he approached.<br><br>"One at a time," Shane urged wearing his boyish smile as he focussed on the most attractive woman out of the group trying for his attention. He knew her. And realised that he should have been ready.<br><br>Rosemary Millwall, the reporter was clearly there for her follow-up mailgirls story, looking striking yet professional in a knee-length conservative dress, already with microphone in hand. Her camera operator this time was an equally pleasant young woman who held her lightweight camera by her side, clearly unsure whether she should be recording the stand-off. Rosemary noticed and snapped "Trisha, get filming!" at her. Trisha obeyed, lifting the camera to her shoulder, focussing on Rosemary who instinctively knew that she had Shane in shot.<br><br>"Shane," Rosemary started although already at full pace, "as you and I agreed I am here at Harada Industries in central Melbourne to report on the mailgirl experience, in the only mailgirl friendly workplace in the Southern Hemisphere. These people," she waved at the security guards and the desk clerk, "have the job to keep unwanted prying eyes away from what goes on inside this otherwise nondescript building. Shane, are you going to escort me in so that I can get the true story, the reality of what goes on up there?"<br><br>Shane took a moment to respond to Rosemary as he had been ogling Trisha who stood solid in a loose fitting sweater and grey slim-fit combat pants as she pointed the camera, her long full wavy hair sweeping back past her shoulders. Rosemary smiled at Shane as if she had chosen the unknowing colleague for that very effect she was having on Shane. He took a breath and nodded to the security staff to confirm that he had this under control. "Come right on up," he smiled over at Rosemary who only needed that confirmation to push her way towards the lift with both Trisha and Shane following.<br><br>"Now, here's how I think we should do it," Rosemary continued without looking to see what Shane's reaction was. But she knew that he was following her. And that Trisha was filming.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Monika Mayhem strode into Stuart Broad's office. He looked up from his computer, to find her breasts right up close, in his eyeline. He lurched away from her. "Did I call a mailgirl?" he snapped.<br><br>Monika rolled her shoulders back, to push her breasts even further forward at him. She happily noted that Stuart had kept his gaze on her. She felt that she had him. "No," she asserted, "you did not call a mailgirl. But Lindsay did. She wants you to look at some figures. And you can look at mine as well." Which he was obviously doing. Until her straightforward comment reminded the uptight American to turn away from the naked woman who stood brazenly exposed in front of him.<br><br>"Do you know what figures she wants?" Stuart asked while trying hard not to look back at Monika. His office was relatively small. It was either her or the roof or the floor. Even Stuart knew that staring back at his screen would be just too rude. Rudeness could have him in front of the mailgirls tribunal, something he recognised would not bode well for him, for his dignity.<br><br>Monika smiled, now in complete control. "I'm not much good about figures. But Lindsay said that she sent you an email about a new project that had a spreadsheet attached to it. Let me have a look." Monika strode around Stuart's desk so that she could look at his screen. Which of course meant that her bare thigh touched Stuart's arm while one of her breasts almost pressed against his cheek. "Can you bring up your emails so I can see if I can see it," Monika asked.<br><br>"Please," Stuart demanded, trying to get away from the mailgirl's intimacy.<br><br>"Please what?" Monika replied blithely. She looked down at Stuart trying to again retreat from her. She realised that of course. "Now that's not very nice," she chided, "after all, you made me do this." She gestured at her bare body, the fact that she was nude in the office. "Are you going to pretend that you didn't hire me because you wanted me to be in here naked with you?"<br><br>Stuart's face seemed to go pale. "I'm married," he spluttered.<br><br>Monika turned to face the manager meaning now that both her breasts were pretty much in his face. "That's not really an answer," she almost unnecessarily pointed out. But she knew where to draw the line, stepping back so that she would not smother him in her bosom. She also realised that the extra distance gave him a better view of her assets. "You don't have to be embarrassed looking at me. I kind of like it." Monika licked her lips. "In fact, I like it a lot!"<br><br>Stuart tried to grab back some control. "Will you let me look for the email!" he exploded. And realised that he had shouted it, far more aggressively than he wanted. Monika watched him, absently scratching an ear which again pushed her breasts more prominently at Stuart. "Sorry," he blurted.<br><br>Monika suddenly changed tack. "Stuart, I want us to be friends. And I want you to know that I appreciate what you did to get me this job here." She smiled. "I didn't expect it. But I never thought that I would like it this much!" She twirled a lock of hair and thought of doing more with her fingers. But she stopped as she noticed that Stuart's look had softened.<br><br>"I'm glad to hear that," Stuart mumbled back.<br><br>Monika stepped back towards the manager. "Stuart, I wouldn't do anything to make you uncomfortable," she smoothed, "so I'm sorry if I did. Let me make it up to you." She stepped behind his seat and leant over to massage his shoulders. "You can pretend that I have clothes on if it helps," she whispered in his ear.<br><br>Monika knew that she was good at relaxing anyone with her sure firm yet tender touch. She could tell that despite his reservations, Stuart was at least physically relaxing under her ministrations. Am I attracted to this man, Monika wondered, why am I doing this? Can it be that I want him to like me, and for him to, I don't know, give me something in return. As Monika pressed her fingers into his shoulders, she watched him scan through his emails trying to find the one she told him to look for.<br><br>Or maybe, Monika wondered, I might just want to fuck up his life. Or at least his fucked up views on how to treat the staff. She trailed one hand down from Stuart's shoulder to past his neck, and through his shirt, she toyed with one of the man's nipples. To her delight Monika did not get any pushback from him. But that was as far as she would go. For now.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jan was doing a stretching routine in the mezzanine together with another mailgirl Annette Kellerman, hands on each other's shoulders as they did their leg swings. Fanny came out from the locker area, nude and refreshed. She smiled at the two of them. "I'll have to try that some time," she joked.<br><br>"Get fit and supple. It's how to get your merit points," Annette told her.<br><br>"Except that we don't get those anymore," Jan reminded them both. "Who's here today?" she asked loosely, "are we all in?"<br><br>"Kimiko's got the day off," Annette reported. She kept track of such things.<br><br>"Again?" Jan noted.<br><br>"Good for her," Annette continued. "We've all got a lot of leave built up. She's just doing something about it."<br><br>At the entrance to the mezzanine, Shane placed a warning hand on Rosemary's arm. That had the desired effect of stopping her barging in on the mailgirls unannounced. Even though or maybe because he stopped her, Rosemary turned and glared at him. "Please," he insisted and took advantage of her pause to slide past her and into the mailgirls' area.<br><br>Shane immediately encountered four of the mailgirls who had all stripped and were waiting for their first assignment of the day. Annette and Pam were still doing their stretching routine while Fanny had now bailed up Jackson, who had emerged from the showers, to regale her with something that both mailgirls found interesting.<br><br>Pam came out the showers having just looked after herself. She straightaway noticed the office number two and smiled at him stretching her thighs apart. "Look Shane, I did it, I'm totally bare down there today. And you're the first to see it all!" She noticed that Shane looked a little apprehensive and jumping to the wrong conclusion, she went up to stroke the man's arm in sympathy. "I know it's only been blow jobs so far, but I promise one day we'll do the whole works," she assured him, quietly.<br><br>"It's not that," Shane responded. "Although that would be nice. Just that..." And here he raised his voice so hopefully all the mailgirls could hear him, "...we have a visitor. Sorry I didn't give you more notice."<br><br>At which point, Rosemary strode in, brushing past Shane in a clear attempt to dominate the room. "It's not his fault. I didn't tell him that I would be coming today." While she spoke, Trisha pushed further into the room, determined to record Rosemary's introduction speech front on. Rosemary looked around. "I think I know some of you," she continued, "and those I don't, I promise that we're going to have some fun today. Not just treat me as if I was one of you." And as she said that, Rosemary lifted her dress to reveal that she was naked underneath, ready to become one of them.<br><br>Annette loomed over at Jackson, as Rosemary now naked looked for somewhere to leave her clothing. "I can't believe it," Annette called out to Jackson, "can she do that?"<br><br>Jackson shrugged back at Annette. "Evidently she can," Jackson told Annette, pointing out the obvious, that no one was going to tell Rosemary to put her clothes back on.<br><br>"So what do we do now, girls?" Rosemary asked, carefully standing a little way away from the actual mailgirls. Trisha was busy getting reaction shots, swinging from Rosemary to the group who were warily watching her.<br><br>None of them said anything for a while. Pam looked around and decided that she should be the polite one. "We wait," she told Rosemary gently. Rosemary looked surprised. "Well," Pam continued, "they'll call us when they need us. Meanwhile we've all got things to keep us busy while we wait."<br><br>Lauryn Mark strode in, still in her street clothes.<br><br>"Nice of you to turn up," Annette taunted her.<br><br>Lauryn looked around and realised that they had an interloper. "What is she doing here?" she asked the group. No one responded. "Shane?" she asked the sole man in there who had stayed amongst the naked women, curious to see what would happen. "And where's Wendy?"<br><br>Under Lindsay's rules, Wendy was supposed to give the mailgirls a morning inspection and judge that they were suitable to go into the office proper.<br><br>At that moment, Wendy came in. "Sorry ladies, I've been in a meeting upstairs." She looked around. "I was going to tell you that we were going to get another visit from the journalist. But I see that horse has bolted."<br><br>Rosemary turned towards the older woman. "And you are?" she asked Wendy, just a little too aggressively.<br><br>Wendy did not flinch. "I am the mailgirls' supervisor. Which means so long as you are here and you're like that, I am responsible for you. So there's a few things that we need to get straight." For whatever reason, Wendy was clearly not going to take any nonsense from anyone today, not least of all Rosemary.<br><br>The girls all stared at the journalist. What was she going to do? Her eyes sharpened as she considered all the ways that she could cut Wendy down to size. Then she softened and looked to the ground. "You're right," Rosemary admitted. "I'm sorry."<br><br>Wendy too softened, especially since she did not enjoy being strict. "That's good," she eased, "I'm sure that we'll all get on."<br><br>Monika strode in. Seeing Shane she smiled at him. "I've been with Stuart," she smirked at him.<br><br>"You didn't??" Shane asked her.<br><br>Monika grinned wide. "More than you'd imagine." Shane gave her a look of surprise. But that could wait. Monika noticed the reporter. "Who are you?" she demanded.<br><br>Pam stepped over to Rosemary and put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "You'll be fine," Pam told the other woman, newly nude, in their midst. "I'll tell you what, you can come on my next assignment with me."<br><br>Rosemary looked genuinely grateful, did not flinch when Pam ran that comforting hand down Rosemary's side. "And you'll be all right with..." Rosemary gestured at Trisha who was standing a few metres away filming her subject's interaction.<br><br>Pam smiled accommodatingly at the camerawoman as she ran that hand gently down Rosemary's hip, this time smiling into the camera. "Of course. After all, that's what you're here for!" Pam looked at her app. "Oh look, we've got one." She smiled at Rosemary like they were now best friends, best nude friends. She looked at the app again. "It's Mitch on level 10! Come on, let's go!" She led the journalist out of the mezzanine.<br><br>As soon as the trio were out of the room, Jackson strode over to Jan. "You didn't did you?" she demanded, with a smirk.<br><br>Jan grinned back. "What do you think?" she responded equally loudly. "I think a visit to Mitch would be perfect for the first run." They may have lost some of their power in the office, but Jan could still hack the booking app.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Rosemary's face was red, and her chest was heaving when she returned to the mezzanine, following the easy strolling Pam who showed only a slight sheen of sweat for her exertions.<br><br>Pam smiled over at Rosemary. "That was fun," she exclaimed. Rosemary apparently did not agree. Or at least she couldn't while she was panting, sucking in large breaths.<br><br>Pam watched carefully as Rosemary took a while to ease down enough to respond. "Well, it was interesting," she gasped. "It's a bit tougher than it looks." She looked around for some camaraderie. She realised that all she got, that all she was likely to get, was a grudging acceptance of her presence. None of the mailgirls smiled at her.<br><br>Jackson spoke up first. "You seem to be pretty critical of us judging from your first report."<br><br>So it was starting, Rosemary realised. "I was just reporting," she offered.<br><br>Jackson did not let up. "Hmm, it seemed to be a bit opinionated," she continued. "It looked a bit like a stereotypical putdown of something that deviates from some imposed norms of behaviour."<br><br>Rosemary bristled. "I've read Nickelled and Dimed. I know all about female repression in the workplace. Are you familiar with that?"<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "Uh, I was a union rep in a majority woman industry before I came here. So I may know a little about it, yes."<br><br>Rosemary tried some charm. "Then we are on the same side. Allies." At that moment, Trisha came back into the room. She also looked exhausted. She was of course clothed, probably overdressed for the workout she had just got. Rosemary noticed, tried to be considerate. "Where did you get to?" she asked her camera operator.<br><br>"I don't think I was prepared for this," Trisha complained. She lifted off her sweater, revealing she only had a sports bra underneath. But that was her limit, she remained dressed amongst the other women who were all naked.<br><br>"You can have a shower if you want," Annette offered.<br><br>Although Trisha was clearly dishevelled and sweating, she shook her head. "I think I'm good," she responded. "Plus," she added looking over at her naked colleague who was sort of surrounded by the mailgirls, "I don't want to miss anything else."<br><br>Jackson smiled at Rosemary. "You weren't coerced to do this?" she asked the reporter.<br><br>Rosemary shook her head. "No, it was my idea. But the producers jumped at it." Jackson looked unconvinced. "I'm sure we'll get it right this time," Rosemary insisted.<br><br>"What did you get wrong last time?" Annette challenged.<br><br>Rosemary sidestepped that. "Look, I've got an interview with Lindsay Davenport in a short while. Let me put it to you. What do you want me to ask her?"<br><br>That stopped the mailgirls' attack. They looked at each other for a short moment while Rosemary relaxed into her new-found authority. "Well..." Pam started. They could all think of questions.<br><br>And at that moment, Monika bustled into the room. "Did I miss anything?" she asked them all.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Rosemary stood bare, waiting near Betty Cuthbert's desk. Betty was, as usual, concentrating on something on her screen, the nature of it hidden from the passing and the waiting traffic that she faced from her desk.<br><br>"You must be busy," Rosemary tried, "with all that responsibility." Trisha panned from Rosemary's face to Betty who seemed to be too preoccupied to acknowledge the naked woman in front of her or to be distracted by the fact that she was being filmed. "You must be busy," Rosemary repeated.<br><br>Eventually Betty looked up at Rosemary who tried not to appear awkward or demanding, just wanting to look relaxed as she stood naked in the middle of an office exposed with Trisha recording all of it. Definitely something that she had never done or even imagined ever doing. Despite having been exposed and seen by so many in the office, she was still uncomfortable, as one would be, and she was certain that she showed it.<br><br>"Oh," said Betty like she had only just realised Rosemary was there. Betty was offhand with Rosemary, letting her sense that she was yet another naked woman in her once normal office. "I'm sorry but she's running late," Betty added without anything in her tone but office politeness. And went back to her work.<br><br>A few moments later, Shane bustled out of Lindsay's office. Lindsay stood back watching him depart. Noticing Rosemary, Shane broke out a wide grin. "Great to see you again," he enthused, "is it all working out?"<br><br>Before Rosemary could think of something appropriate to reply, Lindsay strode out to her. "Come on," she snapped at a startled Rosemary. Shane sensed the change in atmosphere and quickly navigated around Rosemary to get away. Trisha woke up to the change and backed into Lindsay's office ahead of the other two women so she could film them entering, Lindsay striding in with Rosemary uncharacteristically walking meekly behind her.<br><br>Lindsay closed the door behind the three of them. "This will be a bit different to last time," she smiled, looking Rosemary up and down. She then looked into the camera. "Now," she wondered out loud, "how should we conduct this interview?" She thought for a moment. "Why don't you be a mailgirl while we chat, since you already look like one?"<br><br>Rosemary stood facing Lindsay. "What do you mean?" she responded, unsure.<br><br>Lindsay smiled benevolently. "You have seen the videos, you know how mailgirls are expected to behave. Why don't you get on your knees, that position?"<br><br>Rosemary initially experienced outrage. She looked to Trisha for support, but sensed that Trisha was going to revel in watching — and recording — the powerful reporter in that humiliating pose. Why am I doing this, she thought for a fleeting moment. But instead she politely asked Lindsay "what are you thinking?"<br><br>Lindsay looked nonchalant as the well-known woman naked and alone, faced her, waiting. "A mailgirl should be on her knees," she suggested calmly.<br><br>Rosemary had one last thought of rebellion but realised that obeying would give her a fuller mailgirl experience. So she knelt on the carpet facing Lindsay. "Legs a bit wider," Lindsay advised then smiled as the reporter obeyed. So Lindsay continued. "Back straight, breasts thrust out!" she ordered, now into the role, more strident. Rosemary felt humbled, the effect of her blatant exposure, something she had rarely done in private with her lovers. And then she realised something.<br><br>"I haven't seen any mailgirls do anything like this in your office," she told Lindsay.<br><br>"No," Lindsay agreed, "they are not very disciplined."<br><br>Which was not the answer Rosemary was hoping for. But it raised a question. "Is that something you would like to change?" she asked, realising that Lindsay was enjoying her exposure, the way her breasts protruded and the semi-obscured secrets of her crotch. Yes, she privately admitted, it was turning her on too. For a moment she forgot that Trisha was filming her total subjugation. Whether or not it could go to air — probably not — this was a visual record, something to work out in the future.<br><br>"You have been very helpful," Lindsay told her, guiding the narrative her way, "your experience today is the pilot of our new mailgirl intern program."<br><br>Rosemary nodded. "How is that going to work?" she asked, regardless. She wanted facts. Maybe this was the story.<br><br>"I am hoping that you can assist with this new initiative. Now I'd like to think that you can attest to the positivity of the mailgirl experience." Lindsay wanted to reach down and caress the woman in front of her, maybe confirm how turned on she was — Rosemary certainly looked like she needed that sort of relief. But Lindsay held back, kept her hands to herself. Maybe it would be fun to see how far she could push things. "We're yet to finalise all the details," she dissembled, "but this a service we will provide for the curious to see if they have what it takes to be a mailgirl. In the confines of this safe environment. Now I know it's not for everyone," Lindsay concluded, "but some will find out that they need the experience."<br><br>Kneeling and exposed in front of the manager of Harada Industries in Australia, Rosemary, the uptight and usually immaculately dressed popular reporter, wondered if she needed it, if her mailgirl experience had unleashed something in her, something she could enjoy so much, that she would find it hard to ignore. She had stopped caring — or even noticing — how intimately Trisha was filming her experience.<br><br>"I think that will do for the time being," Lindsay announced. "I have another meeting in a short while." She studied Rosemary closely for a moment as the reporter maintained her exposed kneeling pose. "We're finished," Lindsay told her sharply. She enjoyed watching the clearly distracted reporter realise what she had been doing as she stood back up slightly stiff and somewhat unsure of herself. Trisha caught it all.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Les D'Arcy, the IT Manager, was not at his desk. Jackson asked around but no one could tell her where he had gone. As it was still lunchtime, Jackson decided the next best place to find him was the lunchroom. So she took the stairs from the tenth floor to the eighth and strode in amongst the lunching workers there. She scanned the occupants but none seemed to be Les. Perhaps he had gone out and not told anyone. Jackson wondered where else he may be when she noticed that over in a corner Mitch was sitting by himself. She tapped the status of her Les search into her app and then strode over to see her former boss.<br><br>"Have you seen the reporter?" she asked as she sat down opposite him. No point asking him about Les.<br><br>Mitch smiled. "Ah, so that's what the fuss is about. I wonder where she is?" Mitch gave Jackson a smile that suggested he was preoccupied. "What brings you in here?"<br><br>Which gave Jackson a jolt, the realisation that no one else in the room seemed daunted that she was there naked amongst them while they did their lunchtime things. She told Mitch that she was looking for the IT Manager.<br><br>"Can't help you," Mitch stated, as she expected. He looked at his watch. "Sorry," he announced as he stood up, "I have an out of office appointment."<br><br>Jackson nodded as Mitch left her. She did not watch him closely enough to see that he was texting Kimiko to confirm that she would be waiting for him as they had planned. Rather, Jackson got up still scanning the room. She realised that she was right near Bryce at the same moment he noticed her, just as she set off for the exit having decided to check if Les was downstairs with the MAD people who were still contracting their IT services to Harada.<br><br>"Now I keep running into you everywhere," Jackson joked as Bryce stood there, right next to her.<br><br>"Coincidence." Bryce approached Jackson. He got very close, for an intimate conversation. "Sorry about the other day," he told her.<br><br>Jackson gave him a wry smile. "What for?"<br><br>Bryce dissembled. "You know..."<br><br>Jackson got a bit warmer towards him. "It was nice," she admitted.<br><br>That brightened Bryce up. "A repeat?" he asked with a grin.<br><br>"Well, maybe." But Jackson found her thoughts wandering to Mitch rather than this younger attractive man who was clearly interested in her. And oh, so close.<br><br>Bryce noticed. He stiffened a bit. "It's him, isn't it? The guy that you were just talking to."<br><br>Jackson said nothing. But it was clear to both of them that he was correct. Jackson went out to the stairs to continue her search for Les alone. She quietly cursed. What was wrong with her? Why shouldn't she just do what she wanted with Bryce?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Rosemary reckoned that as a journalist she was a pretty good judge of character. She took quick stock of who was present on the mezzanine after Pam and her returned, fresh and sweaty from delivering a message from the engineers to HR. Neither Jackson or Fanny were present, so Rosemary felt that she could better find out what the other mailgirls felt about things without their leaders present. And their supervisor was away too. Rosemary checked that Trisha was still filming. She was energised again, the humiliation session with Lindsay was already long behind her. She could deal with the footage of it later.<br><br>Rosemary told the mailgirls on the mezzanine, Annette, Lauryn and Pam, that she would like to speak to them. They gathered around her. She looked over at the display chairs. "Would it be more comfortable if we sat?" she suggested.<br><br>The mailgirls looked to each other, then looked again at the row of display chairs. Pam spoke up. "How is that going to work?" she asked.<br><br>"Watch," smiled Rosemary who went over to one of the display chairs, bent down to unclick it at the base then shifted it over to face the other chairs. She smiled at Pam and then at the others. "Oh, you didn't know that they could do that?" she asked.<br><br>This meant that Rosemary could face the others although she was on display, pussy open to the three of them who all sat pussy open facing her. They waited to see what she was thinking.<br><br>"Well," Rosemary started, "clearly we have nothing to hide from each other."<br><br>"So what are you here for?" Pam asked the journalist.<br><br>Rosemary took a breath. "This is a serious experiment in human interrelations, and I am taking it very seriously as a story that needs to be told. That is what serious journalism does."<br><br>Lauryn was not convinced. She asked Rosemary: "do you really think that what you do is journalism?"<br><br>Rosemary shot back at her: "Do you really think that what you do is office work?"<br><br>Lauryn brushed off the insult. Since it would not matter to her soon anyway. "What I meant was that last time you took to cheap sensationalism about what is going on here, you made the story as salacious as possible. There was no nuance, no real investigation."<br><br>Rosemary was not flustered either. "But don't you think that is a function of what is going on here? Most people when confronted by an attractive naked woman..." she started.<br><br>"You're ignoring how this place works," Lauryn snapped back.<br><br>Until then Annette had stayed silent. But now she gave Lauryn and Pam a serious look. "Girls, we're not like that. That's not who we are."<br><br>Jan wandered in from her errand at that moment. "What are we like?" she asked. "And how did the chairs end up like this?"<br><br>No one said anything for a moment. Then Lauryn spoke up. "I was being, I guess, unfriendly to our visitor." She looked over to Rosemary who stayed neutral. "I'm sorry," Lauryn admitted.<br><br>That changed Rosemary who smiled benevolently at Lauryn. "You don't have to worry about that. I don't mind being challenged, a bit of robust discussion. But you're right. I was very superficial last time. This time I'm trying to get a feel of what really goes on here. Hence this." She gestured at her own exposure. Lauryn was unimpressed but she sensed the others were more forgiving, so she let it rest.<br><br>"So how does it feel?" Jan asked Rosemary.<br><br>She thought for a moment. "I feel free. There is a lot of release in doing this without any clothes on, I didn't expect that."<br><br>Jan nodded. "Have you spoken to Fanny? She'll be interested for her research."<br><br>"Research?" Rosemary asked.<br><br>Jan backtracked. "Well, she is researching something. Better you ask her." What would Fanny want me to say, Jan wondered. Did I already say too much? Does she want to get involved?<br><br>Annette stood up and went over to Rosemary, gesturing that she should stand too. She obeyed and Annette reached forward and hugged her. She then turned to Lauryn. "Your turn," she insisted.<br><br>"I'm sorry," Lauryn told the reporter as she stood up and approached her as Annette let go, "this is odd. I've never ever felt bitchy to any of you others. Solidarity in nudity or something. But Rosemary brought out something in me, I don't know..."<br><br>"We want her to see the good side of us," Annette told the other mailgirl. And rather than have Lauryn step in, Annette grabbed Rosemary by the waist again.<br><br>Lauryn returned to her seat, unimpressed. "But I guess it's natural even for you given how she treated you when she had clothes on."<br><br>Annette still held Rosemary in her arms and gave her a warm, accommodating look. Then she glanced over at Lauryn. "But that shouldn't count now that she's one of us, even for a day or however long she's here. She's one of us now walking around delivering messages without any of her assertiveness clothes on."<br><br>Lauryn held her attitude. "I don't know if we can just dismiss what she did last time," she told Annette as the others watched on. "But I know, you want to be nice to everyone, that's your nature. So I guess we'll just have to differ on that."<br><br>Trisha swung the camera between the protagonists, hoping that the footage could be useful. But Annette said nothing back since she realised that there was nothing that she needed to say. Rosemary seemed to have learnt a lesson and kept quiet, happy to let the others talk out as they chose.<br><br>Annette released Rosemary from her embrace but instead she firmly held her hand. "Come on," she told their visitor, "let's get you cleaned up!" And she led Rosemary into the showers. And turned to smile at the other mailgirls as she fondled the reporter's bottom to her evident pleasure.<br><br>Trisha made to follow them. Pam grabbed her by the hand and smiled. "This time I don't think so," she instructed the camera operator who accepted that boundary and did not try to evade Pam's clutches.<br><br>Jackson came back into the mailgirls' room, noticing that only Jan, Pam and Lauryn were there. Trisha was sitting at Wendy's desk reviewing her footage. "We've been a bit harsh on Rosemary," Jackson told them, "I guess we should make her feel welcome."<br><br>Annette came out of the shower area, leading a relaxed Rosemary, giggling. "I already did!" she exclaimed.<br><br>Pam looked at her app and then to Rosemary. "We have another call out," she told the reporter. "And they specifically asked for you. Are you ready?"<br><br>Rosemary nodded, realising that saying no was not an option. The mailgirl's fate.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Towards the end of the day, Fanny approached Rosemary while she was recovering from another callout, back down in the mezzanine. Rosemary reclined on one of the display seats, looking worn out. She had dismissed Trisha who had reluctantly departed. Annette and Pam had parked themselves on seats a short distance away and both were engrossed in whatever was on their laptops. Fanny dragged the chair that Rosemary had earlier liberated over to face the reporter, quite clearly intent on a conversation. Their knees were almost touching. "Do you like my breasts?" Fanny asked the other naked woman as she reclined back in her chair, her large breasts barely drooping, in other words they were pointing straight at Rosemary.<br><br>The reporter could hardly ignore Fanny's display. "They're very, um, noticeable," Rosemary managed.<br><br>Fanny showed that she appreciated the response. She toyed with her nipples for a moment then lifted her breasts towards Rosemary who pulled back. Fanny gave her a reassuring look like she knew she had reached a boundary. Then she honed in. "I'd like to interview the interviewer."<br><br>"The other mailgirls told me that you're the world authority," Rosemary replied. "If that's true, maybe first I should interview you."<br><br>Fanny ignored that. "My study, I am trying to learn what makes a mailgirl tick. And I'm fascinated by you, a person who is famous with her clothes on, appearing in millions of homes every night. Yet you turned that on its head and volunteered to strut around here completely naked, delivering messages just like we do."<br><br>"But I'm only doing it for the day," Rosemary complained.<br><br>Fanny was not having any of that. "Are you?" she wondered. "You do seem to be enjoying it. I will wager that one day may not be enough for you?" She gave Rosemary a deep look that seemed to set the reporter onto the defensive. Was Fanny correct? But she was only just starting. "But I think it goes deeper. There you are having made a successful career of playing the cool, prim reporter, always standing aloof from your subjects, immaculately dressed, with your ice-cold authority. Yet look at you at this moment. I've had lovers who have been less exposed to me."<br><br>Rosemary had been reclining back in her seat since it gave her no choice, her legs spread wide, her nicely shaped breasts unobstructed, her nipples hard, and her shoulder-length blonde lightly tickling her shoulders. But Fanny's accusation got a reaction. Rosemary sat up, her breasts prominent and close to Fanny's pair, not the impression she wanted to make. Especially with her legs still wide. But her face hardened, again adopting the ice-coldness which Fanny had described. "You think I'm a freakshow?" Rosemary shot back at her interviewer. Whether she intended it, she was the one being interviewed.<br><br>Fanny feigned to think about that for a moment. "Well actually, yes," she smiled.<br><br>Annette had been listening. She leaned towards the two of them and coughed to attract their attention. Rosemary turned to look at her. "She's the world authority," Annette observed, "if she says you're a freakshow, then you're a freakshow."<br><br>"It's just science," Pam added, not directing her comment at any of the others in particular.<br><br>Rosemary dramatically fell back in her seat. "What do you want of me?" she demanded as she kept staring at Fanny who reached forward to run a hand along the inside of Rosemary's thigh.<br><br>"Shall we start again?" Fanny asked. Rosemary was about to agree when Fanny trailed one of her hands up from thigh to slit, just rippling gently along its length.<br><br>Rosemary of course gasped, then groaned. "I think we should explore your inner mailgirl," Fanny directed as she tightened her control over their visitor. She had not meant to, but the opportunity just came so easily, and she was not going to pass it up. Rosemary was emitting little squeals in response. "Let's begin again," Fanny continued, and got no complaint from Rosemary who now seemed ready to acquiesce to anything Fanny wanted. And of course Fanny knew precisely what she wanted. Her hands were doing the talking.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily and Cara lounged in front of the television in the family games room. Jessica stepped a short way in so she could speak to them. "What's on the tele?" she asked trying to break the ice.<br><br>"No idea," Emily drawled without even turning to acknowledge her mother. She looked over at her twin to see if she knew.<br><br>"It's a show about a guy who runs a business — advertising agency — who keeps cheating on his wife. It's supposed to be a comedy," Cara advised.<br><br>"It's not very funny," Emily chimed in.<br><br>Jessica tried to keep a straight face. "They're going to be over soon. Let's try to act like a happy family okay?"<br><br>Emily laughed.<br><br>"Shane will see through us," Cara suggested.<br><br>"But Holly might not," Jessica tried.<br><br>"Do you think that they talk to each other?" Emily suggested.<br><br>Jessica sighed. "Let's just attempt the bare minimum okay?" she pleaded.<br><br>"Why did you invite them over to this?" Cara wondered.<br><br>Jessica smiled. "I have my reasons." And she left it at that, leaving the twins to their own issues. A short while after, she returned to the games room. The TV was still on, but the girls weren't there. It took her a moment to realise that Mitch was near one of the walls standing still, apparently watching the show that the twins had been talking about.<br><br>"Where are they?" Jessica asked him.<br><br>"Don't know," Mitch admitted. "I came in to see what they were watching and it was empty. The boss in this show is not a very good person," he observed.<br><br>"Imagine that," Jessica snapped back. Mitch gave his wife a suggestive look.<br><br>Jessica shook her head. "Don't think of it, they'll be here soon. Can you check on the kitchen? I need to get myself ready. And when you've done that, can you check on the girls and warn them off if they're plotting anything?" Jessica marched out before Mitch could offer anything to that.<br><br>When Holly and Shane arrived it was just Jessica and Mitch to entertain them. "The girls are here somewhere, they'll be out when they're ready, I guess," Jessica promised.<br><br>"I'm looking forward to when ours are old enough," Holly confessed. Shane smiled.<br><br>"No, you're not," Jessica urged. Mitch looked quizzically at his wife. She shook her head. "They've been a handful," she continued without any further explanation.<br><br>Shane was looking uncomfortable. "Can I use your bathroom?" he asked.<br><br>Mitch gave his former deputy a foreboding looking. "No," Mitch replied. They all laughed.<br><br>"I know where it is," Shane replied ignoring Mitch's jibe and headed out of the room. Coming out of the bathroom he noticed that Emily's door was open and her light was on. He knocked lightly.<br><br>"Just a minute," she responded. After that minute, she opened the door. And saw who it was. "Oh hi, Uncle Shane," she smiled.<br><br>Shane took a step into her room. "Don't call me that!" he laughed like she had insulted him, "I'm surprised to see you here. Stuffy dinner with your father's work colleague."<br><br>"Oh yeah," Emily admitted, "we're just going out."<br><br>Shane gave her a surprised look. "Your parents think you are staying for dinner." They both smiled. Shane raised an eyebrow. "Before you go, you should know that I have seen you naked."<br><br>Emily shrugged. "Oh, no big deal. Everybody has." She did not appear to be at all concerned at what Shane was hinting.<br><br>Shane got serious. "I doubt that."<br><br>Emily smiled brightly. "Well maybe not everybody. So?"<br><br>Shane explained the video that the journalist had given him. The university protest.<br><br>"Are you sure it was me?" Emily slyly asked, suggesting she expected that it was.<br><br>Shane nodded. "Pretty obvious. I recognised you straight away. And I've only ever seen you with your clothes on. Does that make me one of the few unlucky ones?"<br><br>Emily got a little serious. "How do we keep it quiet?" She realised that she had not checked since the night of the mailgirls current affairs show when the view count was 314. She assumed that no one had seen it. But was Shane suggesting it was now viral?<br><br>Shane looked her over then smiled his enticing smile. "Ways of keeping it quiet," he wondered. He even scratched his chin. "Well..." He stepped into her room and closed the door.<br><br>Emily shrugged. "Maybe this will help." She got down on her knees in front of Shane and unzipped his pants. She smiled up at Shane.<br><br>"I don't know," he stumbled.<br><br>Emily licked the length of his cock, wanking it to confirm he was fully hard. "Of course you know," she corrected and took him straight into her mouth.<br><br>It was only a moment before Cara burst in. "Are you ready Em?" she started before grokking the scene in front of her. "What? You're blowing Uncle Shane?!" she exclaimed.<br><br>Shane smiled almost apologetically at Cara. Emily took him out of her mouth and looked to her sister. "I can explain," she told Cara.<br><br>Cara wasn't impressed. "Who to?" she replied.<br><br>Shane tried to ease the issue. "It's not what it seems..." he started.<br><br>Cara gave him her look. "Really? Well you two continue then and I'll try to work out what it is then. But if you could hurry up, Em. Our Uber's booked for fifteen minutes." Cara shut the door behind her and stood there watching them with her arms crossed.<br><br>Emily smiled at Cara, still on her knees, slowly wanking Shane. "Okay, I'll try," she said. She leaned forward, taking Shane in her mouth again.<br><br>Cara, although surprised at her sister's behaviour, tried not to show it. "I didn't think he was your type. No offence Uncle Shane," she drawled.<br><br>"Can you not call me that?" Shane tried.<br><br>"Sure, Uncle Shane," Cara smirked.<br><br>Emily took him out of her mouth for a moment. "Uncle Shane is kind of cute," she offered. He rolled his eyes.<br><br>Cara still appeared not impressed. "If you say so." She looked to Shane. "Can you please focus and concentrate on cumming in my sister's mouth?" She pointed at her wrist, reminding him of the time. Shane took the hint and thrust meaningfully into Emily's mouth as she clamped her lips around him. That worked, Shane jerked a few hard gasps. Emily swallowed. She almost managed to swallow the lot.<br><br>Emily wiped some cum off her chin: "It's blackmail," she told her sister. Shane, zipping up his pants, did not react.<br><br>Cara did react though. She nodded. "That's more like it! Em explain!"<br><br>"Well," Emily started, "Uncle Shane reckons he has a video of me in the nude. Being a mailgirl, he says."<br><br>Cara crossed her arms. "Well, that's absurd! The only mailgirls in Australia are in Uncle Shane's office, aren't they?" She smiled dangerously at the man in the room. "But I think the blackmail shoe is on the other foot now, Uncle Shane. There's a few things that you can do for us to keep this little episode secret."<br><br>Shane smiled calmly. "I could deny everything."<br><br>Cara held up her smartphone. "Do you know what this button on a phone does? Let me show what you were doing a moment ago." She offered to share but Shane shook his head. He was well aware of what he had just done and what Cara might do. "So do we have a deal?" Cara asked him. But they all knew the answer to that question. Emily licked her lips. Now they just had to work out the details.<br><br>`

                    content: `Cara sat on Emily's bed shaking her head in disbelief. "I can't... I don't believe that you were just blowing Uncle Shane."<br><br>Emily smiled. "A bit of a laugh. And the parents were entertaining Aunt Holly while we were in here. I think that ticks off a few of my fantasies." She was pretty chilled. She mimed her sucking face. The twins broke into laughter.<br><br>Their giggles were silenced by a knock at the door. Their mother Jessica called out whether she could come in. Both girls called back Yes, so she opened it. "Good to see you're not in bed," their mother drily observed.<br><br>"No, you can see that we're just about ready," Cara stated gesturing that they were indeed dressed and presentable. In fact, a little too presentable. They both wore little black numbers that showed off a lot of leg.<br><br>"Are you two planning to go out?" Jessica asked. They were clearly overdressed for a home dinner.<br><br>"What, and leave you four to discuss serious adult things?" Emily taunted back. "The thought never entered our heads!"<br><br>"Except that is exactly what we are going to do," Cara confirmed.<br><br>Jessica shook her head at her daughters. "Dinner's almost served. You can eat first. And don't say you're not hungry. I don't want to hear that you've already been snacking. And you've got Uni tomorrow."<br><br>Cara smirked at her mother. "I haven't eaten anything." She looked over at Emily. "But I'm not going to answer for her. What she might have been eating."<br><br>Jessica tried to be motherly with Emily. "You don't have to be like your sister, you know."<br><br>Cara challenged Emily. "If you've already eaten you can say." Not getting an answer, she looked to Jessica. "I can only imagine what she might have put in her mouth," she flatly related. While enjoying Emily just managing to keep a straight face. But they followed Jessica out of Emily's bedroom. Sure that their mother could not see, Emily punched Cara on the arm. But all she got back was a wide smile.<br><br>"Go and be nice to your dad and to Shane," Jessica suggested offhandedly to the twins as she veered towards the kitchen. Cara punched Emily back as both of them tried not to crack up. What your parents don't know...<br><br>"So did you do anything to the reporter?" Mitch asked Shane as the twins joined them in the dining room.<br><br>Cara had clearly heard her father. "What's this about? What did you do to the reporter?" she asked Shane, getting embarrassed looks from both the men. "And where's Aunty Holly?" she noted.<br><br>That lowered the temperature. "She's looking after the dinner while Jessica was chasing you two. I thought you had gone out," Shane deflected avoiding Emily by looking to Mitch.<br><br>"And the reporter?" Emily insisted. She went over to shake Shane's arm like she really needed to know. Mitch gave Shane a look that suggested he was on his own. Shane kept his gaze on Mitch, trying not to look at Emily who was now stroking his arm.<br><br>Shane ignored Emily, just shrugged. "She came back." They all looked at him. "The current affairs segment," he explained. "I'm assuming you watched the current affairs piece on our mailgirls." Having regained some control he looked at each of the twins. Both nodded, of course they had. "Well," Shane revealed, "she came back and played at being a mailgirl for a day."<br><br>Emily looked hard at Shane. "That sucks!" she exclaimed. But at that moment Jessica and Holly came in with entrees, saving Shane from further excruciation. Fortunately for him, dinner progressed at a civilised level, with the twins taking turns to tease Shane about now being Mitch's boss instead of the other was around. Mailgirls were not mentioned.<br><br>"Do you want to be the head in the office," Emily asked Shane slyly, emphasising the word 'head' of course. Shane of course denied any ambition there.<br><br>Before they had quite finished their mains, Cara put down her fork and looked across the table at Emily. "Our Uber is here." She looked over to her mother who seemed resigned to it. At least they had presented as a normal family for some while. Despite Mitch's admission to them about his office affair with mailgirl Kimiko Date. Jessica had decided on appearing that all was fine, and the twins leaving before the end of the meal played to that. Cara looked to their guests as she and Emily stood up, adjusting their dresses down since they had ridden up a little. "See you Uncle Shane, Aunty Holly," the twins intoned.<br><br>Shane looked hard back at them. "You have a better offer than dinner with us old folk?" he replied amicably.<br><br>Emily smiled at him. "I've eaten enough. Not that hungry now." She held that smile while Shane tried to keep a straight face.<br><br>In the backseat of the Uber, Cara shook her head at her sister. "I can't believe you did that," she marvelled.<br><br>Emily gave her a wide-eyed look. "I can't believe you filmed it. Anyway, it was fun. A man in my bedroom. The chance of getting caught. Let me tell you it was a turn on. I'll bet you wanted to."<br><br>Cara shook her head. "I don't think so. Old man."<br><br>Emily smiled. "He's not that old. And he's still got it." She licked her lips.<br><br>"And what about Aunty Holly?" Cara retorted.<br><br>Emily held her innocent smile. "Well, there was no resistance. Uncle Shane sure didn't hesitate or hold back. Almost like he expected it. I'm going out on a limb here, I don't think it was the first time he did something like that. There's something about that man." She slouched on the seat and somewhat exposed, reached down between her legs.<br><br>Cara realised what her sister was doing. "You're not wearing pants!" Cara exclaimed. That was pretty evident. Emily played with her exposed slit, legs spread. "You were sitting at dinner..." Cara continued, realising. With a look of disbelief.<br><br>Emily looked over at her sister. "And I guess you are?" she challenged. Cara shuffled in her place and hiked her skirt enough to show that she was. Emily smiled as she kept fingering herself. "Take them off," she suggested.<br><br>"I'm glad we're going to Carringbush." Cara sighed as she complied. But she patted her dress back down. "Self restraint," she advised her sister.<br><br>"Never heard of that," Emily laughed back as she kept wanking herself. "I should check if you're wearing a bra." Fortunately her phone pinged. So she stopped to have a look. "Haha," she smiled, "it's Uncle Shane." Cara looked interested. "He's asking me if it's okay to sext me. I'll tell him no with an eggplant thingy." As she hit send.<br><br>Cara rolled her eyes. "That will do it."<br><br>Emily started at her phone. "Oh look, he did reply. 'I'm still wet down there thanks to you.' I wonder where he's texting from?"<br><br>"I can only guess he's got away from the others for a bit," Cara suggested.<br><br>"Just as likely to be still sitting at the table, I reckon. A reply." Emily thought for a moment. "I know. 'Is your vagina wet?' That ought to do it." Emily typed.<br><br>"Do what?" Cara asked.<br><br>Emily shook her head at her sister's naivety as she saw it. "Get a response, silly. And here it is. 'Is yours?' he asked. That's not very nice. 'Of course not. Sucking you off did not get me hard.' Confusing enough?" she asked her sister.<br><br>Cara shook her head. "Just as well we're here," she commented as the Uber stopped in the carpark of the massage parlour.<br><br>"I'm not judging," the Uber driver started.<br><br>Cara cut him off. "Then don't," she snapped and ended it right there as the sisters got out and went up to the front entrance.<br><br>Inside they were met by the typically stone-faced receptionist who told them that Destinee was busy. "Got someone else available, just as good," the receptionist drawled. Before the twins could complain a short busty woman appeared in reception from down the hall.<br><br>"I'm Prudence," she announced with a wink. Her full firm bust was on display through a sheer top. "Which of you is it?" she asked.<br><br>Emily took control. "Both of us. We wanted Destinee. She knows what we like."<br><br>Prudence smiled as she assessed their state. "I can probably work that out, you know." It was pretty obvious that they were both already halfway turned on.<br><br>Cara nodded at Emily then at Prudence, and they followed the short blonde down the hall and into her room. "Only one bed," Cara noted, critical.<br><br>"It is a double," Prudence replied. "There's a couch," she informed the clients as she lifted off her top and slipped out of her wraparound skirt. "Now, who's first?" Cara was not surprised that Emily already had her dress up over her head. She feigned surprise that the dress was all that Emily was wearing.<br><br>Cara sat back on the couch, remaining dressed as she watched Prudence lead Emily to the bed and position her on all fours as she went down on her. Emily was right into it straight away, as Prudence expected and Cara knew, having already got herself into a state on the way there. Cara though felt somewhat detached. But she was happy for the moment to just watch her twin enjoying herself. After a time, Prudence turned to Cara who was just reclining back where she sat, comfortable. Emily had curled up on the bed in a post cumming bliss.<br><br>"Your turn now?" she asked Cara as she got up and took a few steps towards her.<br><br>Cara sat thinking for a moment, staring at the attractive naked blonde. "No, I'm good," she decided. But, she was wondering, why don't I feel any need or desire. Why not? Something was up, she decided, and she was not sure what it was.<br><br>Emily looked up from the bed, bleary-eyed but aware. "That's all right," she breathed, "more for me." As she looked dreamily at Prudence who picked up her vibe and returned to the bed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>June Lockhart sat at her desk in the HR team concentrating on a document in front of her when Martin ambled in, humming along with whatever was coming through his headphones. He took them off and smiled at June. "Am I allowed to say that it's good to see you back in clothes again?" he tried, somewhere between light mockery and compassion.<br><br>June looked up and sort of nodded then went back to concentrating on what was in front of her. "Contract?" Martin asked her. She looked vaguely at him and nodded, as curtly as before. But this time she stared into space. Martin realised. "Oh, that contract," he confirmed as he sat down at his desk and he faced his HR colleague. "Have you decided yet?" he asked her.<br><br>June summoned the strength to talk to Martin directly about her situation. "It's the details in the contract. And then there's the reality of actually doing it. Actually choosing to leave this..." She gestured at the normality of their surroundings. "...and dropping my career to get paid for wandering naked around the office."<br><br>"The money?" Martin wondered.<br><br>June stared back. "The money doesn't really come into it. Well, it's a raise and it will be nice. But..."<br><br>"What have you got to lose?" Martin wondered.<br><br>June was slightly admonishing. "That's easy for you to say."<br><br>Martin did not dodge that. "True. But what is the real sticking point. Will you enjoy it?"<br><br>June thought on that for a moment. "Well the mailgirls seem to enjoy it."<br><br>Martin looked askance. Had she been paying attention, seen what they got up to? "I think they more than enjoy it."<br><br>June thought for another moment. They enjoyed it? Of course they enjoyed it. Snap. Suddenly she lifted her dress over her head, folded it, and placed it to the side on her desk. Just as efficiently she unsnapped her bra and slid her pants down her legs, placing them both on top of the dress. Naked, she went back to the contract, flipped over the page to read the next one. Martin wondered was that his doing? He decided that he better not say anything more. Fortunately he could think of nothing appropriate anyway. June smiled straight at her close colleague but it was the smile of a stranger. Evidently she was already casting off.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Belinda Clarke, the head of HR sat at the head of the boardroom table. "We seem to have quite a few here for this tribunal," she noted. "Let's go around the room, so you can explain why you're here. I'll start. As head of HR, I chair these sessions, according to the regulations. So I'll be making sure things run as they should." She looked to her left.<br><br>"I'm Stuart Broad. As Operations Manager, I'm keeping an eye on things from a management perspective. Let me just say that this doesn't happen in the States." A recent arrival from Harada's American office he was still out of place in Melbourne, and he knew it.<br><br>He looked to his left. The younger engineer smirked at him. Then he gave Belinda a serious look. "I'm Brian Taber, an engineer. I guess I'm the reason we are all here. Something I said to Lauryn." He glanced quickly at the mailgirl then looked away. "I'm here to find out why the mailgirls called for this tribunal, to understand why they are upset at me. And to see, I guess, what can be done in the future." He looked over to his left. "I've brought a friend along for support, like I was told the rules let me." He looked to Belinda again. "I like working here," he told her. Then he looked to his friend again.<br><br>The friend to his left spoke up, addressing no one in particular. "I'm Bryce. Like he said, I'm his friend, here for support." Both men appeared sincere. Bryce looked hopefully at the door as if he was waiting for someone he knew to enter.<br><br>There was a pause after Bryce. Belinda looked straight down to the other end of the table. Lauryn Marks sat there, away from the others, looking alert. She glanced at the shibaru styled prints on the boardroom wall then looked straight at Belinda. She got the hint and started talking. "I'm a mailgirl, obviously." Obvious because she was naked. "We're here because I have a few things to say to Brian Taber."<br><br>Belinda gave Lauryn a supportive smile. "I understand that it can't be easy for you to do this, Lauryn. So I'd like to thank you for your courage in coming here. And also you, Brian, for your courage in coming too." Belinda looked at the closed door. "I was expecting Jackson to attend too. She was to be here both as a coordinator of the tribunal and as Lauryn's chosen friend. Hopefully she'll be along soon. But in the meantime, I'll give an explanation of why we are here and how I expect things to proceed." She paused for a moment as if Jackson would dramatically enter and take this burden off her hands. It did not not happen. So she continued. Belinda explained that mailgirls used the tribunal for minor complaints like misunderstandings where they felt that the fabrics' behaviour could be improved by sitting around a table and discussing it. For issues that needed to be raised but could be resolved amicably.<br><br>"Very touchy-feely," Stuart muttered.<br><br>Belinda gave him a warning look. "No, it's the opposite, Stuart," she corrected. Then looking to the mailgirl at the other end of the table, she asked her if she felt comfortable explaining why she had asked for the session.<br><br>Lauryn nodded and stood up at the other end of the room, facing the others while also looking down at her laptop to check her notes. She looked back up and realised that everyone was watching her, waiting. She quickly looked back down at her notes again. For some reason, Lauryn suddenly felt more naked than she had for a long time. This is ridiculous, she tried to rationalise, I have been naked like this before. I'm always naked. What is doing this to me?<br><br>She realised that she needed to say something, rather than just stand there exposed to the others in the room, framed by those large prints of bound, naked women, pictures that seemed to her to reflect the situation that she was in, one that she would soon no longer have to endure. Since she was working out her notice.<br><br>She had their attention, at least. Lauryn cleared her throat. She stopped for a moment when Mick Doohan, the young engineers' boss came into the room apologising for being late and quickly introducing himself. Mick sat down by Lauryn's side apparently unconcerned that she was nude. She nodded at him then continued. "I know that since mailgirls have now been here for a while, you might take having naked women here in this office for granted now. You may have decided that our being here naked infers a certain lax attitude on our part..." Gah, did I really write this, she wondered. But she looked around the room and since she still had the serious attention of everyone there, she continued, feeling more confident.<br><br>"But we have limits. And it is... it should be pretty obvious where those limits are." She decided to lean into her performance and stepped back from the table to stand, legs astride, purposely fully displaying herself to the others. Lauryn felt a thrill from that exhibitionism. Perhaps she will miss it when she is no longer a mailgirl? Well, soak it up while she can.<br><br>Lauryn stopped to view her audience. Stuart was pretending not to notice. Mick stared up at her viewing her like he was solving an equation or something. She was impressed that this man who could easily reach over to grip her in the most intimate way was showing no lust for her at all although he was so close she could feel his breath on her thigh. She looked to the other end of the room. Bryce was affecting a distant curiosity about the whole thing. And Brian was acting unsure. After all, he was the one being censured and he was patently uncertain at how he should react to Lauryn's blatant display. However, Lauryn found it curious that Belinda was starting at her admiringly. What, she wondered, did that mean?<br><br>Regardless she had more to say. "The mailgirls here should expect a certain level of respect. The reason we are here in this room is because the company is obliged to provide a safe environment for all its workers, to be treated with dignity and..."<br><br>"That's baloney!" Stuart interrupted. Lauryn stared at him, like what are you on about? The others seemed equally shocked.<br><br>"Do you wish to expand on that?" Belinda asked the manager keeping her voice controlled and calm, only just.<br><br>"Look at her standing there like that!" he blurted.<br><br>Belinda feigned total unknowing. "Like what?" she asked in the same calm tone. Lauryn stared bemused, happy for the head of HR to play it out. Brian felt a little relaxed, feeling that Stuart was about to make any transgression of his pale compared to where Stuart seemed to be going with his outburst. Mick looked like he had not heard anything Stuart had said.<br><br>Stuart missed any warning from the others' approach. "Standing there like that! Wanton!" He shook his head on behalf of all the other fabrics in the room. Then he stared hard at Belinda. "And you should know better!"<br><br>Belinda waited for a moment. Then she spoke carefully. "Let's get this back on track," she suggested in her still barely calm voice. She was not going to take Stuart's bait. She looked around happy to see all mouths shut, happy that no one else was going to go there either.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson checked her phone to see who was calling her. Since it was her friend she decided she should take it.<br><br>Charlotte started in on her straight away. "You're naked there, at the moment, aren't you?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Well, yes," she sighed. "It's my job."<br><br>That seemed to amuse Charlotte. She chuckled. "What are you doing at this moment?" she demanded.<br><br>Jackson looked around the mezzanine. She was the only mailgirl there. Wendy was at her desk apparently engrossed in whatever was on her screen. So Jackson had a little privacy. "Believe it or not," she reported to her friend, "I have to go to a meeting now to explain to some men that they need to treat us with respect."<br><br>"Really?" Charlotte asked. "That sounds, uh, interesting."<br><br>Jackson needed to end the call there. "Oh, I'm going to have a wank beforehand. Takes the edge off," she reported. Well, why not? She could find out what effect their conversation was having on her friend later. "See ya!" Jackson laughed and call ended. She sat back and spread her legs. And thought about how good it had been to have Bryce down there. He was almost as good as what she was doing to herself.<br><br>After her moment, Jackson went up to the boardroom. "Sorry I'm late," she smiled, "did I miss anything?" as she swung through the door. Everyone was silent, regrouping from Stuart's outburst.<br><br>Belinda enjoyed the change of atmosphere that Jackson's entrance caused. But she also sensed that this was not the Jackson that she knew. Belinda studied Jackson as she sat down daintily on the other side of Lauryn, but she could not quite spot the change. She did not notice Jackson's swoon on realising that Bryce was there in the room. Why should she? Belinda did not know Bryce and of course had no knowledge of what had been going on between Jackson and him.<br><br>To regain her authority, Belinda decided she could derail Stuart's involvement with a recap, ostensibly for Jackson's benefit. She addressed Brian. "Lauryn felt uncomfortable with your attention to her. And she told you that was the case. But you felt that she was joking, that was the impression that she gave you. Do you agree with that as a basic statement of what happened?"<br><br>Brian chose to say nothing to that. He made the briefest of eye contact with Belinda when she paused and then gave the impression that he was seriously considering what she had said.<br><br>But Stuart spoke up again. "I'm still not happy. It sounds to me like we are policing and regulating normal office banter."<br><br>Belinda looked incredulously at Stuart for a moment. She waited for him to go on. That way she might tell how serious he was. But he shut up after his brief outburst, like he was sure that he had said all that he needed to. So she tried. "Does anyone else see this situation that way?" she asked, hoping to appear as neutral as she could.<br><br>But no one said anything for a moment. So Jackson spoke up. "What I think Stuart is trying to say," she started, "is that we should use these sessions to identify any grey areas. After all, the idea of the tribunals is to reach agreement rather than make rulings and invoke punishment. I believe that Brian made some unsavoury comments about Lauryn and then when she tried to leave, he gripped her arm without permission. This would be concerning aggressive behaviour if the other party had clothes on. But as mailgirls we fall into a particular category. And we do have special protections thanks to our unique status here." She stared straight at Stuart as she finished, daring him to respond with something further along his strident line. But he stayed silent this time, apparently seething but carefully aware of the attitudes in the room.<br><br>Belinda continued. "Yes, that was a pretty good summary as I understand it." She looked over to the young engineer. "If you are happy to do so, this is the time when you get say what you want in relation to the issue."<br><br>Brian realised that everyone was looking at him. He cleared his throat. But before he could say anything, Stuart stood up. "You don't have to say anything," he shouted.<br><br>Brian looked silently at Stuart for a moment. Stuart sat down, arms crossed. Brian looked down at the table. "No, I want to speak," he stated firmly. "First I want to apologise to Lauryn. She is obviously not happy with what I did." He looked to the mailgirl. "I'm sorry Lauryn," he told her, "unreservedly." Lauryn nodded her acceptance back at him. He then looked over to Belinda. "To stop this happening in the first place, I don't know, I guess I should have been better prepared for having naked women in the office..."<br><br>"There shouldn't be naked women in the office," Stuart exploded.<br><br>"Yet here we are," Jackson smiled over at him. And to prove that fact, she stood up and stretched to her full height, hands behind her head, pushing out her bust to full advantage. She looked over at Lauryn who shrugged. This would soon be Jackson's fight, not hers. Leave it with her. So Jackson eyeballed Stuart, ready to continue the debate. But Stuart looked away, said nothing. Apparently he realised that he had gone about as far as he could. Probably too far. Anyone else in the room could have asked him why he chose to work at a company with mailgirls with that attitude. And maybe they could test a theory that he actually liked having them around him, at least a deeper level.<br><br>But Belinda intervened before things could re-erupt. "I think we have reached an appropriate point to wind this up," she announced as she closed her laptop and stood up, to underline her intentions. Stuart muttered something that no one could hear. And no one chose to find out what he said.<br><br>Jackson nodded at Lauryn and they both stood up too. Lauryn quickly made her way out of the room to the stairwell, intent on a rapid escape to the relative calm of the mezzanine. Jackson followed right behind her so that Lauryn kept the door open for her before they both set out on their descent from the sixth floor.<br><br>Lauryn stopped on the landing when Jackson placed a hand gently on her shoulder. She turned around and asked her naked friend "what?"<br><br>Jackson smiled. "All that energy in the room," she admitted, "it makes me, well..."<br><br>"Horny?" Lauryn asked with an element of disbelief.<br><br>Jackson took a closer step towards the other mailgirl. "For old times sake," she offered.<br><br>Lauryn smiled. "What's this about old times?" she demanded. "There's nothing old about our times!" And with only a centimetre to move she pressed her lips against those of the other mailgirl. Their kissing continued, Jackson's arms around Lauryn's back. Lauryn reached down to finger Jackson's pussy. "My god," she exclaimed, "you're soaking down there!" Jackson groaned as Lauryn pressed into her. Which only encouraged the other mailgirl to go harder with her fingers in just the right places.<br><br>Jackson pushed herself hard against Lauryn. "You remembered," she gasped as Lauryn pressed her hand firmly where she knew Jackson would want it.<br><br>"Some things you don't forget," Lauryn smiled. She moved her little finger just so on Jackson's clit which brought out a gasp as Jackson spasmed with pleasure.<br><br>Lauryn spent a moment holding Jackson after she came back down. With her senses back Jackson smiled warmly at her friend. "Now it's your turn," she insisted and pushed Lauryn gently down onto her back. Lauryn spread her legs as Jackson knelt there in front of her. Jackson looked up into Lauryn's face for a teasing moment and then moved towards the other mailgirl's open crotch.<br><br>At that moment there was a cough from behind. Jackson turned to look as Lauryn did too. It was Bryce.<br><br>"How long have you been there?" Jackson demanded.<br><br>"Um, just a moment. I wanted to make sure that you were all right," Bryce faltered, quickly realising that he had made a mistake. "Sorry," he added as he backed off towards the door. "I guess I'll just check on you later," he stammered as he exited with as much dignity as he had left.<br><br>The girls were still in position for Jackson to pleasure Lauryn. She looked down at Jackson and she realised. Lauryn knew Jackson too well. She lifted her friend's face so they were looking into each other's eyes. "That is your boyfriend," she announced.<br><br>Jackson gave her a tiny nod. "Uh, maybe," she admitted.<br><br>Lauryn held her stare. "If you don't want to," she offered.<br><br>Jackson gave her friend a wry smile. "You've earned this," she grinned as she leant in to Lauryn's crotch and drew the tip of her tongue over along her slit, to show that she indeed remembered. Lauryn held the back of Jackson's head gently in her hands.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Mick Doohan, the sort of person who always stood out in a crowd, looked put out, sitting uncomfortably in the front row of a packed meeting room. One minute past the hour Lindsay Davenport, the imported American office manager, strode into the room and up to the front, followed by Shane and Stuart as if they three held the power that mattered in the organisation. The two tall athletic mailgirls, Jan Stephenson and Pam Burridge who were there naked at the front of the room shuffled along so that Shane could squeeze next to them. Of course, Shane just had to place a hand on Jan's thigh. But she smiled back at him, Shane was all right.<br><br>In the hushed reaction to the managers' entrance Mick spoke up. "Why did you send an email about this meeting?" he stated loudly, "when you could have sent the mailgirls around with the information?"<br><br>Lindsay gave the Engineering manager her most patronising stare. "We'll try that next time and see how it works." Towards the back of the room Jackson caught Mitch's glance at her from the other side of the room and smirked back at him. Mitch shook his head back at her. Jackson snarled back. Wasn't this the time for some fun? Evidently not.<br><br>Lindsay paused for a moment until her slide presentation came up on the screen behind her. "Thanks for coming everyone," she started with an energy suggesting that she wanted to talk about a lot of things before the meeting could get any respite from her. As the slide title showing behind her warned the staff of Harada Industries, she intoned "firstly I am going to talk about our financial performance."<br><br>Kimiko who was sitting lazily on a table at the back of the room swinging her legs, let out a yawn. As Mick had before, she picked a moment when most of the attendees could hear her in the lull. People turned to look at her. Some laughed. To which Kimiko responded with wide innocent eyes that asked why are you looking at me? Since it was Kimiko many eyes remained fixed on her now that they knew where she was, no doubt hoping for a repeat of her brazen wanking in the previous staff meeting. Or something else equally wild. But, at least for the moment, the mailgirl just sat there, swinging her legs, giving off the air that she did not care that she was naked in this large group and did not care about what other people thought of her. Eyes turned back to the front of the room. Maybe later, they no doubt hoped.<br><br>Lindsay had chosen to wait out the attention on Kimiko and deciding that it was over she continued. "Some of you may think this stuff is boring, sure, I get that. But this is about your jobs and the company's future. You don't have to absorb all the numbers and the financial terms. But please let me explain where we stand as a company, so that you know how secure things are here."<br><br>She paused again, to let that sink in and to let the workers worry for a moment whether what she was about to say would be any threat to their future. Happy that she had everyone's attention, Lindsay continued. "Actually you've all got nothing to worry about. After the cutbacks a year ago the company has been running just fine. You can see from this chart that we are currently quite profitable."<br><br>While the general assembled workers shared a sigh of relief, Jan and Pam stepped forward to do an impromptu jig, facing the rest of the staff since they were at the front. Some of the staff near them, encouraged them by rhythmically hand-clapping to the mailgirls' dance steps which of course encouraged them to continue. Annette Kellerman started down the aisle to join the duo swishing her long blonde hair as she strode down. She whispered to the other two mailgirls. Agreeing with her they stopped swinging their elbows — and their breasts — and instead they linked arms for some chorus line style high kicking which with the mailgirls of course being nude elevated the response from their admirers. More were now clapping along.<br><br>And with further encouragement the three high stepped along the front of the room where they continued with their Can Can routine giving everyone a chance to see them. Nudged by her near companions, Jackson first of all dramatically declined their suggestion then feigned to reluctantly step down to join the trio to the great delight of her colleagues who were more used to her reserved behaviour as she nakedly strode around the office. Her antics on Mitch's desk were little known outside her tight circle. If only they knew.<br><br>But here she was, high kicking, showing off a new side to the assembly and clearly enjoying herself. In fact so much so that she sought Lauryn out, Lauryn who had been trying to conceal herself near a side wall. Jackson stared at her friend and called her name which of course exposed her. Sensing the inevitability, Lauryn walked carefully out to the front and linked her arm with Jackson's. Jackson gave her a quick peck on the cheek and rubbed her back to show her joy that her friend had joined in and soon seemed to be enjoying herself. Everyone was clapping, with only a handful of exceptions. Lindsay, Stuart and Mick were amongst the few who restrained themselves, Stuart wearing a look of disgust while Lindsay and Mick just looked bemused.<br><br>People turned to Kimiko now. She shook her head. But to the delight of those who could see her, she turned the swinging of her legs a bit higher and slower to pastiche what her fellow naked mailgirls were doing down below.<br><br>Shane watched both the chorus line and also Kimiko from his lucky spot right near the chorus line. He wore a huge grin of course. This was what he dreamt of when the mailgirls were introduced, an office behaving something like out of a Fellini movie. Unselfconscious naked women dancing among bemused colleagues while the management failed to exert any control. How would it end? Lindsay tried to look like she was above it all because she felt that was what she had to do. Mick Doohan shook his head. He was yet to be conditioned to working in a circus.<br><br>All the mailgirls attending the staff meeting were in some way engaged in these celebrations except for one. Monika stood at the back looking like she had missed her tram or something. She felt odd that no one was looking at her, no one was suggesting that she should be down the front dancing and showing herself off like the others. What was the issue? She was just as naked as they were.<br><br>Just as suddenly as they had begun, the dancing mailgirls stopped, dropped their arms from each other's shoulders and walked back to where they had been when the meeting started. The supportive rhythmic clapping fell away almost as quickly. Kimiko reverted to swinging her legs lazily, again to her own rhythm.<br><br>Lindsay waited for a couple of beats of silence then continued her speech without acknowledging what they all had just seen. "There is some staffing news. Mr Harada has kindly financed some new mailgirls," she started. At that point Mr Harada appeared on big screen behind the manager of the Melbourne office. He stood in front of his desk in Tokyo and responding to Lindsay's welcome gesture he raised a quavering hand and gave the smallest of waves. He evidently did not see Mick Doohan's look of disgust that Harada Industries would hire more mailgirls but no more engineers. Lindsay chose to ignore Mick there in the front row where she could hardly not notice him.<br><br>"Firstly, let me formally welcome Monika Mayhem to the Harada mailgirl family," Lindsay dramatically announced. She looked around but evidently could not spot the new mailgirl who had started to move towards the front, as she assumed was expected. "Some of you would have seen Monika," Lindsay continued. "She has already been here for a while and has proved to be a capable member of the team." Still Lindsay could not see Monika who now had only a few rows to descent to the front of the room. "If you see her in her travels, please say hello to her and make her feel welcome," Lindsay faltered into platitudes.<br><br>Monika was now close enough to be able to smile at Stuart, who was standing right next to Lindsay. The mailgirl made sure that he could not ignore her. He chose to give her the smallest of nods in response which got a wide grin from the nude mailgirl who squeezed up against his side, pressing herself against his suit and draping one arm around his neck. Stuart looked like he was being strangled by an anaconda, which of course only delighted Monika further. She grabbed one of his hands with her free hand and pressed it hard against her breast. "Not like that," she stage whispered and adjusted her grip to make him squeeze her nipple between two of his fingers. "Better," she whispered again for the amusement of those who could hear her.<br><br>"Since Monika could not be here," Lindsay continued, to the confusion of those who were watching her entanglement with Stuart, "I have the great pleasure to introduce you to our latest mailgirl, who starts today!" She paused for dramatic effect. "June Lockhart." Lindsay exclaimed, seeming to be genuinely pleased with her announcement. She again looked around the room, this time to find the second new addition. "June?" she called.<br><br>The junior worker from HR had been sitting, clothed, with her colleagues from the HR department in the third row. She looked genuinely shocked to be named. "June," Lindsay repeated, and having spotted her, now she was staring straight at the new recruit with a thin smile. A few of June's colleagues looked stunned as June stood up to confirm Lindsay's announcement. Somehow they had evidently missed June's nude afternoon in HR and it seemed no one had told them about it.<br><br>One of them, a woman about June's age stared at her in disbelief. "June?" she gasped, not quite accepting the news. June turned to her with a helpless look on her face. Martin gave the colleague a look saying that what they were seeing was all right.<br><br>June stepped carefully out towards the front of the room. Monika had moved Stuart's free hand down to her crotch where she was trying to get him to properly pleasure her down there. Because that was where some space was, June stood next to Monika unsure what was expected of her. She could see that the assembled colleagues were silently assessing her in her dressed state. But what was meant to happen next?<br><br>"Wendy!" Lindsay commanded. The mailgirls' supervisor was in the front row, likely expecting the summons. She got up from her seat and went up to June to shake her hand in welcome. Wendy looked over at Lindsay whose glance back told her what to do.<br><br>Wendy unbuttoned June's cardigan, slid it off her shoulders. Just as quickly Wendy had June's blouse off and unzipped her skirt to let it fall to the floor. The supervisor took June's hand to help her step out off the skirt. Meanwhile, Monika directed one of Stuart's hands to stroking her clit and had his other hand do something to her from the back, beneath her bottom. Stuart glared at her like he would get even with her, if only he was allowed.<br><br>On the screen Mr Harada grunted and exclaimed something dark in Japanese. June grimaced. "I'm sure he was complimentary," Wendy assured June.<br><br>"I speak Japanese," June hissed back, "he said 'another one from the farm' if you want to know." Strangely June felt safe, still in her bra and pants.<br><br>"I'm sure he meant well," Wendy soothed as she efficiently undid June's bra and slid her pants down her thighs, rendering June completely naked in front of the office. June knew she was now nude, on display. But oddly she did not feel any different to before. Wendy looked around, made a decision and dropped June's clothes into Shane's arms. "You look fabulous," Wendy assured the newly naked woman who was yet to fully absorb her new state. Wendy smiled at June, suggestive that she should smile for the room. Then Wendy placed a friendly hand on June's shoulder. Which suddenly woke her to her predicament. June recoiled from the touch throwing one hand over her breasts, the other over her crotch.<br><br>Realising June's sudden change, Lindsay snapped "You're a mailgirl now!" at her, possibly a little more vehemently than she intended. But it had the desired effect. Wendy lifted one of June's hands away from her breasts, placed it at her side then the other from her crotch. June gave the room a sort of wry smile of surrender. It was enough. The room burst into applause.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Harada's cameraperson pulled the focus back from the boss to show that he had two exquisite local mailgirls with him, who kneeled either side of him, both with black ballgags fitted in their mouths which matched their long straight black hair.<br><br>Wendy noticed the scene in the Tokyo office. "Aren't they gorgeous!" she exclaimed, clearly without thinking on that.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily checked her messages after class. One from her sister Cara just said 'Ring me, something important.' So she did.<br><br>Cara got straight to the point. "Did you know you have a mailgirl researcher on your campus?" she asked her sister.<br><br>Emily was shocked. "What? Really?"<br><br>Cara continued with her revelation. "Apparently they are world renowned. Although I expect that is in a small pool. But she has been published on the subject."<br><br>Emily caught on. "What does she know?"<br><br>"Exactly," Cara responded.<br><br>"So when do we meet her?" Emily got onto Cara's wavelength.<br><br>Emily could sense Cara smirking. "Funny you should ask... She's agreed to meet me, well us, in her room on campus at five. That's if you want to be there." The answer to that was pretty obvious.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Fanny Durack — looking like the stereotypical academic in an understated plaid dress with lots of pockets — sat watching the obviously overexcited two young students who stood facing her behind the seats that she had set out for them. She was deciding whether to give them some reason to tamp down their high enthusiasm or whether to keep them like that for her own amusement. But first she had to be careful.<br><br>"You're obviously interested in mailgirls," she told them, "but why in particular? Tell me what it is about the subject that you want to explore."<br><br>"The empowerment," Cara replied, maybe a little too quickly.<br><br>"Do the mailgirls in the videos look empowered to you?" Fanny challenged.<br><br>"The ones who stride through the offices do," Emily replied, swaying a little from side to side.<br><br>"And the ones who are bound up and being disciplined?" Fanny smiled.<br><br>"Um, a sort of empowerment," Emily tried. Fanny gave her an indulgent look. It was so obvious Emily could reference it. "Uh, what do you mean?" Emily asked back.<br><br>"Have you thought about what it may mean to a woman to spend her day naked delivering messages around an office?" Fanny felt ancient stating it that way and almost immediately regretted it. She also felt a little duplicitous since as well as her studies she was also a mailgirl at Harada Industries. These students did not need to know that.<br><br>She observed both of the twins as they wondered what it might feel like and also what Fanny knew about being a mailgirl. This short, stout academic who seemed to be condescending to them, what could she actually know about being a mailgirl? Cara spoke up. "Have we thought about mailgirls and what it would take to be one? We have actually." She looked assured, defiant.<br><br>Fanny backed down a little. "Sorry, I have to be on guard with new, um, acquaintances. As you can guess, it is a line of study that attracts a certain sort of interest. I can only imagine how what I can tell you might be misinterpreted in the wrong hands."<br><br>"And what makes you think that you can trust us?" Cara was genuinely curious.<br><br>Fanny being Fanny was not taken aback. "You've given me all the right cues so far. Both what you have said and what you have not said. Either you're genuine or very good at pretending to be." She smiled like she was deeply interested in the pair of them. "You can sit," she stated. But then Fanny had another thought as the two of them started around to the front of the chairs. "You can sit," she told Cara. "You," she gestured at Emily, "adopt the mailgirl position."<br><br>Cara sat as invited. Emily raised her top from her waist, clearly preparing to lift it over her head. "What are you doing?" Fanny asked her.<br><br>Emily held her top just below her bust. "Well, if I am going to kneel down like a mailgirl it seems a bit silly to do it in clothes." She looked to Cara who chose to remain neutral.<br><br>"Well if you have to," Fanny dramatically sighed. Which Emily took as her cue to lift her top up over her head, fold and place it on the chair that she had been forbidden to use. She nonchalantly undid her bra, placed it on her folded top. She then continued to strip off totally before adopting the mailgirl pose, kneeling balanced on her toes, legs apart with her shoulders set back to present herself as a mailgirl completely on display. She felt a thrill that her sex was on display to this stranger.<br><br>Fanny silently watched Emily's strip. She looked impressed at how Emily effortlessly rested on her knees and toes. "Either you're a natural or you've practised a lot," Fanny noted.<br><br>"Bit of both," Emily grinned. "So," she continued, "are you really world renowned?"<br><br>"It's a niche," Fanny conceded.<br><br>"So no conferences yet?" Cara asked.<br><br>Fanny grinned. "Now, that would be interesting." She looked to Cara. "No interest in getting into the role too?"<br><br>Cara smiled over at her sister. "No, that's her thing. I wouldn't want to compete." Emily gave her sister a look of disbelief.<br><br>"So in that case, I'll just direct my questions at you Emily. How would you feel if you had to work in an office in that state all day, every day?"<br><br>Emily gave her sister a serious look then grinned widely at Fanny. "It would be wild," she gushed.<br><br>Cara shook her head. "I can't see you getting much work done, Em," she noted.<br><br>Fanny tried to look serious. "There are rules of course. Targets and rewards or punishments depending on your performance. What you can and can't do is quite structured. There is a level of submission expected. Although that doesn't seem to be a problem for you." Fanny raised an eye at Emily who chose to look down at the floor. She wants submissive, she thought.<br><br>"So what do you most enjoy researching?" Cara asked Fanny, deciding to deflect the conversation so that they could learn something too. "Have you met mailgirls?"<br><br>Fanny chose to give her dry academic answer. "My area of interest is the effect that mailgirls have on the offices that they are introduced into. Does it affect productivity, which of the employees approve, which ones disapprove and whether their attitudes change over time. I am interested in the general ambience of an office which has mailgirls. Is it better, healthier, friendlier, does it make people think of sex and nudity in a more healthy way..."<br><br>Cara butted in. "You mentioned sex? Nudity I understand. But the sex?"<br><br>Fanny grinned. "Well, researching mailgirls is pretty intimate already. So those who have participated in my studies are already open to, let's say an intimate examination. Of their attitudes and reactions. Getting them to discuss their attitudes to sex is not that hard."<br><br>Cara tried to speak as casually as possible. "So have you studied the mailgirls office here in Melbourne? It must be convenient. You could have done that stuff that you want to, monitor the introduction of mailgirls into a place that did not have them?" Cara did not miss that Fanny was blushing despite her best efforts to appear to be the distanced academic. What did that mean, Cara wondered. But she knew better than to probe that. If she was lucky it would just come out organically.<br><br>Fanny felt composed again. "Naturally that would be a wonderful opportunity." She paused for a moment. "Neither of you work there?" she asked wondering whether she was fooling them at all. You could never be sure how perceptive Uni students were. But you could generally assume that they were quite perceptive.<br><br>Cara looked over at Emily who spoke up. "We saw that current affairs special," Emily stated. "It got us interested."<br><br>"It was pretty tough on the mailgirls," Cara added, almost blurting 'you mailgirls' which had her wondering that about Fanny. "You knew the attitude of the report before you saw it. But you're the expert," Cara corrected her course, "what did you make of it?"<br><br>Fanny folded her arms and shrugged. "The media in its prurient way is going to dramatise certain aspects partly pretending its on a moral crusade and partly to draw people in who hope to see some naked women. Given the restrictions of mass media, people are going to be disappointed in both aspects. You're not going to get full frontal on the TV. Plus they laid off a bit on the moral crusade to keep in good with Harada. And then there's the general attitude to nudity. If someone walked in here now and saw Emily, there could be an interesting situation."<br><br>"Would it affect your job?" Cara asked.<br><br>Fanny shook her head. "Due to the nature of my research, I am given a certain leeway here. There's no secret in the department about what I do."<br><br>That got Cara wondering. How did it take them so long to find out about Fanny and her research?<br><br>Fanny tapped something on her phone and then looked to Emily. "Are you getting uncomfortable like that?"<br><br>"Not yet," Emily replied seemingly truthfully.<br><br>At that moment, a man walked into the office. "You called?" he asked Fanny as he approached her desk.<br><br>"Have you had a chance to process that latest mailgirl data, Charles? These women are interested," Fanny informed him.<br><br>Charles looked at Emily as if there was nothing untoward about him standing next to a kneeling naked mailgirl. "I imagine that I should have guessed at their interest," he stated blandly as he reached out to shake the mailgirl's hand. Emily nodded back at Charles as he let go of her, clearly aslo at ease with the circumstances of being on display to this stranger. Looking back to Fanny, he asked "is there anything that I should be recording?" Fanny was looking closely at Emily intent on her reactions. Cara did not need to look since she knew her sister would be acting like her situation was the most natural thing in the world.<br><br>Fanny smiled at Charles. "I don't think a recording would be of any use." Then she made a big deal of remembering her manners. "Oh I should introduce you. This is Charles Bradley my research assistant. And this is Emily Johnson and her sister Cara. Emily is studying psychology here, so who knows, we may see more of her around the place."<br><br>"Hard to imagine we could see more of her," Charles joked.<br><br>"Now, now Charles, none of that undergrad humour here," Fanny smiled.<br><br>"Okay, I'll let you to have all of the fun," he conceded with a grin and left.<br><br>"Now how are we going to finish this?" Fanny asked Emily with Charles out of the room and the door closed. "Do you need to get yourself off?"<br><br>"I think I can wait until I get home," Emily responded.<br><br>Fanny was back to being distant. "Oh, that's good," she agreed. "Now, do either of you have any further questions for me?"<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson pinched herself. She faced her Australian mailgirl colleague Heather McKay who was now a mailgirl in the States on a Zoom call. But it was Heather's equally nude companion on the call, Jeneva who was the cause of the pinching. Jackson had linked up her laptop to one of the wall screens in a meeting room so it was pretty much like they were sitting across a table as they talked.<br><br>Although Jeneva was an imposing woman, a real head turner whether she was in clothes or not, tall with strikingly wavy long dark hair and a fit body, she was asking Jackson in a little girl voice about the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. She so wanted to see Australia.<br><br>"That's in Sydney," Jackson gently corrected her. "We're in Melbourne." Jackson tried to catch Heather's eye via the VC, wondering why she had not already cleared that up.<br><br>But they could not stop Jeneva that easily. "So what do you have in Melbourne?" she asked confidently. "Beaches? Kangaroos?" She shook her shoulders like she was getting ready to run down the sand and into the sparkling blue water. Her breasts shimmied in her excitement.<br><br>"We have some beaches, yes," Jackson tried. At that moment Monika and June joined Jackson in the room.<br><br>Heather seeing new faces and new bodies chortled excitedly from her side. "New mailgirls!" she exclaimed as she stood up like she just had to prove that she was as naked as they were, "welcome to the club!" Monika introduced herself. "Welcome to the company," Heather enthused.<br><br>Jackson quietly noted a look of disapproval on Jeneva's face, one that the American mailgirl quickly hid. Nothing suggested that any of the others had noticed.<br><br>June introduced herself softly. "Still getting used to it," she managed.<br><br>"I know you," Heather insisted, her usual raucous self.<br><br>"I don't know," June mumbled, "I've only been working here a short while."<br><br>"Sure I do," Heather insisted. Then seeing no recognition from June, she dropped it. "We were just discussing Melbourne beaches when you came in," she explained.<br><br>"I didn't know we had any," Monika stated flatly. Jeneva looked worried. Australia had to be like she imagined it, she so wanted to be there.<br><br>"Don't be like that," Heather urged Monika, "there's lots of good things to do in Melbourne." She stroked Jeneva's arm. "Don't worry," she told the taller American, "you'll love it." The stroking continued. Chrissy, Heather's girlfriend had come into their room. She slinked up behind Heather and gave her a big kiss on the cheek, not fussed that her girlfriend kept stroking the other American mailgirl in the room. "She's my girlfriend," Heather explained to the Australians as she gave Chrissy a big hug and then kissed her back on the lips as she swept her girlfriend's long blonde hair away from her face.<br><br>"You mean..." June started.<br><br>Heather laughed her raucous laugh. "You don't think it's against the natural order of things?" June looked pained. "People like us loving each other?" June stared, now mortified at what she had implied. "An Australian and an American?" Heather chortled. "Do you think it could work?"<br><br>June blushed red. "I didn't..." she started.<br><br>But Heather butted in again. "I like boys too," she smiled. "Well occasionally. Like our Shane. Well, I certainly like him." She licked her lips at that thought which Chrissy found hilarious. "How's he getting on?" Heather asked the Australians.<br><br>Monika and June both looked momentarily shocked at Heather's revelation about Shane. Jackson was of course not touched. "He's the same old Shane," Jackson told Heather.<br><br>"And Mitch?" Heather asked.<br><br>Jackson hesitated to answer that, trying to quickly recall how much Heather knew about her and Mitch. Monika piped up though. "I think there are depths to that one," she declared. And she squeezed a nipple between two fingers as if that was a clue.<br><br>Both Heather and Jackson were surprised at what Monika was hinting. "Do tell," Heather demanded. Jackson wondered that she had not found her voice on that topic. Hidden what?<br><br>"He's up to something," Monika revealed. "If I know men, and believe me I do, he's up to something. He's keeping something or someone a secret."<br><br>"It's not you Jackson?" Heather checked. Of course she knew about that.<br><br>"Definitely not me!" Jackson insisted, more vehemently than she intended. She would not admit that, for a little while now, there had been nothing between her and Mitch. He kept his clothes on and she stayed on her side of the desk. Jackson stewed privately on that for a moment before realising that the others were back to discussing Melbourne beaches.<br><br>Monika got a buzz to check her app. "Gotta go," she sang out. "Looks like your Shane wants me," she told Heather as she mussed her hair like she had to look her best for this man.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Monika sauntered into Stuart's office. He looked up at her from behind his desk. He was unimpressed. "Did I call you? I don't think so," he stated. He tried not to look at her.<br><br>Monika smiled, ignoring his scowl as she stepped up close to his desk. She set her shoulders back, nicely wobbling her breasts as she answered him. "No you didn't. Shane sent me up with a message. Something about a cricket match he wants you to watch with him."<br><br>Stuart tried to maintain his focus on Monika's face. He did not want her to think he was ogling her body, did not want to give her any encouragement. "Did I agree to that? I don't think so."<br><br>Monika smiled sweetly. "He thought you would say that. But he's already bought tickets for you and your family. And for his too. He's not taking no for an answer. 'It will be good to expose you to some local culture.' At least that's what he said." She leant over the desk smiling at Stuart, her breasts swaying enticingly. As she liked to do with him.<br><br>Stuart tried to be agreeable, tried to ignore the naked woman's display. "And what do you think of this, er, cricket match?"<br><br>"I have no opinion. Melbournites are supposed to be mad about sports. But I'll let you into a secret. I never got it. Not my thing. But Shane, he loves his cricket." Monika's look told Stuart there was no way out.<br><br>"So I'll have to go?" Stuart surprised himself by looking to his tormentor to help him with this situation.<br><br>Monika smiled but closed the door on that. "No way out. Wake in fright."<br><br>Stuart looked concerned. "What does that mean?"<br><br>Monika was offhand. "Oh, just a saying. It doesn't mean anything. Like 'have a nice day' I guess."<br><br>"Except it seems to be saying the opposite," Stuart pointed out.<br><br>"We do that. When you've been here for a while you'll get it." Monika smiled like she could be Stuart's trusty guide through the labyrinth of Australian customs and meanings.<br><br>Stuart coughed. It was a change of subject. "I did not appreciate your performance at the staff meeting," he chided.<br><br>Monika leaned right up close to Stuart's face. "Performance?" she challenged. "I was just doing what mailgirls are paid to do."<br><br>That was too much for Stuart. "Oh come on!" he exploded. Which only encouraged Monika to stand up and slowly slide around Stuart's desk, running a provocative finger along the top as she sidled towards Stuart until she was behind the desk, standing over him. Still she maintained her friendly, light persona.<br><br>"It's all in the rules," Monika flirted. "I'm sure that you know all the rules. They teach you them, right? When you start in this office?" Monika was not to know Stuart had refused to attend that course. But she continued. "You know, the rules where the fabrics have to follow our instructions to pleasure us. Unless you've got a very good excuse." Monika traced one hand across her large bust.<br><br>"I'm married. That's a very good excuse!" Stuart blurted.<br><br>Monika shook her head. "That one's not on the list. I asked about that one because, well, I wanted to make sure. Well, as you know fabrics are not permitted to get any obvious pleasure from the mailgirls unless we specifically let you. So it's been decided that since you get no pleasure from what you are doing, then it is not a sexual act for you, so it's not cheating or any sort of sin so we're safe, you and me." Monika was stroking her clit, humping her finger a little bit. "I'd like you to finish this off," she grunted, moving so close to Stuart that having to extend himself to help was not an issue. She was there, ready for him. "Now," she oozed, "who's going to help a girl out?"<br><br>Stuart sighed as Monika took his hand and placed it between her legs.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Four of the mailgirls sat together on the mezzanine. Having again arranged the display chairs in a square facing each other, they were on display to the floors above but primarily to each other. Jan and Pam faced each other with their pussies spread as Annette and Monika also displayed to each other, their hands loose over the armrests. They were just chatting, naked sure, but nothing more.<br><br>"Do you have a thing going on with Stuart?" Annette asked Monika who tried to deny it.<br><br>Pam piped up. "Come on, you've just been telling us about your latest tryst with Stuart. And we all saw you in the staff meeting."<br><br>"But he wouldn't help," Monika complained. "I had to get myself off."<br><br>"While you enjoyed every minute of it," Jan laughed.<br><br>"I really don't know how I'm going to survive with all these opportunities," Monika worried.<br><br>"You've got to learn to pace yourself," Annette weighed in. "That's why none of us are wanking at the moment." Monika had wondered about that. With her pussy spread for the rest to see and with her orgasm on Stuart's desk, fully on show to the uptight American boss, still fresh in her mind and her body, she would have been touching herself there in front of the other mailgirls. Except that none of them seemed interested in doing it themselves. That had held her back. So, the secret was pacing.<br><br>Annette had not finished. "Did you enjoy the staff meeting?" she called over to Wendy who was, as usual, at her desk attending to her work.<br><br>Wendy looked up, not that upset to have been disturbed from her spreadsheet. "I wasn't listening," the mailgirls' supervisor told them, "what are you on about now?"<br><br>Jan picked it up. "What did you think of us in the staff meeting? Do we get extra credits for being that enthusiastic about our work?"<br><br>"Well," Wendy smiled, "I didn't know that you could dance. So I guess that's something."<br><br>"I'd hardly call it dancing," Annette pointed out. "All we did was stand in line and kick our legs in the air. I'll show you dancing." She stood up and stared over at Jan. "I'm going to need a volunteer from the audience." Jan smiled at the cliché, shrugged and stood up too. Annette led her to the open area of the floor. Jan stood facing her, wondering what they'd do. Annette clapped her hands rhythmically counting one Two Three FOUR as she went. "It's a tango," she told Pam and Monika, clearly requiring them to keep time.<br><br>They tried it for a moment before Wendy looked back up from her computer. "I think I've got it," the supervisor told the mailgirls. From her computer came music, identifiably a tango tune. Now three of the watchers were clapping along as Annette took Jan in her arms breast to breast and pranced forward to the music, while Jan matched her steps. Annette gripped Jan around her waist which drew them together and allow Annette to easily lead her. A brief shimmy and they were dancing breast to breast, crotch to crotch. And cheek to cheek. The music pounded and all three watching clapped passionately, swept up in the thrill of the moment.<br><br>They did not bother to notice that quite a crowd was now watching the performance from the higher floors.<br><br>Jackson and June walked into the carry-on and initially shook their heads in amazement as they watched. "Can you dance?" June asked the other mailgirl. June was already swaying in anticipation.<br><br>"Hell no," Jackson fired back.<br><br>June gave the other mailgirls a knowing look. She walked over and looked closely at Pam. Her walk was a measured tease, step by deliberate step. She was already starting to move with the rhythm. "How about you? I can tell that you can," she told the taller mailgirl who smiled up at June as she stood there tapping one foot, ready to get started. Pam stood up and quickly found herself in the arms of their newest colleague in nudity who, it quickly emerged, knew her stuff on the dance floor and was readily able to lead.<br><br>It may have looked comical, the shorter woman leading Pam who was a head taller than her around the room in the forbidden dance, it may have seemed ridiculous except that June was a very good dancer. And Pam was an accommodating partner.<br><br>"Do you dance Wendy?" Annette called out as she led Jan close to the supervisor's desk.<br><br>Wendy shook her head. "I can only dream," she laughed.<br><br>Because of their height difference, June and Pam could not dance crotch to crotch like Annette and Jan who shamelessly ground their pussies together. June's approach was rather to move Pam around to show her off to their audience, Pam doing high, wide leg kicks then bending her knees wide as she swooped low to confront June face to face.<br><br>Pam suddenly let go of Annette. "Enough!" she cried out. "Even my mailgirl conditioning can't make me last too long doing that," she tittered. She was sweating.<br><br>Annette grinned back at her panting partner. "Tango," she laughed, "where the woman does all the work."<br><br>The watching mailgirls enthusiastically applauded the dancers getting little bows in response. The viewers were clapping but they were muted by distance and glass.<br><br>Annette called over to Wendy as the dancers returned to their seats. "Have you heard anything about Rosemary's next TV segment?" she asked. Wendy shook her head. So Annette looked over to Jackson. "You think about these things," she told Jackson, "what do you think Rosemary's next TV segment will look like?"<br><br>The other mailgirls looked over to Jackson, and even Wendy stopped what she was doing to see what the unofficial leader of the mailgirls thought about the journalist's visit. "I don't think any of it will be usable," Jackson informed the group. "I can't see how any of the footage of Rosemary can make it onto the TV. Anything that can be used will either be innocuous or so heavily censored you would have to wonder why she put herself through this..." she gestured at their nudity, "for a few moments of what? They have no new angle other than 'mailgirl for a day' and I gather that no one said anything in the interviews that expands on what they put out the first time."<br><br>June thought about that for a moment. "She's not stupid," the newest mailgirl observed, "she must have known that would be the case. Like you say, Jackson, why would she do it? She must have something in mind."<br><br>"Maybe she wants to come back and become a mailgirl," Monika suggested. The other mailgirls looked disbelief at her. "She liked what she saw and decided it was something that she wanted to do." Monika looked around. "Yeah, I know what you're thinking. High profile job, well paid, respected in her profession, why would she want to do something like this? Well, I'll tell you. Everyone of us has different motivations. We're all here, I'll wager, for different reasons. And I'm not going to try to guess how Rosemary's mind works."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Kimiko strode into Mitch's office. She quickly confirmed that she had his full attention. Mitch beamed at the sight of her slinking towards him. She was not surprised. He had admitted that he had very little work to do and would always appreciate the distraction of a visit, especially from his lover. "Mitch," she smiled as she catwalked towards his desk, "I'd like to thank you for everything."<br><br>Mitch straightened up. "That's not necessary." Although intense about their affair, he was still unsure of her, careful that she may change her mood or her attitude to him at any moment. Kimiko's carefully choreographed and costumed lovemaking, that could be merely performance, not a sign of anything deeper. She stretched out across Mitch's desk, studying his face, stretching her arms as far as she could.<br><br>Kimiko smiled, daring Mitch as she leant back on the desk now spreading her arms wide and raising one leg to completely expose herself to him. "I didn't say it was necessary," she teased. "Come on, big man, onto the couch." Clearly she had her needs too.<br><br>Mitch stood up and let the naked mailgirl lead him over to the couch which he had never expected to use for such purposes. As Mitch sat, Kimiko knelt at his feet and carefully unbuttoned his trousers. She looked impressed with the hardness of his erection. She engulfed him in her mouth swirling her tongue around the way she knew he liked it. She smiled up into his eyes as she balanced on her knees with her mouth full, eagerly bobbing up and down on his cock. She not only knew how to please the ex-boss. She also knew how to stop him from cumming until she was ready. The exquisite agony of his pleasure. She could see it in his face, his eyes shut tight one moment, then engrossed in her the next. His lust also turned her on.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The mailgirls on the mezzanine had no way of knowing that while they were wondering about Rosemary, she was locked into an editing room with Trisha Noble, her camera operator from her second visit to Harada. Neither would Kimiko or Mitch have given the reporter a second thought.<br><br>"I don't think we can use any of it," Rosemary complained, unknowingly echoing Jackson's viewpoint on the mezzanine. Rosemary stared hard at Trisha. "There's almost no footage of me from the side. It's all either full frontal or else you have my superb arse on display."<br><br>Was Rosemary accusing her? Trisha chose to reply as drily as she could. "If you say so," she responded unenthusiastically. "But if you recall, you spent the day either rushing ahead of me or setting up the shot for me to catch you walking into rooms, etc."<br><br>"You should have thought of that."<br><br>Trisha smiled caustically. "We can always go back."<br><br>"Oh, you'd like that. More nude footage of me for your collection."<br><br>"Yair," Trisha drawled, "my collection." As if she could think of anything worse. Like what could she do with it? For a start if any of it leaked, she would be number one suspect and good-bye to her career. Whichever way Trisha thought about it, Rosemary had her caught. She brought their talk back to the problem at hand. "Meanwhile we have a current affairs segment to salvage." Management, they both knew, had expectations. They wanted something to broadcast.<br><br>Rosemary eased up a little. "So what have we got?"<br><br>"Well, that stuff of you entering the building is good and usable. So long as we have something strong or salacious that delivers on its promise of something big happening inside."<br><br>Rosemary tapped her fingers on the console, thinking of an angle. She stopped the rapping and looked to Trisha. "What if they forced me to do it?"<br><br>"What?" Trisha spat out, taken by surprise.<br><br>Rosemary remained calm. She was calculating. "Say I put a v/o after the entrance footage saying that they forced me to be a mailgirl once I was there, trapped?"<br><br>Trisha shook her head. "One, that would be a criminal offence that you are accusing them of. Two, I've seen the emails between you and Harada arranging the visit. So it's instantly refutable. And three, your whole shtick is the tough woman who goes where no one else dares. You'd be playing the victim here and, bang, there you go, lost your standing and your authority on the screen like that." She clicked her fingers for emphasis.<br><br>Rosemary backtracked. "So strong investigative women goes into weird company and does what they do there to be able to report on what it is really like."<br><br>Trisha produced a condescending smile that the reporter chose to read as enthusiastic assent. So Trisha pretended to be pumped by the idea and put it into her own words. "Yes, that could work. That's the Rosemary Millwall that everyone wants to see on their televisions." She nodded eagerly at the reporter to emphasise her enthusiasm. While thinking 'what they want to see is the bigshot Rosemary Millward on their screens naked and being brought down a peg or two, most likely.' Trisha stared for a moment at the locked door that meant she was trapped in the editing booth with this.<br><br>Rosemary was not trapped. "I see a Walkley," she beamed, referring to Australia's premier journalism awards. Trisha could not tell if she was genuine or deluded. Walkley, she thought, more like a Wankley. And she had footage of that too from their visit. Which also would never be seen by anyone other than her and Rosemary. Feeling emboldened, Trisha forced Rosemary to get out of her chair so that she could work the console.<br><br>Opening a file she smiled up at Rosemary looming over her. "Time to explore your inner mailgirl," Trisha told the journalist.<br><br>Rosemary looked confused for a moment then got the reference. "You didn't, did you?" she spluttered. But it was obvious from the image on the screen that indeed Trisha had indeed filmed Rosemary's seduction by Fanny while she was spread open in one of the display chairs on the mezzanine. Trisha had recorded it from far enough away that when Fanny told the journalist that it was time to explore her inner mailgirl, two of the other mailgirls were also in shot, casually watching Rosemary's seduction. Trisha had zoomed in on Rosemary's face as Fanny assailed her pussy which brought on, what Rosemary now remembered with help from the image on the screen, was the first of a serious of loud, powerful orgasms.<br><br>Rosemary turned to Trisha in the editing room as her groans grew louder in the footage on the screen. She tried to contained her reactions as she watched herself pumping and heaving. "Is this turning you on?" she snarled at Trisha. But Rosemary's face was flushed. So clearly she was.<br><br>Trisha knew she had the control. "I tend to keep my sex life out of the office," she bragged.<br><br>Rosemary turned to her assistant, regaining her calm she shook her head. "That's not what the rumour mill says."<br><br>Now Trisha was surprised. "Oh really?" she retorted.<br><br>Rosemary crossed her arms. The playback ended, so she had silence to make her reveal. "Something about you and a well-hung floor manager. A certain Vic Trumper?" she suggested.<br><br>"And how do you know he is well-hung?" was the best that Trisha could respond.<br><br>Rosemary nudged Trisha out of the control seat and flicked through some folders on the drive. "This one," she chortled. "Journalism, it's about investigation and story telling," she added.<br><br>Trisha now looked worried. "And this story is told to who?" she wondered.<br><br>Rosemary was in control. "Well, let's see, shall we?" She double-clicked the file she wanted and pointed to the first image on the screen, a fit shirtless man. "That's your Victor Trumper, right?" Rosemary asked. Trisha did not deny it.<br><br>On the screen, Victor Trumper flexed his biceps at a companion who was out of shot. "Are you sure you want to tape this?" he asked them.<br><br>The camera pulled back. Trisha sat on a couch in her bra and panties. She looked into the camera. "I want a record of this for those quiet nights at home," she replied. "A souvenir."<br><br>Vic still checked. "Are you afraid it will get out?"<br><br>Trisha shook her head. "Not really. Unless you are?" And she unhooked her bra.<br><br>Rosemary paused the playback and looked hard at her companion. "Comments?" she asked sharply.<br><br>Trisha crossed her arms. "I may have been taken out of context," she tried.<br><br>"Let's check," Rosemary enthusiastically responded. She resumed the playback. On the screen Trisha looked straight at the camera. As she slid her panties down her legs, she licked her lips at the eagerly smiling Victor. Then she turned back to the camera. Her face filled the screen. "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me," she repeated.<br><br>"Which context would that be?" Rosemary uttered as drily as possible. Trisha stayed silent as she watched herself on her back on the couch, spreading her legs. Victor needed no instructions or further invitation. He eased himself onto and then into Trisha. They fucked for a few moments in the conventional missionary position, Trisha with her arms tight around Vic's back. Victor looked into the camera then stopped the fucking. Trisha looked at him, what was the problem. He tilted Trisha's body up towards him then raised one of her legs. He clearly knew what he was doing. Because now the viewer could clearly see Victor entering Trisha, see each stroke as he drove his cock only halfway into Trisha. But that was enough to give her the sensations that she craved. And it was all in shot, her face, his cock, her pussy. Victor certainly enjoyed performing for the camera. He sped up, his half thrusts into her over-stimulating the sensitive head of his cock. He was not going to last long. And Trisha thrusting back at the floor manager was enjoying her own peak.<br><br>Rosemary smiled dangerously at Trisha. "Now here's my favourite bit," she warned. Victor pulled out as he was about to cum and aimed his cock at Trisha's face. She licked her lips. Vic got most of it on her cheeks and on her forehead where it dripped down her face. Her face covered in cum, Trisha looked straight into the camera. "That's all for tonight," she smiled. "Keep safe and tune back in tomorrow." Then she licked at a string of cum that had dribbled off her nose.<br><br>"You recognise that line?" Rosemary asked Trisha as the camera lingered on Trisha's grinning face.<br><br>"Um, it's your sign off," Trisha replied uncomfortably.<br><br>Rosemary crossed her arms. "Quite."<br><br>They had an awkward silence in the booth for a moment. "Uh, what do you intend to do?" Trisha asked, now quite worried.<br><br>Rosemary relaxed back in her seat. She let the silence play on Trisha's anxiety for a moment. "Actually I plan to do nothing," she announced. "Don't worry." Then Rosemary adopted a strange look. "Shall we watch it again?" Rosemary asked. Then she loosened her slacks. "I plan to enjoy it properly this time as I think that is its intent," she explained. "It's quite hot." Rosemary restarted the clip then put her hand down her pants. She smiled condescendingly at Trisha. "Whatever you choose to do is up to you," she added. "Then we can solve the other problem."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson had a lot of things on her mind. She was thinking about June, the new mailgirl, thinking about her and Lauryn, about Lauryn leaving, about Stuart's behaviour at the tribunal, thinking about Rosemary and her next telecast, thinking about the labour law and the signed agreement outlining their roles and management's responsibilities, and she was thinking about Lindsay's idea to have guest mailgirls coming into the office. Her head was a whirr, she needed to talk it out. Have a talk with Mitch, if he was in his office. If not, well she would have to stew until she got some time with him. She heard some drilling in the wall which distantly distracted her. And then it all came piling back into her thoughts.<br><br>Jackson automatically strode up the stairs on her way to the tenth floor. She had too much on her mind to notice how little climbing the stairs taxed her these days. Ahead of her, the door on the ninth floor opened. She barely considered who had entered the stairwell, her private domain. They turned to acknowledge her.<br><br>"Jackson," a familiar male voice addressed her.<br><br>"Um, not now Bryce," she shot back as she recognised this man who was what, her, maybe, possible lover. He took the hint and kept climbing ahead of her. Bryce went past the tenth, clearly on his way back to his desk on the eleventh. Jackson took a deep breath for confidence then opened the door to the tenth to go and see her mentor. Which issue to mention first? Which one worried her the most? The guest mailgirls?<br><br>Jackson strode past the IT workers. One, maybe two, looked up but as it was clear that she was heading towards the office at the back of the floor and was not there to see them, they went back to their work. Maybe they looked at her for a moment because she was naked and toned. The IT workers liked to look, that was understood. Jackson barely registered them as she went past to reach Mitch's office. Since it was Mitch, she opened the door and stepped in.<br><br>"Mitch, if you have a minute..." Jackson started.<br><br>Mitch looked up at Jackson from the couch. Kimiko too turned, looked up at Jackson from the couch. Jackson froze. She looked but she did not see. She stood exposed and rigid, needing a moment to focus. Kimiko was naked. Of course she was. She was a mailgirl. Mitch was naked. Well, waist down. That was wrong. His shirt was unbuttoned. Unbuttoned?<br><br>Kimiko sat on Mitch. His hands were on her. She was on him. That was... wrong?<br><br>"Mitch," Jackson uttered weakly. Mitch looked at Jackson but said nothing. Kimiko turned back to face Mitch. Jackson realised. She had to focus, had to confirm. She could see. He was inside Kimiko. His shirt was unbuttoned.<br><br>Jackson stumbled out, back through the IT section, back to the door past the lifts, and up the stairs barely looking where she was going. But she knew where she had to go. She only had to navigate one flight of stairs from Mitch's office on the tenth floor to her destination. She pushed the door onto the eleventh floor and did not register at first that the one person waiting for a lift to come was Stuart Broad.<br><br>He looked over as the mailgirl stepped uncertainly towards him. "Jackson," he announced, "Good that you're here. I needed to discuss..."<br><br>Jackson let him go no further. "Not now Stuart," she hissed as she straightened up and pushed past him. Fortunately his lift arrived so there was no further awkwardness. Jackson continued on into the engineers' section.<br><br>Everyone there looked up at the thin nude who wavered near the entrance to their section. Bryce looked up and sensed it was his moment. He quickly stood up and strode over to Jackson. "What's up?" he asked her, concerned.<br><br>"Stairwell now Bryce," she shot back. He carefully followed the object of his desire as she retraced path through the now empty landing. Bryce opened the door to the stairwell. Jackson went up a step, sat down and spread her legs so that Bryce could work his magic. He ate her out, working her clit and the sensitive area around it as he knew she liked him to. Jackson thrust at him and leaned her head back with a whimper. And then a shudder.<br><br>Bryce stopped and leaned back to better see Jackson as she convulsed from her shoulders. "Are you crying?" he ventured.<br><br>Jackson grabbed his head in both her hands. "I am not crying!" she insisted vehemently. And pressed his face back into her crotch. And hoped that he could make her forget. One thing she realised that he was very good at.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily scrolled through her phone after her lecture ended. It rang, unknown number. She thought for a moment then decided What the Hell and answered it. She wandered out of the faculty building, saw some privacy on the grass under a tree. She marched over there as the party on the other end introduced themselves to her.<br><br>It's Shane here.<br><br>Who? I don't know a Shane. I do know an...<br><br>It's Uncle Shane here.<br><br>Uncle Shane! How are you? Do you want to see me again?<br><br>Sure, one day. Soon. Meanwhile I found out something for you that might be what you're looking for.<br><br>Emily wondered for a moment what that could be. She was still thinking about analysis of variance.<br><br>Emily, are you still there?<br><br>Sure am, Uncle Shane. What am I looking for?<br><br>A chance to be a mailgirl. I think you might have mentioned it. They both laughed. Shane continued. Another company is thinking of starting it up. In Melbourne. Not far from here. But far enough away.<br><br>Thanks, Uncle Shane, yes! Can you get me in there?<br><br>Are you sure about doing this, Emily?<br><br>Don't worry, it will be our little secret.<br><br>I don't think so, Emily. If you do it, it will be a whole office of people. I don't think there is anything secret about it.<br><br>Yeah, okay Uncle Shane. Nothing secret. So what's the deal?<br><br>Famechon Engineering is doing a mailgirls pilot program. We're sending over a few of ours. But they are going to recruit their own.<br><br>So you can recommend me as an intern.<br><br>And you just happen to be there when...<br><br>Thanks, Uncle Shane, I can see it all clearly now. Of course I want to. Just tell me when and I'll be there. Thanks!<br><br>Emily looked around at the students in groups, in their ones and twos, moving with purpose on the campus. She felt now like she was one of them, a student with a purpose. She got up and strode out into the unexpected sunshine, thinking 'mailgirl.' It was really going to happen. As she walked, she scrolled through her videos and found the one. She played Mailgirls in Australia, one of her favourites, although she suspected it was not actually set in Australia. The office just did not look right.<br><br>But the mailgirls striding through the office were gorgeous and Emily could now see herself doing that. Why not? She had done it on stage in front of an enraptured paying audience. And in the University cafe. And with her sister...<br><br>So engrossed that she was shocked by a voice, someone standing beside her. "Doing research for the sequel?" the woman asked her. Regaining her composure, Emily looked up from the video at Sarah, one of the actors from her production of Mailgirls In The Office. "Shall we find somewhere to sit?" Sarah asked. "Somewhere we can share your research?"<br><br>Emily nodded, turned and led Sarah back to the tree where they could talk in semi-private. Sarah sat with her and looked closely at the screen. "I don't think I know this one? Is it new?"<br><br>Emily appeared aghast. "It's the one supposedly set in Australia. Although I don't think it is. You must have seen it?"<br><br>Sarah watched the video for a moment. "All the voices are American."<br><br>Emily looked closer. "Yair, that could be it." Of course.<br><br>Sarah's eyes widened as the scene changed, now the supermodel mailgirls who were on their knees eating out of dog bowls. "Mailgirls do that?" she wondered.<br><br>"Who knows?" Emily responded brightly. But then she got serious. "But I may be about to find out. My next role — sorry to say for our Uni production — looks like it is going to be playing the real thing."<br><br>"I don't get it," Sarah admitted.<br><br>"I've just been invited to be a mailgirl. In an actual office. Here. In Melbourne."<br><br>Sarah's eyes widened. "I don't believe it! That's fantastic. This calls for a celebration." She leaned over and kissed Emily on the mouth.<br><br>Emily pulled back and gave Sarah a wicked look. "Sarah, you'll ruin my reputation," she mocked.<br><br>Sarah chose to take that head on. "I don't think you have a shred of reputation left on campus."<br><br>"That was art," Emily complained.<br><br>Sarah crossed her arms. "In that case we better take this off campus. My place is not far away. I think it is high time to give you a mailgirl refresher." She delivered her suggestion with serious schoolmarm vibes.<br><br>Emily treated Sarah's suggestion with equal seriousness. "You're right, I probably do need the practice." Well, she thought, add it to the regular practice her sister already gave her. But Sarah did not have to know that.<br><br>Sarah looked Emily up and down, clearly happy she could assist. "You'll make a great mailgirl. If I haven't told you, you're a babe without your clothes."<br><br>Emily smiled slyly. "Thanks. So are you." Well, she was.<br><br>They glowingly looked into each other's eyes. They both sensed the heat welling up in each other. Emily because she was on the verge of realising her dream. Sarah because, to her joy, she was part of Emily's latest wild adventure. As they got up off the grass the two of them burst into loud giggles. Sarah grabbed Emily's hand and led the way to her place.<br><br>`

                    title: "Pt. 16",
                    subtitle: "A surprise or two on mailgirl Lauryn’s last day.", 
                    content: `The mailgirls had assembled in the boardroom. Just the mailgirls. When Fanny Durack arrived, eight of the nine naked workers in the Melbourne office of Harada Industries were now there. Jackson sat at the head of the board table presiding since the rest looked to her when it came to organising and looking after their conditions and things. No surprise then that she had called the meeting. Lauryn Marks, holding her usual serious state, sidled in and took the vacant seat next to Jackson, squeezing behind Annette Kellerman, a smiling redhead, and Pam Burridge, blonde and busty, to reach Jackson's end of the room. So they were all now present. Lauryn had pressed past the tasteful if provocative large format prints of naked Japanese mailgirls posing bound, restrained, and seemingly willing.<br><br>Annette looked around the room admiring the other mailgirls. "I reckon this is the first all nude meeting in the boardroom." She looked around the room. Some of the other mailgirls squirmed.<br><br>Pam owned up to her unease. "I'm okay when I'm like this," she started. Pam even shook her wavy blonde hair, her large breasts shimmered as she looked around at the others. "But I still get a bit self-conscious when someone points it out." She hid her breasts behind her arms as she turned to grimace at Annette, sitting right next to her.<br><br>"Right now no one's getting a mailgirl delivery," Annette chortled, trying to lift the mood.<br><br>"I can think of one or two people who would be glad of that," Jan Stephenson responded as she smiled pointedly over at the temptress Monika Mayhem, "not having to deal with a mailgirl for a short while."<br><br>Monika pretended ignorance. "I can't imagine who you're thinking about?" she told Jan. "If it's my friend Stuart, he loves it, secretly." Everyone laughed at that. There was no evidence that Stuart Broad, a new manager over from the US, enjoyed any of Monika's physical attention.<br><br>But they needed to get to business. Jackson took the floor and started by threatening that she would be going thoroughly through their Enterprise Agreement (EA) to explain their rights in the workplace. And what the management could and could not do to them. She promised that it may not seem very exciting to them. But they had told her they wanted to know. Which was why they were there. "And anyone new who starts here as a mailgirl gets everything that is in the EA," Jackson continued. "So when you started Fanny and when you passed over to the bright side, June, you went straight onto our pay scale — it's on page 69 if you're looking for it — and everyone gets our conditions."<br><br>Unlike all of them except Jackson, Fanny was on a contract. But Jackson explained that the EA still applied to the two of them. June Lockhart, the newest mailgirl, had been working in HR until she turned. So it was a joke whether June had previously been on the dark side or whether that's where she was now. June blushed, not yet quite used to being a nude centre of attention.<br><br>Jackson was in her stride. "Now we get the minimum conditions that everyone gets, four weeks' annual leave, sick leave, public holidays, all that sort of stuff. Then we get to the special mailgirl conditions. First there's our obligation to the company, that we are not going to be wearing any clothes during working hours and how we have to maintain our looks to a certain standard — pages 23 to 29, it's all there. I'm assuming that with the possible exceptions of Fanny and June, none of you have actually read the whole thing?"<br><br>June looked around then quietly addressed Jackson. "I don't know why you think I would have read it."<br><br>"Because you're in HR?"<br><br>June tittered, now more comfortable. "Obviously you haven't spent as much time there as you need to. Like anywhere else, we only read as much of anything as we need to."<br><br>Jackson looked over. "Fanny, you?"<br><br>"Oh, I'll get around to it one day."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "So you guys all really trust me. Amazing." She continued. "So what this all means is that if Jeneva comes over here from the States as she wants to do, she gets paid the same as we do, and she gets all of our benefits." Jeneva was a Harada mailgirl in America. Jackson had promised her she would try to get her to Melbourne, since she really wanted to come.<br><br>"What is Heather's situation?" Annette asked. Feisty Heather McKay had been recruited from the stock room in Melbourne, but she got her wish to be a mailgirl in America.<br><br>"It's a minimum benefits thing," Jackson explained. "When Heather was transferred, she couldn't get paid less than she was here. Plus she kept all her entitlements." Jackson looked around to see if anyone had questions about that. Then she went back to the EA. "The third part starting from Page 30 is what I'll call the perks. So that's the bonus points system, the targets, the limits on how many trips we have to do in a day..."<br><br>"The tribunal?" Jan asked.<br><br>"No, that's in Part 2," Jackson explained. "That's part of the company's obligations to us for us agreeing to be like this. But, and this is the part you've all been waiting for, the stuff in Part 3 is subject to management's continual support, to whether it is financially sustainable. Unfortunately it comes out as discretionary rather than contractual. Which was all good when Mitch was the boss..."<br><br>"He was a good boss," Annette stated.<br><br>"Yes. A very caring boss," Jackson reinforced, smiling at Kimiko. When Jackson smiled you only felt goodness. And so Kimiko smiled back with almost equal warmth. Did she realise how big it was of Jackson to treat her like that? Or did she expect it? Since Jackson had found out that Kimiko was sleeping with her Mitch in the worst possible way.<br><br>But Pam missed their byplay. "Kimiko," she interrupted, "you were in Finance before. How much is this costing the company?" Pam waved her hand around to underline that she was asking about the whole mailgirl operation.<br><br>Kimiko gave Pam a friendly smile, and an ironic laugh. The others also looked to Kimiko, curious. "Haha, a lot," she responded. "Certainly Granddad is blowing a proportion of the family inheritance on this."<br><br>June looked to Annette sitting next to her with a look of confusion. "She's Mr Harada's granddaughter," Annette whispered to the newest mailgirl, who had no way of knowing that.<br><br>Kimiko continued. "The brothers — Granddad's sons — are involved in the company. My mother, no involvement. So this is the only way that I'm going to get my hands on any of it." She crossed her arms and nodded at Jackson that she had said all she intended to on the matter.<br><br>Jackson continued. "And in there is the stuff about protecting our privacy. The company has to make sure no images are leaked, that sort of thing. Our basic pay is in the tables at the end. They have to pay us according to that, and abide by all the stuff up to Page 30. But we have to accept — at least in a straightforward contractual way — that we don't have any rights to stuff that Lindsay has taken away."<br><br>Muttering rose at that. Until Fanny spoke up. "There are always weasel words..."<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "There is always a place in the middle where the two sides need to meet and be sensible. But there's another problem. This plan to bring in mailgirl tourists. It potentially devalues us. And they don't get paid for being us. In fact, the plan is to charge them for the experience."<br><br>After the reporter's turn as a mailgirl for a day, the office boss Lindsay Davenport had floated the idea of charging interested women to be mailgirl for a day in the Harada office, as it was the only place in Melbourne that had mailgirls.<br><br>Pam seemed more worried than the rest of them over that. "So what would happen to us if they decided that they don't need mailgirls any longer? If they can replace all of us with tourists?"<br><br>Jackson thought for a moment before she answered. "It's complicated but essentially, they cannot replace us with tourists. If they have a mailgirl operation in the building they have to have paid mailgirls on the payroll. They cannot replace us with volunteers, the FWC would not let them. Remember, I was talking about the company's obligations?"<br><br>Annette needed to check. "But what is the minimum number of mailgirls they can employ?"<br><br>"That's a complicated question depending on demand and attendance. With the engineers moving onto the eleventh floor it's possible that we still don't have enough even with Monika and June joining us. That's one of the reasons that management are taking Jeneva so seriously."<br><br>Annette kept on. "But if they say wound up the mailgirl program, what would happen?"<br><br>Jackson smiled at her. "Well those of you who were recruited from inside the company — Annette, Jan, Kimiko and Heather, and you of course, June, would be fine. They would have to find you similar work in the company and there are all sorts of rules about your pay rates and conditions and protection of your status and so on. Pam, Monika, you're pretty much okay as well. Since you are permanent employees of the company, they would have to look after you although not quite to the extent of the others."<br><br>Jackson looked over at the short busty Uni-based academic who was there naked experiencing what she had been researching academically. "Fanny and I are a different issue," Jackson continued, "since we came here on contracts. But there's one thing that we need to remember. And that's the reason why Mitch is still working here. They want to keep those of us associated with the program happy. They did not sack Mitch because they don't want him appearing the next week in The Age or The Hun going on about the details of the mailgirls program. And double that for an actual mailgirl doing it and getting her story and her picture in the papers. So long as Mr Harada wants to keep paying for it, we're not going anywhere. Oh, except for Lauryn, sorry."<br><br>Lauryn nodded. They all knew that she was working out her notice, soon to finish as a mailgirl.<br><br>The boardroom door suddenly opened. Jackson stood up to face the intrusion. Lindsay Davenport took two steps in before realising that the table was occupied by naked mailgirls. "Oh," she exclaimed, "that explains why I couldn't get any of you to deliver my messages. I didn't realise the meeting room was booked," the manager of the office added for bad measure. Since Jackson was standing and staring at her, that was who she addressed.<br><br>Jackson tried to be agreeable. "The booking was done and approved," she stated politely.<br><br>Lindsay looked behind her. Jackson could see that Belinda Clarke, the head of HR, and Betty Cuthbert, Lindsay's PA, were standing behind Lindsay, not doubt expecting to follow her in. "I didn't see the booking," Lindsay repeated and turned to get support from Belinda. That did not happen, Belinda kept a noncommittal look on her face. Lindsay was careful enough not to try to get any support from her PA. At least she had worked that out. There was no secret that Betty Cuthbert preferred Mitch.<br><br>Lindsay turned back to Jackson. "Are you going to be long?"<br><br>Jackson smiled and looked around the room. "If you have a moment, we have some questions for you," she told the boss like that was the most reasonable thing to do in the circumstances. Belinda sensing the moment, stepped into the doorway effectively barring Lindsay from leaving. Belinda, the master of charm, blocked her in a way that suggested she was merely being amenable. Taking the hint Betty Cuthbert stepped past Belinda into the room and sidled along the wall behind the seated mailgirls as if she was a required witness or something.<br><br>"All right then," Lindsay snapped. Partly angry because she was physically trapped. And because she could see no alternative to having to deal with these lower ranked staff. With their breasts proudly showing.<br><br>They ask her about Jeneva, about the tourists. But Lindsay deflected. She was taking her time to reach conclusions, she told them, nothing had been decided yet.<br><br>"Have you ever stood in a mailgirl's shoes?" Monika asked her. And got the strangest look in response.<br><br>Then Lindsay bit her lip to take a moment to answer very careful. "I accept that it takes a certain strength to do what you do. And don't think that we don't all appreciate you." That was all she said. Immediately Jackson wondered privately what exactly did Lindsay mean? That is, if she was even being honest and not glib. But the mailgirls felt the unease. There were no more questions. They were done.<br><br>As the mailgirls filed out, June thought about it then decided What The Hell and approached Kimiko who was being polite and letting the other mailgirls leave ahead of her.<br><br>"Sorry to harp on," June started, "but surely you must be in line for at least some inheritance when your grandfather dies?"<br><br>Kimiko shrugged. "Unlikely. Like I said, he placed his two sons in the company and left my mother, the only other sibling, out in the cold. I'm not expecting anything."<br><br>"But does he know about you here?" June felt embarrassed that she resorted to a euphemistic description of them being naked mailgirls in the office.<br><br>Kimiko did not seem offended at all. "Oh, he knows," she assured the newest mailgirl. Who obviously did not know of Mr Harada's visit to Melbourne where he had discovered Kimiko kneeling naked and fully exposed while she waited to be given a message. Kimiko did not share that she had had no interactions with her grandfather since that episode. Of course, he would have seen her at the staff meeting when he was on the VC from Tokyo but he had shown no reaction from what she had seen on the big screen. Not that she had cared at the time. She was taking care of herself in the most satisfying way in the meeting, only interested in her own pleasure.<br><br>Kimiko guessed that she did not need to tell the whole story to June. Someone else would. She looked towards June, crossed her eyes back in her head and stuck her tongue out down to her chin. "Ah," June sniffed, "ahegao. I didn't expect it of you." And they continued down the stairs in silence.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Cara Johnson sat on Sarah's sofa with the morning sun streaming through on her. Cara's twin Emily sat on the carpet facing her sister across the coffee table. "Did the parents say anything about me staying out?" Emily asked her.<br><br>"I'm not sure they noticed," Cara smirked. "Fortunately you told me where you were. In case they asked."<br><br>Sarah came into the room carrying coffees for the twins. "Did I get her in trouble?" she asked Cara while placing the coffees down. She bent down to give Emily a hug from behind.<br><br>Cara shook her head. "Emily gets herself into trouble all by herself, you don't have to worry about that."<br><br>"We were celebrating," Sarah offered Cara carefully. She did have to worry lacking inside knowledge about the sisters. Does one twin get upset if you invite the other one to party and leave Cara at home? She studied Cara for angst. But was sure that she could not find any. "Isn't it exciting, Emily becoming a mailgirl?"<br><br>Cara smiled at Sarah then shook head at her sister. "So it's actually happening?"<br><br>Emily leaned into Sarah who eased herself onto the floor to better grip her lover. "I wish you could come too," she told Cara. "And you too," she smiled at Sarah.<br><br>"Maybe I'll get a real job there and use you relentlessly as my mailgirl," Cara threatened.<br><br>Emily of course saw the upside. "That would be wonderful!"<br><br>Cara got serious. "Do you know anything about the company?"<br><br>"No," Emily admitted. "Shane just said it was similar to Harada." She had already told Cara that her father's former deputy had organised the position for her.<br><br>Cara looked to Sarah then focussed on her sister. "And how much do we know about Harada?"<br><br>Emily thought about that for a moment. "Um, what do we know? Dad works there, Shane works there, they have mailgirls. And they do stuff. Maybe they make stuff." She trailed off, since that was all she knew. Sarah's hands wandered under Emily's t-shirt which Cara seemed fine with. So her hands wandered further.<br><br>"I won't be there to keep an eye on you," Cara warned instead.<br><br>Emily did not see what her twin was getting at. "You weren't there at the Uni caf for my nude mailgirl protest, and I survived that." Sarah lifted Emily's t-shirt over her head. Not surprisingly Emily had nothing on underneath.<br><br>"Em stripped off back when in the Uni caf. A protest against the male hegemony inherent in the mailgirl concept," Cara explained to Sarah. "Isn't that right?" she challenged Emily.<br><br>"Was that you?" Sarah exclaimed. "I should have realised!" She hugged Emily, pressing against her bare breasts. Emily purred as Sarah played with her body.<br><br>"Who else would have done it?" Cara suggested, acting like the make-out session was not happening. Emily grinned then kissed Sarah. "But an office is different to a Uni ref," Cara cautioned. "All those wandering hands, fingers..." Cara even made a cat's paw at Emily as if that was what she should expect once she was away from her sister's protection. Cara's argument though was not helped by Sarah doing to Emily exactly what Cara had described. Emily spread her legs enjoying everything that Sarah was doing to her.<br><br>Cara rolled her eyes and crossed her arms primly. Emily retaliated against that. "You haven't done it in public like me," she scolded her sister. "People tend to respect the naked female form, they admire it rather than attack it." Now kneeling between her legs, Sarah reached up to squeeze Emily's nipples as if that was some sort of confirmation. Emily leant forward to give her assailant a kiss on the lips in thanks then gently pressed Sarah's face into her crotch. "And well," she continued, "who's to say I wouldn't mind a bit of random frigging in the office?"<br><br>Cara shook her head. Was she miffed that only Emily was getting this opportunity. "Anyway, remind me, what's the name of this place?" she asked. Emily looked over at her sister, blissfully vague for a moment as Sarah at her. Eventually Emily gave the name.<br><br>Cara took that in. "I'll google them. Meanwhile since it's mailgirl time, get into position on the floor."<br><br>Emily nodded at Sarah so she got up as Emily took her place kneeling with her legs spread and her back arched. Sarah could not resist it, she pinched the nude mailgirl's nipples. "You like that?" Sarah taunted as she twisted one bud just a little. Emily groaned an "um... yeah..." Cara googled on her phone. "Harada are the fifteen largest engineering company in the world," she read out. "Famechon are eighteenth."<br><br>"Go Famechon! Watch out Harada!" Emily cheered as Sarah let go of her.<br><br>Cara stood up and told Emily to kneel facing her. She then asked Sarah to spread Emily's knees wider and got their friend to then arch Emily's back so that her breasts stood out. Unbidden, Sarah again attacked the naked woman's nipples, ensuring that they stayed hard. Unable to resist, Sarah also reached down between Emily's legs.<br><br>Cara stood close with her arms crossed and stared hard at her sister. "Sounds like it will be great for your CV," she observed drily.<br><br>Emily looked up at her: "Does that matter?"<br><br>Sarah was finding it hard to keep her hands off Emily. She was again working at her nipples, caressing her butt. "She is only hired as an intern," Sarah reminded Cara while getting another groan of pleasure from Emily.<br><br>"True," Cara observed. "There are still possibilities if you want to be something other than a mailgirl."<br><br>Emily looked quizzical. "Are you saying that's bad?" she wondered.<br><br>"Just keep your options open," Cara suggested.<br><br>"That's not all she needs to keep open," Sarah observed as she worked one hand on Emily's exposed clit. Emily responded almost right away.<br><br>Cara shook her head as the two lovers kissed, one completely clothed taking whatever liberties she wanted with the naked one. "I'm almost jealous," Cara admitted. She hesitated for a moment. Then she sat back down and watched.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The mailgirls were getting ready for their workday, on the mezzanine. Jackson came out from the showers into the general area where she could be seen from the floors above, towelling her hair dry. Pam was already out there preening herself, teasing her long blonde hair.<br><br>"You got to the hair dryers first?" Jackson jested because, well, Pam always did.<br><br>"I don't know why they can't give us more power outlets in there," Pam shrugged. "Means that the others wouldn't have to line up behind me." She admired Jackson for a moment. "And of course with your short bob..."<br><br>"...I don't need to wait for the hair dryer..." Jackson laughed.<br><br>"Inspection!" called out Wendy Turnbull, their supervisor, as she got up from her desk to walk over to the pair of mailgirls. June and Monika came out from the showers to join them. "Who's left?" Wendy asked.<br><br>"Only Annette," Monika advised.<br><br>"Quite a few away," Wendy noted.<br><br>"All with valid reasons," Jackson rebounded. She sounded more confident than she was. Five present out of the cohort of nine was not great. Fanny was still on study leave. But the other three? Jackson noted that Wendy was not going to challenge her assertion.<br><br>"If we get too busy you could strip off and help out," Pam told Wendy.<br><br>Wendy had other things on her mind than that continuing taunt. "Can you lot please line up?" she pleaded. "I get the blame if the audience up there think that you look too sloppy when I do this." She did not need to add that she was as unenthusiastic for the inspection as they were. But she could point out, it was less onerous — and had less consequences for the mailgirls — than in other mailgirl offices.<br><br>The mailgirls mumbled quietly as they assembled into a line facing the viewing windows on the upper floors. For whatever reason they had a larger than usual audience watching. Wendy first of all walked behind the mailgirls, checking each one in turn.<br><br>"You're not wearing rubber gloves today," Annette called out. Wendy never wore rubber gloves. It was just another of the taunts that she had to put up with. She always slightly bristled at that one though. Wendy never touched the mailgirls during inspection unless she absolutely had to. And that was rare. Usually just to inspect a skin blemish, a bruise or acne, anything like that. Today though they were clear from the back. Wendy made her way around to face the mailgirls for the next stage. She knew to play to the gallery, take her time. She had learned that keeping the mailgirls in a straight line, breasts thrust out, having to silently wait for her to announce that the inspection was over earned her kudos from Lindsay. Plus she privately enjoyed the few moments of control that she could maintain over them, even if it was only a few moments before they again got lippy with her. Still she hoped that they appreciated how she respected the boundaries. Proud that she did not getting handsy with them when she could.<br><br>After the inspection, Wendy returned to her desk. Jackson spent a moment with the other mailgirls, around the chairs, not yet deciding whether to sit and display. Maybe they were about to get their first delivery jobs of the morning? Or they may have a quiet start. Annette and Monika returned to the shower area. No one seemed fussed by that. Sensing her moment, Jackson stepped quickly over to Wendy's desk. "So the three definitely said that they would not be in today?" she asked their supervisor as she sat back down.<br><br>Wendy looked up at the mailgirl. "Four," she corrected.<br><br>"Fanny has the whole week off," Jackson replied to which Wendy agreed. "But the others? After what I said during the inspection, I just wanted to be sure."<br><br>Wendy logged back into her PC. "Yes," she confirmed, "all away and accounted for." Jackson spoke her thanks and walked back to rejoin the other mailgirls.<br><br>Annette came out of the shower area. Jackson approached her before she could rejoin the group."Jan has shown you how hack the app, I think you told me?" Jackson confirmed with her.<br><br>Annette gave Jackson a leery smile. "Ah, she's away today. Would this be about Mitch?" she asked, knowingly.<br><br>"Might be," Jackson confessed.<br><br>Annette gave her fellow a shoulder squeeze. "I'll see what I can do," she agreed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson rehearsed what she wanted to say to Mitch on the way up the stairs. 'Why didn't you tell me?' sounded pathetic. 'I thought we had something, you and me' sounded worse. Why was she even doing this? She would try being nice to Mitch, Jackson decided, and see what happens from there.<br><br>Mitch looked up when Jackson stepped into his office. "Did I call a mailgirl?" he started before he realised with an "Oh." Jackson smiled trying to ease her tension as she walked up close to Mitch. He gestured for her to sit opposite, so she did.<br><br>"It's been hard for me, Mitch," she started hoping that was the right note.<br><br>Mitch looked away from Jackson, over at the wall, she guessed. "It's been hard for me too," he offered.<br><br>That caught Jackson by surprise. "Sure, it must be really hard having to fuck that stunning Asian woman," Jackson snapped back. She realised that Mitch was trying to look conciliatory. "Sorry," she mumbled.<br><br>"Do you want something?" Mitch tried.<br><br>Jackson rocked back in her seat and looked Mitch in the eyes. "Like what?"<br><br>Mitch shimmied, trying to be the nice guy. "You know."<br><br>Jackson was not giving an inch. "Spell it out," she insisted.<br><br>Mitch took in a deep breath. "Well, if we invite in one or two of your friends, I could have you spread yourself out on the desk..."<br><br>Jackson cocked her head like she was listening to an interesting cooking recipe. "And?" she challenged. Sitting as she was across the desk from Mitch, she was visible above the waist, her breasts bobbing slowly as she readjusted herself in the seat. Was she squirming thinking how Mitch pleasured her in past? If so, Jackson was not letting on, keeping a straight face, not a smile or a frown. Mitch would have to work harder for a reaction.<br><br>Mitch tried to connect with Jackson, give her a caring look. But she did not accept it. She enjoyed the moment, him trying to be good to her. "If you let me, I could pleasure you with my tongue, my fingers, my hands..." he stammered.<br><br>Jackson tilted her head and this time stared into Mitch's eyes. "Would Kimiko allow you to do it?" she asked.<br><br>Mitch relaxed, lulled by Jackson's eye contact. "Well, she's pretty kinky. So I'm sure she wouldn't mind, even if she was here." Jackson's face tightened. Mitch did notice. "I shouldn't have said that, should I?" he backpedalled.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "Probably don't give me the details," she fired back sardonically.<br><br>Mitch still felt a connection. "So I better not complain about the hard time that Jessica is giving me about her," he blathered.<br><br>Jackson looked surprised. "You don't do this affair thing very well, do you?"<br><br>Mitch continued. "She was prepared for me to have an affair with you. Just not Kimiko."<br><br>Jackson sat up straighter than she was. She still had her legs together. "Mitch," she warned, "you're really not doing yourself any favours. You do realise?"<br><br>Mitch seemed to realise but still wanted to connect with the mailgirl he had been so close to. "I take it that's a no then?"<br><br>Jackson put her hands on the desk for support and stood up, staring down at Mitch. No clear view of her bust now, obscured behind her arms. "Hard no," she snapped. Nothing for him, no touching, that was clear.<br><br>They stayed that way silently for a moment, both wondering what the next step was. Would Jackson turn and walk out? Would Mitch say something to make it right? Shane walked in without knocking. "I can see this is a bad time," he quickly surmised, "so let me make it worse... or better." And he grinned, that Shane grin.<br><br>Clearly Shane was ogling Jackson from behind. He stopped a few steps away his gaze firmly fixed on her bottom and he even whistled, so that Jackson turned around and clocked what he was doing with a scowl. "Can you stop that please Shane?" she demanded.<br><br>Not that Shane was abashed. "Something's changed about your rear view. And for the better too, I'd have to say. If you ever get over Mitch, you know where I am."<br><br>"That's somewhere that I won't be going," Jackson warned him.<br><br>"You came here with news?" Mitch reminded Shane curtly. "Something that we're either going to love or hate?"<br><br>"That's right," Shane smiled like he had received the warmest of greetings from the other two. "I've just come out of a meeting with Lindsay..."<br><br>"So it's bad news," Mitch concluded.<br><br>"Not so fast," Shane urged. "Let me at least tell you before you get upset. I don't know, I think you might like it." He stared at Jackson's tight bottom again.<br><br>And again Jackson prickled as she noticed. "Oh, get on with it," she ordered.<br><br>Shane smiled. "We're aiding another mailgirl start-up. Here in Melbourne. Famechon Engineering."<br><br>"The fuck!" Jackson exclaimed. She straight away began to calculate all the ways that another mailgirl set-up would undermine all the employment conditions she had got for the Melbourne Harada workers. "They've kept that a secret!" she huffed. Then she looked to Mitch who certainly seemed non-committal.<br><br>Shane could not help himself. "You're gorgeous when you're angry," he admired.<br><br>Something snapped. She could be naked and relaxed with Mitch, play off him, be sarcastic, be in control. But Shane? Jackson turned and glared at Shane. "No one calls me gorgeous when I'm angry!" she snapped. She glared at Mitch. "No one!"<br><br>Mitch was wondering where this was all going to end when June strode in through the open door to Mitch's office. That drew the attention of all three of the combatants to her. The newest mailgirl looked a little sheepish as she composed herself. Then she looked to Jackson. "Thank God I finally found you. Lindsay wants you in a meeting with her and Belinda. Something about a new mailgirls opportunity. A start-up?" June looked like she had said all that she knew.<br><br>Jackson nodded at the other naked woman in the room. "Uh huh, when?" she asked.<br><br>June looked at her app. "In about seven minutes. I've been looking for you for ages, sorry."<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "Well, I better get down there, thanks."<br><br>She started out of the room when June grabbed her by the wrist. "Sorry," June faltered, "but I am new here. What's the deal when a mailgirl is sent to get another mailgirl. Do you sign it off?"<br><br>Jackson actually looked perplexed. She had to think for a moment. All the while June held her arm. Which Jackson realised was sending strange feelings right through her body. "I don't actually know. I don't think we thought of that." Shane laughed. "What?" Jackson demanded. Fuck, she was getting so turned on. Keep control girl, she ordered herself. Which did not help. June's contact did not help. She gently shook June's hand off before she totally succumbed.<br><br>Shane almost could not get the words out for chortling. "Imagine. You mailgirls could spend all day calling each other to deliver messages amongst yourselves. That would stuff things right up." He laughed. None of the others did. "Well," Shane concluded, "at least you would make quota."<br><br>Jackson stared at Shane. Clearly he could not recognise when a mailgirl was turned on. She stepped close to him wondering if he could smell her arousal. But no, his smirk did not fall. He just stared. So she kept on her way out of the office. But she stopped and turned at the door to look at June. "I'm sure you've heard, but you have to be careful of that one. Or maybe not. I guess it's your call." And she left to find out what the management wanted of her.<br><br>June walked up to Shane and stroked his arm. "Whatever could she mean?" June cooed which did appear out of kilter with her somewhat conventional appearance.<br><br>But something in her large brown eyes appealed to Shane who stroked her arm in return. "Do you need some relief?" he asked June who licked her lips in response. Shane turned to Mitch. "With all respect to your office," he told his friend as he gripped June around the waist and let one hand start to linger downwards, "I guess Mitch you can either watch or give us a few moments of privacy." June pressed herself again onot Shane while he felt around her crotch, guessing correctly how to turn her on. He pressed her lips together in his grip as she embraced him, gently biting his neck.<br><br>Shane looked to Mitch to make his decision. Voyeur or privacy. Mitch shook his head in amazement. "I guess I do need another coffee. Would either of you two like me to get you one while I'm out?"<br><br>Neither of them answered since their mouths were busy as they deeply kissed each other with Shane moving them carefully towards the well used couch. Mitch stood up to get away and give them their space. Well actually, his space.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Rosemary Millwall did not want to see Peter Burge. She knew how it would go. She knew how it would end. The executive producer had asked to see her in the editing booth at 10am sharp. First thing, she had to be there on time. She was. In fact she was a few minutes early. Peter Burge barged into the room his eyes set with determination.<br><br>"Cappuccino extra hot," Rosemary told him, pointing to the two coffees sitting there on the desk.<br><br>"I've gone off the chocolate," Peter huffed, "but thanks, I'll have it anyway." He gripped the cup, sipped through the lid and nodded a grudging appreciation. "You know what I want," he growled, wiping his lip.<br><br>"A segment," Rosemary intoned.<br><br>"Ideally." He looked at the reporter and read her face correctly. "There isn't one. Yet." he confirmed. She didn't need to respond to that, he was right. "Rough cut?" he asked.<br><br>"Not yet." Rosemary tried to look defiant. She knew that was futile. Even though she was determined to not offer up her body or any footage of it until she absolutely had to.<br><br>"What did you get up to in there?" Peter asked roughly. But it was a fair question. Rosemary did not answer. And then she broke eye contact, fatally. "You didn't, did you?" he asked with what may have almost been a smile, a sudden superiority on his face. "Oh, so that's the problem? Our reporter bared all for the story." He brightened right up. "I can see the ratings now. See our number one mean girl totally starkers, one night only. That will give you a whole new audience."<br><br>Rosemary crossed her arms calmly knowing that she had the executive producer alone in the booth. "Don't talk to me like that," she spat out at him. "On your knees."<br><br>"What do you mean?" Peter may have been trembling when he asked her. He knelt in front of his reporter.<br><br>Rosemary stood over him. "You want something from me. But you need to pay the price first. Get ready to be used the way that you would use me if you had the balls."<br><br>"Time for a lesson," Rosemary added as she undid her pants and slid them down, followed quickly by her skimpy briefs, not giving her boss any chance to salivate over her new state. Peter knelt and looked up at her, not sure what to expect now that the reporter was in charge. She stepped up close to him, her pussy at his eye level. "Now get to work and make it good!" she ordered. And he obeyed.<br><br>From her desk outside the editing room, Trisha Noble, Rosemary's assistant, watched Peter leave, noting the strange look on his face as he rushed past her. It seemed like determination combined with an intent not to speak to anyone as he quickly departed. At the door to the suite, Rosemary beckoned her to come in.<br><br>"He harassed you?" Trisha asked the reporter with some concern as Rosemary closed the door behind her.<br><br>Rosemary smiled her dangerous smile. "The opposite," she replied enigmatically, "I bought us sone time." Trisha looked confused. Rosemary smiled warmly now. "Watch and learn," she told her assistant. She started footage on the editing screen of the all-powerful Peter Burge on his knees in front of the reporter.<br><br>Trisha started to realise. "You taped it?" she asked.<br><br>Rosemary grinned wide. "Of course."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson, Annette, Pam and Jan were standing around on the mezzanine all watching the entrance to the showers, clearly waiting. Meanwhile Kimiko, typically, was working on her laptop having dragged one of the display chairs off to her favourite corner. Where she could maintain her distance and concentrate on whatever she had on her screen. June and Monika stood a little away having a quiet conversation. Fanny was absent, still on study leave. Wendy as usual kept an eye on the mailgirls from her desk until she was required to do her duty with the morning inspection.<br><br>Suddenly Lauryn appeared from the showers naked and little cautious.<br><br>Jackson quickly went up to her friend and gently took her arm in her hand. "Last time," she swooped, not letting Lauryn go. Lauryn smiled back at her friend as they stood together naked, bittersweet at the start of her last nude mailgirl day. Lauryn the taller of the two stooped a little to match Jackson's height so they could truly share the moment.<br><br>The other mailgirls cheered. Well, all but Kimiko who at least glanced up from her laptop and smiled.<br><br>"Last time," Lauryn agreed, looking into her friend's eyes. Then she gazed about at the other mailgirls who pressed towards her to each give her a hug in turn. She was a little tense, a bit cautious. Had they arranged something around this event? Would she want it, would she have to pretend to enjoy some ceremony or surprise? She did though feel something and let a tear swell in her eye, drop down her cheek. Jackson noticed and tenderly wiped it away.<br><br>"I can only imagine," Jackson tried. "Does it feel weird?" Jackson looked into the eyes of her friend and sometime lover and felt that she did not need to hold back. She hugged Lauryn. The other mailgirls knew, they had backed off after their brief caresses.<br><br>"Yes," Lauryn agreed, "it feels weird." If pushed, she would have to admit that at that moment she felt numb. Naked in her workplace for the last day before returning to normality. It would take some time to get over the experience, she knew. But she had known for a while that she was ambivalent about her nude workplace routine. And she wondered now what had caused her to agree to go from having a stable job at Harada as a Business Analyst to being, well, on display and available in a way that she had never really considered. Her choice, she knew, but still.<br><br>Lauryn looked down at her body. She was proud of her firm breasts, her flat torso, her long legs, the neat tuft of hair above her well visible lips. She rubbed her firm butt. Somehow she had agreed to display herself around the office every day. Lauryn looked over at the other mailgirls, June who was still a bit soft and curvy, but others all thin and strong and strappingly female.<br><br>Wendy clapped her hands. "Inspection," she called out. The eight strode to their agreed spot on the mezzanine where they lined up, in full view of the upper floors waiting for Wendy to review them. She walked slowly down the line looking for untidy hair, for blemishes. Today she found nothing, gave no warnings. Although she did touch Lauryn on the shoulder and give her a quick nod. "You're all good to go," she announced breezily. "Enjoy the day!" Well, she had tried.<br><br>The calls came soon enough. Annette was buzzed first, the first to stride out of the mezzanine towards the stairs. Kimiko was the second.<br><br>Lauryn gripped her friend's arm noting that Jackson had visibly stiffened as Kimiko disappeared on her call. "You don't know," Lauryn tried to help the other mailgirl.<br><br>"That's exactly the problem," Jackson admitted, "I don't know." Had Mitch called Kimiko to his office. And if so, what were they getting up to? A buzzing interrupted them. They both looked to their apps.<br><br>Lauryn rolled her eyes. "It's me," she announced. "Shane." She stood up.<br><br>"First one of the countdown," Jan called over to Lauryn as she did a few stretches before tackling the stairs. "Warming up!" Jan taunted lightly.<br><br>"Hate to strain a calf or something on the last day," Lauryn replied. The others tutted their hopes that it wouldn't happen to her — or to any of them for that matter.<br><br>Lauryn knocked on Shane's door and entered. "You have a message?" she asked, as neutral as she could be.<br><br>Shane was on his lounge holding his phone. "I do," he replied trying to look as sweet as could be. He even patted the couch next to him. "How about a parting thing?" he suggested.<br><br>Lauryn smiled at him. "Thing?" she asked like she had absolutely no idea.<br><br>Shane smiled back like she was acquiescing. "I thought you and I had something."<br><br>Lauryn shook her head with a smile, the audacity of the man. "Some... thing," she measured back at him, still shaking her head. "It was only twice. And you know, I had almost forgotten about it. And then there's before. You did not exactly help my career back in the fabric days."<br><br>Shane tried his puppy dog eyes. "I have changed," he insisted.<br><br>Lauryn looked bemused. "Into what? A mailgirls fucking machine?"<br><br>Shane did not seem to be perturbed. "In that case, I just have a message for you to deliver to Mitch." He gave it to her. Something about golf. "And I hope you can at least accept my wishes," he added, "that I really do hope that you succeed in your new job. Are we okay?"<br><br>Lauryn nodded. After all, she really had nothing against Shane. It was just fun to push back at him. And now she would be able to tell Jackson on her return whether Kimiko was with Mitch. As it turned out, Mitch was on his own when Lauryn delivered Shane's message.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>They were all back on the mezzanine after a few hours of activity. Kimiko got a call on her app, and in her usual self-contained way she trod out of the mezzanine without looking at or talking to any of the others. She did not mind Lauryn. Kimiko just felt the inevitability that tomorrow Lauryn would not be there working as a mailgirl, come the next week she would not be there, and likely after that Kimiko would not think about her. Right now she would see what Lindsay wanted.<br><br>With Kimiko gone, Lauryn stared at Jackson, read her angst, and shook her head. "I give up. Who will tell you that you are being an idiot over Mitch when I'm gone?"<br><br>Jackson gave her friend a helpless look. "Probably all of them?"<br><br>Annette got a call and also left. "Busy, girls," she smiled as she exited the room.<br><br>Pam looked at her app. She too had been called. "Lunchtime rush," she wondered as she went.<br><br>Jackson's app went off. She looked and then rolled her eyes at Lauryn. "Shane," she announced as she stood up. "He must have decided that he does not want another go-round with you."<br><br>Lauryn smiled back. "Maybe I would have said yes this time," she laughed.<br><br>"I'll tell him that when I get there," Jackson teased and left before Lauryn could add anything further.<br><br>Lauryn plonked down on a display seat, alone, by herself. It was almost lunchtime, her last lunchtime, and here she was, by herself, with no plans and no one to make any arrangements with. She stretched her hands above her head on the display seat aware that her legs were spread wide and she was as the seat was intended, on full display to anyone looking down from the higher floors. Well at least there was not too long to go. And then she would have to adapt to a world where she was not so blatantly on display in the workplace. Alone, she could admit that showing herself off so wantonly was a turn on. She thought of having a wank, since why not. But her app buzzed. She looked at it with horror. Lindsay had called her for a message. She had hoped that she could keep away from her one for just this one more day. Apparently not.<br><br>Lauryn did think about ignoring the call. It was her last day, what could they do, withhold her final pay? Maybe they could, she wondered, make her fight for it or something. So she dragged herself up from the display chair and off to the stairs.<br><br>Strangely, Lauryn felt seriously exposed when she stepped out onto the sixth floor. Of course she knew the way to Lindsay's office. She wondered what she would do if she saw anyone on the way there. For the first time in ages she wanted to cover up, a hand over her crotch, with the other shielding her breasts. She did not want them to look. She could just be a mailgirl delivering a message point to point no interruption. How fucked up was that? Just as well she was finishing today. But no doubt Lindsay would have an errand for her that would feed into this new vulnerability. If someone upset her, would she use the tribunal, have to come back after today, strip off to get her justice? She started to fear that she would not escape being a mailgirl as easily as she had hoped.<br><br>Lindsay's PA, Betty Cuthbert, was as usual busy at something on her screen when Lauryn arrived at her desk. Betty did not look up, probably did not realise that Lauryn was standing there nude, the mailgirl fretting about having to wait until she gave a little cough to stir the PA.<br><br>"Just a moment," Betty Cuthbert told her without looking up. Lauryn stood there, balancing on her toes to try to blanket her embarrassment at being kept waiting like that by this fully clothed PA. Eventually Betty looked up. "You're here because?" she asked blandly.<br><br>"Lindsay?" Lauryn asked her.<br><br>"Oh, she's in the boardroom," Betty told her as she went back to her screen.<br><br>Lauryn trudged back the way she had come in and around the corridor to the boardroom. She went to open the door wondering who Lindsay had in there. Would she be casually on display to whoever Lindsay was meeting there having to stand around to be examined by everyone while Lindsay took her time to give the mailgirl the message and the instructions? She started to feel sour in the mouth. And hungry.<br><br>She opened the boardroom door.<br><br>Lauryn took a moment to realise the situation. Lindsay stood at the other end of the room behind the head of the board table. Around the table were all her colleagues. All of them. On the table was a luncheon spread.<br><br>"Surprise!" the mailgirls all shouted. Lauryn stood there open mouthed.<br><br>Jackson stood up to take Lauryn by the hand. "We thought you would want to be in the middle of the table, by me," Jackson told her. Lauryn let Jackson lead her to the seat that they had saved. "Shall I dish up?" Jackson asked her. "I know what you like," she added. Lauryn was still speechless as she sat down, so Jackson grabbed a plate which she started to fill for her. Having looked after Lauryn, Jackson looked across the table at Kimiko who seemed a little aloof, like she was above it all. Jackson gave her a friendly smile. "I'll dish up for you too, if you want Kimiko. I know what you would like too." They had all been waiting.<br><br>Kimiko startled then decided 'whatever'. She nodded. "Thanks," she told Jackson directly to her face. "That would be nice."<br><br>After they had eaten, Lindsay tapped a glass to cut the chat. She smiled, like she really meant it, Lauryn marvelled. Lindsay had seemed at home during the meal, the sole fabric as she fraternised with the naked group while picking at the spread.<br><br>"This is the first time we have had to do this," Lindsay started, still smiling. " Unfortunately. One of our most valued colleagues is leaving us, we hope for a better opportunity. But..." She looked around the room, "you are all so lucky to have this opportunity here." Now she had their attention. "I am impressed at the level of female empowerment in the workplace this cohort have displayed. You have shown solidarity, loyalty and diligence to a level that, I will be candid, I never expected of you. And that goes for all of you, both individually and collectively." She looked at Lauryn. "That is why we are sad to see you go. You are a vital part of this program and you will be missed." Lindsay looked around until she settled on Annette. "Annette," she smiled, "you know."<br><br>Annette did know. She reached under the table for two bottles of champagne and a box of glasses. The usual fun and games of opening the champagne, pouring it, and making sure that everyone had a glass ensued. So then Lindsay in her apparent new role as promoter of the mailgirls led the toast to Lauryn. Glasses were refilled, no one was in a hurry to leave. Lindsay circulated talking to each of the mailgirls, implying that she knew all about each of them and she cared.<br><br>She reached Lauryn and leaned in to talk to her. "I know you wanted to pursue your BA career," she told Lauryn. "I hope that this time as a mailgirl has increased your confidence and determination." Maybe it has, Lauryn wondered. Was Lindsay right?<br><br>Lindsay looked back across the table. "Annette, the other thing," she called out. Annette again knew and lifted a large frame from under the table while the others looked on. Annette went over to hand it to Lindsay, who went over to stand with Lauryn. "One last speech," Lindsay promised. "This is to commemorate your biggest achievement here. It's something that we will all remember of you. So it's something for you to remember us by."<br><br>Lindsay handed Lauryn the frame which contained the front cover of Lauryn's report recommending a green solution, the one which brought over a billion dollars in new contracts. What could Lauryn do? She took the gift, shook her head and smiled. And smiled.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jessica Johnson leaned back in her seat. "Well, you can certainly see the world from up here," she smiled at Holly Crawford. "How did you get a reservation?"<br><br>Holly laughed. "The usual way. Money. And a promise to give Monsieur a few choice stories about a certain workplace."<br><br>Jessica looked concerned. "What do you know about it? What has Shane told you?"<br><br>Holly smiled. "Next to nothing. He doesn't tell me much. But a girl has ideas. And I'm expecting you have a few of your own. I suspect you've been thrown morsels too." She affected a superior tone, mocking their husbands: "Don't worry, us men know how to handle ourselves around naked office girls."<br><br>Jessica laughed. "Something like that," she agreed.<br><br>"So you have no qualms about spending Mitch and Shane's hard-earned on this experience?"<br><br>"It's my turn, my treat, I thought."<br><br>"Let's go Dutch, spread the pain. Let both the boys know what they're up for, if they check the statements."<br><br>Jessica knew exactly why she was spending her husband's money on this extravagance. She wondered what issues Holly had with Shane. Well, she could ask.<br><br>But Holly got in first. "Something was definitely up with you two at dinner," she observed.<br><br>Jessica acted startled. "It was that obvious?" She laughed like it was nothing, then like it was not nothing.<br><br>Holly immediately picked up on that. "Is it the mailgirls?" she asked her friend.<br><br>Jessica explained the on-going threat of Jackson. She described as much about Mitch pleasuring Jackson as she could recall from his admissions to her. And then how that relatively tame situation was suddenly bulldozed by the real issue with Kimiko. She neglected to mention her mailboy schooling of Mitch. But she did advise Holly that Mitch would just come straight out with stories about what he was doing with the mailgirls in the office.<br><br>Holly shook her head in amazement. "I guess I should be surprised at a man actually admitting not only what he is getting up to, but also what he wants to get up to." She thought about it for a moment. "But then that's Mitch all over. Thinks if he tell it straight everything will be all right. The twins obviously know. How are they taking it?"<br><br>Jessica shrugged. "They're clever Uni students. Too clever. They seem to see us as an amusing soap opera."<br><br>The two wives had a moment to stretch between courses. When the next one arrived Holly took a moment then smiled. "Ah, Monsieur!" she exclaimed.<br><br>He sat down at their table, a smile on his face. "You must tell me everything!" he insisted.<br><br>Jessica looked to Holly who seemed to encourage her to tell their host their story. She looked over to Monsieur. "Would you believe that our husbands work for a company where naked women deliver messages around the office?"<br><br>He looked amused. "I heard stories. But I thought they were a myth, a legend." He thought for a moment. "These women..." he started.<br><br>"...mailgirls..." Holly helped out.<br><br>"...how many of these 'mail' girls have your husbands slept with?" he asked. It seemed that he was good with the Continental myth that a man sleeping with many women was a good thing.<br><br>The women however were not taken aback by his support for their husbands' infidelities. "Well, my husband's only bedded one," Jessica stated with confidence. Monsieur raised an eyebrow.<br><br>"I think they have about eight or nine there," Holly quickly added. "Knowing Shane, he would have indiscriminately fucked at least half of them." She really emphasised the word 'fucked' in her statement. Monsieur nodded.<br><br>"Holly!" Jessica exclaimed. "Do you know? How do you put up with it?" she demanded. This side of Shane was appatently news to her.<br><br>Holly smiled widely. "Jess, how do you think I put up with it?" Jessica said nothing as she tried to work out an answer. Realising her friend's confusion, Holly knew that she would have to explain. "Let me tell you a story, one as old as time. Shane and I met at Uni. You know when we started going out. Well, one day I dropped round to his unexpectedly. And I found him, well, you can guess."<br><br>"I didn't know this. I don't recall you and Shane splitting up in Uni."<br><br>"That's because we didn't. I went out and had some, well, fun. And I sent him some photos of it. Nice ones, very tasteful. To make it clear to him what I thought."<br><br>Jessica wavered for a moment. Then she regained her voice. "What did he do?" she quivered.<br><br>Holly smiled back warmly. "He sent me some equally tasteful photos in return. That were clearly not of the girl that I had caught him with. Sort of both of us saying 'take it or leave it.' So what could I do but laugh?"<br><br>Monsieur laughed. "This is why I run this place. To learn lessons like this." Jessica gave him a strange look. "A relationship built on open honesty," he beamed.<br><br>"Exactly," Holly added.<br><br>Jessica needed to understand. "So do you still..." She could not finish although Holly clearly understood what she wanted to ask.<br><br>"It is actually true, it does keep the relationship fresh," Holly explained. She leaned across the table. "When we're finished here, do you feel like having some revenge sex?" She leant away in her seat in case of a moral backlash.<br><br>Jessica considered the proposition. Sometimes she was so serious about life, everything. But she relaxed. "Where are we going to find some appropriate men at this hour?" Practical Jessica to the fore.<br><br>Holly stared sympathetically at her friend. "Appropriate, haha. Leave it to me." She nudged Jessica and gestured over at Monsieur."<br><br>"You must be kidding," Jessica exploded.<br><br>Holly crossed her arms as if she was taking umbrage. "The cook, the wife..." she started. They both laughed at that.<br><br>"And if I told you I was thinking about it?" Jessica tried.<br><br>"I would tell you not to think. It's not like Mitch is," Holly automatically replied. "thinking, that is."<br><br>"How did I know you'd say that?" Jessica tried.<br><br>"And if I said that I would march you into his back office?"<br><br>Jessica sighed. "Do I have any alternative?" She kind of knew that Holly was cutting off her excuses. And after all, Mitch had done it all on his own. She sighed again but louder, in defeat. Or maybe victory. After all, if it worked for Holly...<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The mailgirls filed back down to the mezzanine. Monika spoke up first. "I don't know if I can climb the stairs again today after that spread." The others laughed.<br><br>"It wasn't just the spread," Pam added. "What was Lindsay on about? That speech!"<br><br>Annette looked over to Lauryn. "You made her do it. What with your leaving today. Or do you have something on her?"<br><br>"I wish," Lauryn laughed. "Maybe she actually liked me."<br><br>"Unlikely," Jan retorted. "I still don't believe that she likes any of us. What do you think Jackson?"<br><br>Jackson knew that sooner or later the other mailgirls would expect her to offer what they would accept was the definitive view of what was going on. Informal leader and all that. "Would you believe that I don't know what to think about that," she started. "My initial thought was that she actually does have some respect for us but thinks that tough love is the way to, I don't know, organise us. That's taking her at face value."<br><br>A few of the others cast some "hmms" in the air like they could agree with that. Then June gave a polite cough. Jackson turned and smiled at her. "You have something?" she asked openly.<br><br>June stepped towards the group. "I know that I have only been here five minutes and you have all seen much more than I have..." She tailed off with that.<br><br>"Go on," Annette urged. "You're the one with the fresh eyes."<br><br>"What about me?" Monika complained.<br><br>Pam shook her head at Monika. "You came here with an old head on your shoulders. And if you weren't already cynical enough, you spent half your time with that arch cynic Stuart."<br><br>Monika shrugged. "Fair cop," she agreed. And looked to June. "Go on, sorry."<br><br>June smiled back at Monika, took in the attention of the rest of the mailgirls and continued. "Let's take it back to basics. Lindsay came here from The States where the mailgirls are subjugated, they are on low wages and don't have any of the conditions that we do here. Some of them may even be on golden handcuffs or some other form of coercion to stay there..."<br><br>"Golden handcuffs?" Monika asked.<br><br>June got into her stride. "They are offered health insurance or student debt relief, something like that up front. But if they leave before a certain time they have to pay it all back to the company. So they can't quit if they want to because they can't afford to pay the company back. Therefore they have to put up with what they decide to do to her." Monika nodded her understanding. "That would probably be illegal here," June continued, "so Lindsay has to treat us, well carefully. Because she can't do what they do with the mailgirls there. But she tries... Well you all know what she is usually like to us here. But today this is a turnaround for her. She seemed be saying that we are just like her in the organisation, she was trying to identify with us as it were, saying we are all equal or something..."<br><br>"Which is where it stops making sense," Annette pointed out.<br><br>June continued. "Unless she has found a way to accept us on the same level as her..."<br><br>"Or she has found a new way to fuck us," Monika interrupted.<br><br>"That's exactly what I'm talking about," Pam told Monika. "I wish I was as cynical as you." She looked over to Jackson. "What do you think?" she asked her.<br><br>"I still don't know," Jackson admitted. "Monika may be onto something. I guess we all just need to be careful."<br><br>"Well, I don't have to be careful," Lauryn mocked, spreading her arms out dramatically, displaying all of herself to her equally naked colleagues. "Only a few hours to go now." Lauryn spun around almost a pirouette, like she was already feeling free. "I'm going to say goodbye to the office," she announced. Annette and Jackson both stood up. "No, she insisted, "it's something that I want to do by myself." She saw that they were disappointed not to be part of her fun. "We'll have some fun when I get back," she told them. "I promise." She walked out of the mezzanine.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Lauryn strode up to Michael Clarke's desk. The one in the BA's department that faced her old desk which she knew still had not been filled, no one had been hired to replace her. Oh well, that was not her problem. She felt brazen. Her self-consciousness was well over. Michael looked embarrassed to see her which only emboldened her to plonk herself on his desk then slowly turn to face him, opening her legs as she did.<br><br>Michael looked at her crotch which he could barely avoid then looked her in the face. "It's been a treat working with you, Lauryn," he started.<br><br>"Michael!" she exclaimed.<br><br>"What?" he responded, worried.<br><br>"A treat? Really?"<br><br>Michael backtracked. "I didn't mean like that." Then he saw her smile that she had been winding him up. "Okay, maybe I did," he admitted sheepishly.<br><br>"Well, maybe we'll work together again," Lauryn suggested.<br><br>"You don't have to worry if we do," Michael replied. Lauryn looked confused. "The mailgirl thing," he started to explain, "you don't have to worry about it getting out."<br><br>"I can trust you," Lauryn stated.<br><br>"Oh you can trust everyone," Michael advised. Then he saw Lauryn needed an explanation. "Lindsay just put out an email. Have a read." Lauryn took the opportunity to slide around and rest her arm on his shoulder as she did. She even tickled his ear then nodded to him with a very close smile when she was done reading. Michael held her stare. "So you see, Lauryn, no one is going to refer to your mailgirl time outside of this office. Or else."<br><br>"Big sanctions," Lauryn stated, still staring at the email.<br><br>"Big sanctions," Michael agreed.<br><br>Lauryn leaned closer so that her nose was a centimetre from Michael's. "Since it's my last day can you do something for me?" Michael may have been wondering what he could do. But Lauryn had taken his hand and placed it just inside her bare thigh.<br><br>"Are you sure?" he asked her. Lauryn nodded so he moved that hand just a little way around to the side of her mound. She smiled as he started to stroke her slit. "You're wet," he realised. Of course she was. Lauryn groaned as Michael rubbed her harder and closer. "Tongue," she whimpered, spreading her legs wider. Michael leaned forward. Replacing his fingers with his mouth was easy with her spread out on his desk, in exactly the right place for him to lick the length of her pussy before plunging in where he knew he would get her off. And it worked. Lauryn grabbed the back of her colleague's head pressing him hard to finish her off.<br><br>Michael smiled warmly as she released him after she had come back down. "I almost regret leaving after that," she joked.<br><br>"Stay," Michael suggested. They both smiled as Lauryn got off Michael's desk and stepped around to the one she used to work at. She sat down there, in her chair as she had so many days before going nude. She stared at Michael for a moment, she stared at her desk, she stared around the room. Then she got up and went to the exit, to the staircase and back down the stairs.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The mezzanine was winding down for the afternoon. Jackson looked up from her laptop where she had been doing some course reading on industrial relations and checked her app to make sure she had no calls. Checking the time, she looked over to Lauryn who was scrolling through something on her laptop, sitting close to the other mailgirl. Lauren, who had less than an hour remaining as a mailgirl.<br><br>"Are you feeling it yet?" Jackson asked her.<br><br>"I'm still naked," Lauryn smiled back. Clearly, the angst she had felt in the preceding weeks had gone. She was smiling, relaxed, waiting for it to end. "Did you see the email?" Jackson nodded. Lauryn looked like she was still surprised. "She actually did it," Lauryn told her friend, "God knows why but she is actually looking out for me. That speech she made at lunch. Maybe she actually meant it."<br><br>Jackson gave Lauryn a serious look. "You haven't yet told me yet. Where are you going to be working?"<br><br>Lauryn looked around for privacy. Presumably she did not want the others to know where to find her. Happy that they were alone, Lauryn leaned closer to her friend. "Famechon Engineering," she revealed. Jackson's visage immediately tightened. And Lauryn noticed. "Why? What's that look for?" she demanded.<br><br>Jackson thought for a moment. Then realised it was better to tell. "We're going to be running a mailgirls pilot over there." Lauryn was shocked into silence. Jackson continued. "Pam and Annette have been chosen to go over there for a stint to help them start it."<br><br>Lauryn managed to regain her voice. She was low, quiet, shocked. "You're fucking joking. How does that happen to me?" she asked.<br><br>"But you're going over there as a clothed business analyst. That's why they hired you." Lauryn shook her head. Jackson gave her a sympathetic look and continued. "I'm sure that Pam and Annette will treat you with complete discretion. You know them, they wouldn't want to upset you or make things difficult for you."<br><br>Lauryn shook her head. "My last day. I thought I was getting away from it."<br><br>Jackson tried to ease the tone. "But you are. In a short while, you will be putting your clothes back on and walking out of here for the last time."<br><br>Lauryn was not completely convinced. "I guess..." she started.<br><br>Jackson stood up. She came over to Lauryn and gestured for her to stand too. "Come on," she urged her friend who eventually obliged. Jackson grabbed her in a tight hug. "I won't get to do this anymore," she whispered into Lauryn's ear, "at least not in the office." Jackson held her fellow mailgirl tightly with one hand and let the other one trail down her friend's back.<br><br>They were stopped by a buzzing. Lauryn quickly realised that it was her app. She untangled herself from Jackson, checked the app and shook her head with a wry smile. "Yes," she told Jackson, "I have a call. Would you believe that it's Shane? Again."<br><br>Jackson could only laugh at that. "Do you want me to come with you?" she asked.<br><br>Lauryn rolled her eyes to the heavens. "Yeah," she agreed, "good idea. Why not?"<br><br>Jackson hugged her again and looked straight at her with real affection. "So nothing to worry about. Come on, enjoy your last day," she urged.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"Hi Shane," Lauryn sang out as she strode into his office, tall and proud. "You have a message for me?"<br><br>Shane was at least behind his desk this time, watching Lauryn as she poised close to his desk but just out of reach. "So glad you could make it here before you finish. No message." Lauryn stood in front of the deputy of the office, naked and smiling. Enticing. "Great to see that you're more relaxed than this morning," Shane continued. "Gives us a chance to say goodbye properly." He shuffled his chair back as if she had invited him to do something.<br><br>At that moment, Jackson strode into the office, walked right up to her taller friend. "Ah there you are," she smiled at the other naked mailgirl as she played her fingers across Lauryn's bicep all the time smiling at Shane who stopped his progress.<br><br>Shane was about to rise but plonked back down in his seat. "I wasn't expecting you," he told Jackson.<br><br>Lauryn's face was so close to the other mailgirl's. "He wanted to say goodbye properly," she stage whispered to Jackson who was now running her fingers along the outside of Lauryn's breast.<br><br>"Like this?" Jackson delivered back in the same way. She embraced the other mailgirl, propped up on her toes to meet her mouth to mouth for a passionate kiss.<br><br>"And like this," Lauryn agreed, as she pulled back from their kiss to lean down and gently nibble at Jackson's nipples. Jackson had her hand between Lauryn's legs. She turned to smile dangerously at Shane who stayed stranded behind his desk.<br><br>"What's in it for me?" Shane complained. The women stopped their explorations, both turned to face Shane. They held hands, almost chastely as they smiled widely at the boss.<br><br>"Memories," Lauryn answered as they held their grins. And they turned, still holding hands, and strode out of Shane's office.<br><br>The two mailgirls were still smiling at each other when they returned to the mezzanine. "I can't believe that we did that," Jackson tittered, so out of character for her. But somehow she felt free and happy for the experience.<br><br>Lauryn looked at her app. "I think that's a good note to end on. I'm about done here." Jackson pulled a disappointed face but Lauryn shrugged and went into the change room. Jackson looked around the open area of the mezzanine. Pam, Monika and Annette were in a deep discussion around a laptop screen. She looked over at Kimiko who was in her usual place, off in the corner. Except that she was on her back and had a spreader bar attached to her ankles with her legs up in the air, her crotch on display to anyone who chose to look over at her. 'What is she doing now?' Jackson wondered with some exasperation that her tormentor was again doing something new that none of the others had thought of.<br><br>Despite her angst Jackson felt attracted to study whatever Kimiko was doing and stepped closer to see exactly what she was up to. Which was where Jackson noticed that Kimiko was trying to reach down to get herself off. But due to the spreader she could not reach her pussy, at least that was how it seemed to Jackson. "Can I help you?" she asked the other mailgirl.<br><br>Kimiko looked vague as she nodded. "I guess so," she told Jackson with no feeling. Just acceptance that since Jackson was there she could solve her problem.<br><br>"Where did you get that, Kimiko?" Jackson asked as she ran a hand along the shiny metal rod.<br><br>"Oh the usual place," Kimiko replied like that was enough.<br><br>So Jackson knelt below the spreader, facing Kimiko's crotch. Without any further thought, she leant forwards to lick at Kimiko. She steadied herself against Kimiko's spread legs as she dived in, guessing correctly what would turn Kimiko on. Within her constraints Kimiko pushed against Jackson as she throbbed with pleasure. Jackson stopped for a moment and noticed that Kimiko had a bondage video on her laptop. She returned to her work on Kimiko realising that she was just an instrument in Kimiko's pleasure alongside the spreader and the visual stimulation. She licked a little lower down realising that was where Mitch entered Kimiko when they were making love. This, she told herself, was not making love. But still she felt a need to give Kimiko the pleasure that she craved. Was that wrong? Was it weird? Did it matter. She kept on with her tongue, knowing that she was doing a lot right as Kimiko came strongly.<br><br>She was still down there when Lauryn walked out of the showers, now in her clothes, drying her hair. Lauryn immediately saw what was going on in the corner. She walked over to where Jackson was still on her knees between Kimiko's legs. "Well," Lauryn stated, "that didn't take you long to get over me." Jackson looked up, defensive. But her friend did have a smile on her face.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Emily sauntered into Mitch's home study. She knew something was up. "Dad, you're acting funny. What's up?"<br><br>Kimiko had just messaged him. Mitch looked up at his daughter from where he had been working at his desk before the text. He would answer the mailgirl later. Mitch looked at his daughter with concern. "Someone in the media has footage of you protesting as a nude mailgirl," he told her.<br><br>Emily smiled, rocked her head to the side. "Oh that. That was ages ago. Am I in trouble?" She gave her father the impression that she clearly thought that she had done nothing wrong.<br><br>Mitch had that look on his face, the one that said he always tried to tell his daughters straight how things were. "Only if they actually work out that it was you. It's a reporter who has it. So they are after a story. And they have been asking around. They got hold of Shane because I guess they imagine that Harada is mailgirls central."<br><br>"Well it is," Emily pointed out.<br><br>Mitch ignored that for what he had decided to say next. "I suggest that you don't do any sort of mailgirl things for the next little while. You haven't been..." he faultered.<br><br>Emily played dumb. "What's the worst thing that could happen?" she asked.<br><br>Mitch thought about that for a moment. He knew he had to play the censorious parent. "You get charged with obscenity or something like that. This family gets a lot of press attention that could be, well, not pleasant. And then after that you won't get hired as a mailgirl by anyone because of the fuss about you. Especially if they link you to me. You know how the press are here."<br><br>"One day, mailgirls will be a normal part of office life," Emily argued. 'If only he knew about her performance in the play,' she reflected. And the rest...<br><br>Mitch shook his head. "I doubt it."<br><br>But Emily was not yet finished with her train of thought. "The office of the future. Our generation is a lot more relaxed about these things than you are."<br><br>Mitch smiled. "You may be right. But I don't think that is going to happen for a long time. From what's happened in the office I can tell you that there are a lot of issues that still need to be ironed out."<br><br>Emily looked away and smiled. "Like mailgirls sleeping with the special projects manager."<br><br>Mitch tried to claw back some dignity. "That is different," he tried. Maybe saying that was a mistake.<br><br>Emily felt that her father had talked himself out on the subject. It was time for her to drop her news. "Dad, I've got an internship."<br><br>Mitch tried to look as fatherly as he could, interested in his daughter's career. "Where is it?" he asked. "What will you be doing?"<br><br>Emily took a breath. Would her father know? "Famechon Engineering. I'll be interning." She carefully studied her father's face for any reaction that he might know what Shane had been up to. Nothing that she could see.<br><br>"Interning?" asked Mitch. "Do you know any of the specifics of what you will be doing? I'm only asking because I want what's best for you. I don't want you wasting your time filing and making coffee all day..."<br><br>"Dad, it's interning. I can quit whenever I want to. It's not like I owe them anything. And Uncle Shane said..."<br><br>That woke Mitch up. "What's Shane got to do with this?" Mitch sensed that he should be worried now that Shane was involved. What was he up to?<br><br>"Uncle Shane helped me to get it. And you trust him, don't you? Didn't he mention it to you?"<br><br>Mitch winced. The first thought of Shane that came to mind was Shane herding Mitch out of his own office so that he could have his way with June. He shook his head. "Shane said nothing to me about it. But I guess I should be grateful since it sounds like a step for you on the corporate ladder. No more of this thing about mailgirls." Something was not right about it, Mitch wondered. But he had said what he wanted to about mailgirls. Still something niggled him. Had he rambled on to his daughter too much? But still, Shane...<br><br>Emily was looking strangely at Mitch. Eventually she had to speak up. "You don't know about Famechon Engineering?" she asked.<br><br>What was she on about, Mitch wondered. Then he clicked. 'Oh fuck,' he thought but he knew his face had given him away.<br><br>"Don't worry Dad, it will all be all right," Emily concluded. "It's only an internship." She pecked her father on the cheek in thanks for his silent understanding and left. Mitch shook his head in defeat.<br><br>Jessica went into the study straight after Emily had finished. "So how did the talking to go?" she asked her husband eagerly.<br><br>Mitch seized on his wife's energy levels. "You look different, enervated. What have you been up to?"<br><br>Jessica beamed. "I had lunch with Holly. It was very..." she looked for the right word before just using the one that Mitch had given her, "enervating."<br><br>Mitch was distracted by too many things swirling in his head all at the same time. "That would explain it," he told his wife without thinking on it at all. But no, he would not tell her yet about Emily. Why bring the mood down?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson reclined on her chair, facing Belinda who sat across from her at the small meeting table in her office. They had done the small talk. "Good to have you in here, we haven't talked for a while," Belinda noted resting her elbows on some paperwork on the table. "How have things been?" she asked the bare mailgirl. Meaning the job.<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "Normal." Well, what was she going to say otherwise?<br><br>Belinda tried to keep the atmosphere light. "I hate to think what that could mean around here," she wondered, rolling her eyes for a hopeful comic effect. Jackson relented a little and smiled back at the Head of HR. Belinda was fine with that. She did not need to know everything. She probably did not want to know anything now she thought a little deeper. But still. She decided to ask. "I don't quite get the mailgirl thing," Belinda admitted. "Sometimes I'd like to get inside your heads."<br><br>"It's easy," Jackson responded. "You come to work, take off your clothes, deliver messages when you're required, and at the end of the day you put them back on..."<br><br>Belinda shook her head. "I never thought I would ever hear you say something like that," she replied. "A little brusque, don't you think? Are you becoming comfortable here? Or cynical?"<br><br>Jackson was taken aback. She sat up straight against that assertion. "I don't know about that!" she fired back.<br><br>But Belinda just smiled at Jackson's overreaction. "Or is there something that you are not telling me, that you don't want me to know?" She got no response from the mailgirl, so she tried another tack. "We could make you a permanent employee. All you would have to do is say 'yes' and I'd make it happen." She realised that the naked woman sitting opposite her was blushing down past her neck, flustered. There was not much that a mailgirl could hide if you asked them the right question and watched for a reaction.<br><br>"I don't know," Jackson stammered. What is wrong with some certainty, she wondered. All she had to do was say yes, and she would have this relatively stress-free job as long as she liked. Instead of going through the whole performance of Lindsay signing her contract extensions. A nice job with nice people. What was wrong with that? But Mitch and Kimiko... She sat still but looked away from Belinda while she processed her conflicting thoughts.<br><br>Belinda waited. "Oh well," she shrugged, correctly assuming that subject was closed, at least for the time being. "When you're ready." Belinda decided to move on and opened the folder in front of her on the table. "I've looked into Jeneva," she started to explain as she flicked through the documents in the file. "You were right of course. Jeneva would be on the same pay and conditions if she came over here. Which is a change from what she has in the States."<br><br>"And what if she goes back?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"The lawyers say that the jurisdiction of the EA — in relation to her only — extends only as far as Australia's borders. Because she agreed to the American conditions and pay when she was first hired there she would go back to that when she returned. Unlike Heather who legally is still an Australian employee. Which is why Heather is the highest paid mailgirl over there give or take the exchange rate."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Not to mention the revenue she brings in for the merch and whatever they charged for her tour."<br><br>"Her what?"<br><br>"She did a ten city tour last month. And it's not the first one that she's done."<br><br>The first Belinda had heard of this. "What happens?"<br><br>"In the morning she gets delivered to the lucky office by limo. It drops her outside the office so she gets to wander outside in uniform of course to draw an audience before going in to be a mailgirl there for the day."<br><br>Belinda shook her head in amazement. "At least that doesn't happen here," she stated. They both thought 'yet' but did not say it. "Now," Belinda pivoted, "let's talk about you. Jackson, you need to take holidays. Do you even know what you've got banked up? You could take four weeks now. I think it would do you good."<br><br>Jackson leaned back and stretched. "What if I said this was my holiday?"<br><br>Belinda shook her head with amusement. "I'd say you were an idiot. You, of all people, know there's a good reason why everyone should take holidays."<br><br>Jackson smiled back. "Hear me out." She explained that compared with what she did for work before — "but I'm sure you know this Belinda — being a mailgirl is a hoot. I enjoy coming in. I have a social life in the office and no pressure..."<br><br>"This is the modern work world. Work-life balance. What about your social life outside?" Belinda tried.<br><br>Jackson smirked. "You wouldn't want to know. But a day of this sets me up for late nights and a lot of fun. Believe me, every day is like a party."<br><br>Belinda shrugged. "Of course you think you have all the answers."<br><br>Jackson sat up straight. "What?" Belinda had never spoken to her like that.<br><br>Belinda remained calm. "Maybe I'm seeing it from a different perspective to you."<br><br>Jackson smiled dangerously. "You're missing some of the benefits of the job." She pinched both her nipples, tugged them towards Belinda while rubbing them between her fingers to get the quickest sensations. Belinda said nothing as she watched the mailgirl pleasuring herself, her nipples now prominently hard.<br><br>Jackson smiled straight at the HR manager as she kept on, now massaging, rubbing each breast. "Have you ever thought about it?" she swooned. "Of course you have. I don't want to scare you. But you know the mailgirl rules. If I wanted you to, ah, help me out..."<br><br>Belinda stared straight into Jackson's eyes. "I know the rules. Yes, I would be obliged to help you." And experienced some new confused feelings.<br><br>"Yet none of the mailgirls have asked you to help them." Jackson spread her legs, hinting at what would happen next.<br><br>"How do you know that?" Belinda snapped back.<br><br>"Well, have they?" Jackson challenged. She might be on the edge while engaging the other woman...<br><br>Belinda tried to look matter-of-fact about it. "I guess they all have their favourites. Not me. Monika has Stuart whether he likes it or not. I assume that Shane being Shane would be in some demand. And..." she halted for a moment, "...I assume that you have Mitch when you need a hand."<br><br>Jackson thought for a moment. She pinched her nipples again, keeping them hard, but also finding that she liked showing off in front of this more senior woman who was clearly having some issues about it. "Mitch," Jackson stammered, her chest heaving, "has helped... on occasion..." That hung in the air between the two women, so Jackson felt obliged to continue. "But he has a wife... So he only helps so far..."<br><br>Belinda smiled. "That sounds like Mitch."<br><br>Jackson took a deep breath, her skin flushed, as her urges took over. "Do you want to know what he does?" She did not let the HR manager respond. Instead she stood up and slinked around to Belinda's side of the table, took the Jeneva file and placed it on her now vacated seat then wedged herself onto the table sitting facing Belinda with her legs spread so close to Belinda. Who just stared at her, first her face, then lower down.<br><br>Certain that she was in control, Jackson took one of Belinda's hands and placed it gently just above her pussy to allow Belinda the choice to move her hand down. She did rest it there for a moment then lowered her fingers to Jackson's slit. She looked to Jackson for confirmation. The mailgirl smiled and licked her lips in appreciation. 'I haven't even started,' Belinda thought. She let one finger stray deeper into Jackson. "You're very wet!" she exclaimed.<br><br>"What did you expect?" Jackson groaned. She pushed her hips forward, urgent for stronger contact. Belinda obliged with another finger, both going deeper. "That's good," Jackson urged, "but Mitch... uses... his... tongue..."<br><br>Belinda's face was so close to Jackson's crotch since she was knuckles deep in the other woman. "I couldn't..." she started automatically. But she stared at what she was doing to the mailgirl down there. And as something clicked, she decided 'why not?' Belinda leant forward to place her tongue gently on Jackson's clit. She might as well go directly for gold since the mailgirl was already well buzzed.<br><br>"Harder!" Jackson demanded gripping the table as a pleasure wave washed over her. Belinda obliged, gently scraped a tooth over Jackson's most sensitive area and then went all in, lapping then forcing her mouth hard, realising that she was enjoying the mailgirl's fulfilment maybe as much as Jackson. The mailgirl suddenly came in a strong convulsion. Belinda had the nous not to let up her pressure until Jackson was sated enough to push the HR Head away.<br><br>Belinda sat back up. "I... I... don't know..."<br><br>Jackson was in greater control. "You didn't know that you could do that? Let me be honest, you were very good." She got up and walked back around the table, put the file back in front of Belinda and sat down just as she had when their meeting had started. Now in control of herself, Jackson smiled a little wickedly across the table. "You know the conditions that we have as mailgirls. You must have expected that it would happen some time. You must have thought about it."<br><br>Belinda stayed silent, decided to keep some mystery from Jackson about her current feelings, her private desires, her deepest thoughts.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>"Why do we have to keep meeting like this?" Shane complained.<br><br>"Look at the puppies," Rosemary Millwall cooed, "aren't they adorable?" She was actually poking a finger between the bars of the pet shop's puppy cage letting the closest ball of fluff lick it.<br><br>Shane remained unimpressed. "I've seen puppies," he sniffed.<br><br>"And aren't they adorable?" Rosemary taunted him as she stepped back from the cage and thrust her chest at him. Then she played at being the winsome girlfriend again. "Oh, won't you buy me one of those cute fluffy things?" she cooed. The staff in the shop had the nous to stay well away from this overdramatic couple. The two who weren't behind the counter at the front of the store pretended to tidy things up. While staying in hearing range. Well, entertainment was entertainment.<br><br>Shane straightened up. "Why do we have to keep meeting like this?" he repeated quietly knowing that there were eavesdroppers.<br><br>Rosemary stepped right up to him. They were all but embracing. "Because this needs to be discussed discretely where we can't be overheard."<br><br>"I wonder if they sell vultures here," Shane wondered, regaining his space from Rosemary by taking a step back. "I think that would suit you."<br><br>Rosemary pretended not care about that slight. "Okay, let's have a look at the birds then!" she enunciated dramatically. And led Shane away from the nosy staff over to the birdcages.<br><br>"Explain," Shane demanded knowing that they were now in private.<br><br>"I need to go back," Rosemary admitted. Shane looked at her. "I'm working an angle and I need more than I've got."<br><br>"Are you sure it's not because you like walking naked around an office and you want more of that?" Shane smiled.<br><br>"I'm a professional," Rosemary warned.<br><br>Shane rolled his eyes. "So what's the angle?"<br><br>"I need to go deeper into the dynamics of the office psychology, to see how this is working as a social experiment."<br><br>"Whew, I thought you were going to say that you needed more time to win over the mailgirls' trust," Shane stated.<br><br>"Well, that would be nice too," Rosemary agreed.<br><br>"But that's not going to happen," Shane stated flatly. "They don't like you."<br><br>Rosemary gave Shane a reaction like that triviality did not matter to her. Likely, it really did not matter what with the story being more important than anyone's feelings. "How about the researcher, Fanny?" she asked to show that she was trying some new angles.<br><br>Shane nodded. "She will talk to anyone about her research." He gave the reporter a non-committal look. "I'll see what I can do," he added, offhand.<br><br>Rosemary sidled up to him. "Will this help?" she asked as she quickly looked around then dropped to her knees. Shane looked around as Rosemary unzipped him and released his cock. The caged birds may be watching them but otherwise they seemed to have some privacy. It was moot if they didn't. Rosemary quickly had Shane hard and almost as quickly he came in her mouth.<br><br>Shane was not surprised when Rosemary almost immediately stood up. Except for wiping her lips with the back of her hand, she acted like nothing had happened.<br><br>"You did not have to do that," Shane told her softly, almost gently. Rosemary looked at him as if she had no idea what he meant. So he continued. "No, I actually meant that you did not have to do it. I would have organised things for you anyway." Rosemary still stared at him as if she had no idea about what he was saying. Shane continued. "I'm in no doubt that Lindsay would be more than happy to see you there again. She wants more publicity for the program and she thinks you are the best way to do that."<br><br>Rosemary nodded at that. "So Wednesday," she stated. And she left, walking quickly like she had to rush for her next meeting.<br><br>Shane wandered back up the aisle, slowly ambling towards the entrance looking nonchalant, like that sort of thing happened all the time.<br><br>One of the sales staff stood up as he was about to squeeze past her. She smiled as her eyes twinkled, staring straight into his. "Well done, man," she gushed. "Something about those birds turns the women on."<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about," Shane scoffed.<br><br>The saleswoman shook her head. "We call that part of the shop 'the Head quarters.' Happens there all the time. Maybe the birds are giving off pheromones or something. Who knows? But yours was all rather quick. Feel up for another one?" She reached for Shane's crotch.<br><br>Surprised, Shane backed away from her. "I'm a married man with two children!" he complained.<br><br>The saleswoman cackled. "That's what they all say," she called at Shane as he quickly escaped from the shop. About four steps out of the entrance Shane stopped and wondered about turning around to accept the invitation. After all, why not? Why did he run? He did think about it for a short instant. But he decided the moment had probably passed, so he continued out to the street.<br><br>And soon he was worrying about the details of getting Rosemary back into the office. Who, for a start, did he have to schmooze to ensure that it would happen as smoothly as possible? Sure Lindsay would be all up for it. But the mailgirls? Gah, he decided, I better get Jackson onside this time. He gritted his teeth, he would have to deal with her directly for a change. Oh well.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>On the first morning after her departure, Jackson already missed Lauryn, the friend she vented to, knowing that she could tell her anything when she had to let off some steam. Or just have a gripe. She found herself alone in the showers with Annette. Ever observant, Annette asked her what was up.<br><br>"June," Jackson admitted. "She stripped off and joined us about five minutes ago and she's already fucked Shane."<br><br>"Go girl," Annette gushed. Then she noticed that Jackson did not appear happy with the events that she had outlined. "Tell me," Annette empathised. So Jackson told her the whole story. All the time Jackson was berating herself. Five minutes and she's already fucking on the job. How long have I been doing this without letting anyone even once. Blocking Bryce. What's wrong with me?<br><br>"Would you take some advice from silly old me?" Annette asked carefully.<br><br>"Annette," Jackson shot back, "I admire you. Don't you dare think that I am in any way superior to you."<br><br>Annette looked a bit happier. But she still felt that she had to explain herself. "You know tons about stuff that I know absolutely nothing about. Like our work conditions and all that stuff. I'd totally understand if you didn't want to hear stuff from me."<br><br>Jackson reached over to gently hold Annette's wrist while she looked in her eyes. "Don't you ever think that. And come on, if you've heard anything about me — outside of my speciality, all that stuff you mentioned — you would know that for a start my sex life is a fuck-up."<br><br>Annette thought about that for a moment. "Looking in the wrong places? Your standards are too high?"<br><br>Jackson sighed. "All of that and more."<br><br>Annette straightened up. "I don't believe it. I thought you were the most sorted out mailgirl here. I'll tell you what. We're going to make some time together to sort of all of this out. You're going to tell me everything. But..." she looked a bit harried... "we've got to get a move on. Otherwise we're going to be late for inspection."<br><br>The two of them quickly towelled off and headed out of the showers to the public area of the mezzanine. And stopped as they were about step into the open, surprised at what they saw.<br><br>Lindsay and Stuart were standing next to Wendy who was talking to the mailgirls who were already in line. Lindsay wore a serious look. The bonhomie of the lunch had clearly gone. Annette looked to Jackson, concerned. Jackson grinned back. "Be casual and laid back. Show them that you're not concerned about them being here. If you don't let them get to you, it will be fine."<br><br>Annette poked Jackson in the side. "And you wonder why I look up to you," she muttered.<br><br>Jackson wandered in the direction of the inspection as Annette followed her. Jackson suddenly swerved away from the group and planted herself in one of the display chairs which was facing the group. Annette stopped, stood back to see how things would play.<br><br>Jackson was staring straight at Lindsay. "Things are getting a bit lax here," Lindsay told her, realising that she had no option but to stare straight at Jackson's open crotch, a function of the display chair. Having to face the usually officious mailgirl spreading herself like that, Lindsay failed to exert her usual domination persona. Instead she sounded a bit peevish. And she knew it.<br><br>Jackson knew it too. "What exactly is getting lax?" she enquired with an edge suggesting she knew she was in control. She even — apparently absently — ran a hand down her chest, to the top of her neatly trimmed bush. She twirled a lock of it around her finger. Surprised that it was long enough to do that. Maybe that was what was lax? Jackson held that stare at Lindsay daring her for an answer that would almost certainly breach their work conditions.<br><br>Both management and mailgirls would only realise later that the stand-off between Jackson and Lindsay was the end of Lindsay's attempts at doing the inspection. It was Wendy who realised it at that moment. She slunk back away from the group as she expected that her presence up front would remind everyone of the daily inspection routine and the fact that they had not done it yet.<br><br>Monika decided to fill the void and ask Lindsay a question. "Do you really want to give us numbers?" she asked. "That's what I heard." She stared at Stuart.<br><br>Lindsay stared hard at the perky mailgirl. "You know it is the norm elsewhere. And the mailgirls there don't mind it. But we all know the rules here, so that's just not going to happen."<br><br>'Whether or not you want it,' Monika thought privately. She was not the only one to note that Lindsay did not quite answer the question.<br><br>"What about this new local mailgirl program we're helping. Will they use numbers?" Jan asked.<br><br>"That's up to them," Lindsay shot back. It was like a press conference where the interviewee did not want to say anything.<br><br>Jackson still sprawled in the display chair spoke up to that however. "They are looking at our EA," she reported. "We are pushing the argument that only something very close to our conditions is likely to be approved by the Fair Work Commission. They are very much concerned with giving nude office workers all the protections they can."<br><br>Stuart shook his head and grunted. Jackson noticed that along with most of those present. Jackson stared at him. "No, they're not being woke Stuart," she chided. "They are actually protecting the company, well maybe soon the companies, so that they don't get themselves sued or worse because of something that happened to one of their mailgirls, one of us."<br><br>Annette spoke up. "Yeah, talking about our conditions, Lindsay, when are we going to get our bonus points back?"<br><br>Lindsay shook her head. "If you were concentrating during the staff finance presentation..." Monika groaned with memories of that episode. "Exactly," Lindsay smiled, her lips upturned, "you would have noted that the rest of the office is doing it tough. No replacement staff, no pay rises, we're even finding it hard to get new equipment. Whereas due to someone's excellent negotiation skills..." She looked to Jackson who smiled warmly back, incongruously and knowing it. "Due to Jackson's negotiating skills," Lindsay continued, "you may have noticed that you all recently got a five percent increase on top of your already generous salaries..." She looked around the room to see how that sat.<br><br>"But," Annette continued, "it's about the intrinsic rewards, not just the money. We like to feel rewarded for a job well done just like everyone else. It helps morale."<br><br>Stuart could not control himself. "Did you hear Lindsay? You are already overpaid for doing what? Sitting around on your bare butts doing nothing. And then getting the occasional request to walk up some steps and find someone..."<br><br>Monika had made her way over to her man and stopped him by pressing herself against him, putting a soothing arm around him. She had done this before and he knew what was coming next.<br><br>"Mailgirl!" he blustered, "you're not going to do this again!"<br><br>Monika stopped and looked to Jackson. Jackson looked to Lindsay. Lindsay caught Jackson's stare and looked over to Stuart as Monika trilled her fingers on his shoulder.<br><br>Lindsay knew the score. She needed to stop it right there. "Stuart," she said sternly. He looked at her, rebellious. She read that correctly. "I don't want to have to give you a warning." She really did not want to tell him that, but she knew that she had no choice.<br><br>Stuart snorted. But he had an air of resignation to his fate. Monika could feel that. She let go of Stuart's arms, smiled at him and then shimmied down until she was on her knees in front of Stuart. Too shocked and cowed to respond, before he could process, Monika had the difficult boss's pant open, exposing his cock. From there it was an instant before he was in her mouth.<br><br>Lindsay shook her head in amazement at the brazen scene in front of her. She looked to the other mailgirls, most of whom acted like it was no big deal. Jackson watched the scene closely like it was a nature documentary, which in a way it was. And Annette beamed widely and clapped her hands in approval.<br><br>Monika made clear that she wanted Stuart to cum pretty quickly. She bobbed dramatically up and down on him, you could almost see her working her tongue around him as he got hard and harder. And having surrendered to what she chose to do with him, Stuart was — maybe not so reluctantly — starting to show his enjoyment. The others stared.<br><br>Tentatively Stuart placed his hands on the back of Monika's head. He was careful to be gentle with her, at least with his hands. But that purchase of balance meant that he was able to thrust into her mouth which he was doing with greater and greater excitement, squeezing his eyes closed. This was clearly one of the headjobs of his life. Monika sensed what was coming as she moved so that her lips were around the head of Stuart's cock as he came in her mouth. He looked concerned for a moment but then looked down to see Monika happily swallowing as he thrust and came. When he was finally done, Monika stood up with a triumphant smile on her face. She kissed him, deep on the lips, and he did not flinch, taking her actions with only a hint of resignation to his fate.<br><br>Monika sensed his confusion as she hugged him closer and kissed him just below the ear. "What did you say?" she demanded, noting his lips moving. She stood there facing the boss, smiling with control. "I couldn't hear you."<br><br>Stuart looked somewhat dejected. "Thank you," he told her eventually. And he buttoned his pants and hastily left the room. Monika stayed where she was and shrugged.<br><br>Lindsay tried to be the boss, but carefully. "well, that was umm..." She thought for a moment. To no one in particular she offered "he'll be all right." The mailgirls stared at her. She realised that she should lead. "Do you have any more questions?" She knew that invitation was a mistake as soon as she asked.<br><br>Pam of all people spoke up first. "Do you have any more plans to change things?" she asked. And Lindsay could see that the mailgirls were not going to let her escape with a glib, management speak answer. She gave herself a mental kick for getting in that position. And their questions had to be answered.<br><br>`

                    subtitle: "Who wants to be an Aussie mailgirl?", 
                    content: `Heather McKay sprawled across the back seat of the limo. She smiled at the other two naked women in there, facing her. They were both sitting up, swigging glasses of champagne, emptying another bottle. One turned to the other. "Do you know where we're going?" she asked.<br><br>The tall blonde holding her glass shrugged over at the other tall blonde who sipped at hers. "I think they said Scranton."<br><br>Heather perked up. "Scranton?" she asked excitedly. "Like in 'The Office'?"<br><br>The tall blonde mailgirl who knew where they were going gave Heather a sympathetic look. "There's a reason they picked Scranton," she sneered.<br><br>But Heather now radiated her innate positivity. "It's The Office Scranton," she insisted, "I've seen it on TV, it's going to be fun!" The other two mailgirls scowled at her. But she took their reticence in her happy stride. "You two! We're going to enjoy this. Just follow my lead. Don't worry" she gushed. "If we have to, we'll make our own fun."<br><br>The silent one took a sip of her champagne, turned her nose up at its apparent bitterness and spoke up. "I guess you're not going to give up," she complained.<br><br>"No way!" Heather, now fully into her bright-eyed Aussie optimism.<br><br>The one who did all the talking dropped her shoulders in defeat. "I guess, you are going to tell us that you know to," she murmured. "How did you end up here anyway?"<br><br>"I wanted to see the States," Heather enthused. "And here we are, it's great!"<br><br>"I wish..." the silent one murmured, that was all she said.<br><br>Heather chose to ignore her tone. "Too right!" she rang out. And she ran her hands down to her crotch. "Let's have a wank off right now!" she announced. "Loser has to go down on the other two."<br><br>"What sort of competition is that?" the talking one complained. But then she realised that her silent compatriot and the effervescent Australian had already started. So she downed her champers and joined in. Sort of like what else could they do to shut the Energizer bunny up.<br><br>Heather toyed with her lower lips just away from her clit, just to get herself started, then smiled at the other two stopping what she was doing, with her fingers still just inside, to look seriously at them. "Where are my manners?" she realised. "I'm Heather, I'm from Australia. Look at us here, naked, wanking and we weren't even introduced."<br><br>The busty blonde spoke up first, continuing to massage a finger into her slit, her legs only slightly apart, like she was protecting some aspect of her modesty despite having no clothing to hide any of herself. "I'm Ashley Madison," she provided like she was answering on a form. Still she was getting a little damp. "I know," she added. But she even smiled, just a bit. What she was doing to herself was, she realised, nice.<br><br>The other mailgirl had started to go to work on herself. Having rested her empty glass in a convenient holder, she went with both hands working her clit and inside at the same time going deeper and deeper, like it was important that she cum quickly and win. Heather looked at her, smiling, waiting, still holding off from her own pleasure until they were introduced.<br><br>"Oh," the other mailgirl realised, "I'm Tanya Harding. Pleased to meet you, Heather. I know who you are and I'm impressed." She looked over at Ashley who having done her minimum social duty was now concentrating on herself. She was poking around like she was having trouble getting started. Tanya noticed and shook her head. "Don't worry about her," Tanya smiled at Heather. "She'll be licking us both out before you know it." That seemed very likely.<br><br>"Nice to eat you," Heather rejoined. And then went to town on herself, soon bucking in her place and gasping along with Tanya in ways that suggested the more restrained Ashley Madison would indeed be the one of them most likely to eat the other two out. Judging by the way that she was eyeing the other two and the slow, gentle way that she was pleasuring herself now that she had got started and found her places, she seemed to have decided that she was happy to do them. In fact, she leaned over to unexpectedly tongue Tanya's nipple, caressing her as she did so in a way that pushed the other American mailgirl over the edge. She looked over to the bucking Australian who now had both hands buried deep in her pussy, she was so close.<br><br>Ashley licked her lips as she watched Heather. "One to go," she smiled. Heather suddenly let out a long moan as she came.<br><br>All three of the mailgirls were somewhat flushed when they got out of the limo once they had arrived at the office that had won the competition. Each week, a mailgirl from Harada Industries went onto Good Morning America for a brief moment — blink and you would miss seeing a naked mailgirl on your breakfast television, she would be on just long enough to announce which lucky company would get a visit from Harada mailgirls the next week. The mailgirls suspected that the winners were selected on commercial decisions, whether they would be likely to introduce their own mailgirl program. Which would mean licensing fees to Harada and paying for Harada's training courses. It seemed everyone wanted mailgirls.<br><br>As usual, a crowd was waiting outside the lucky company when the limo pulled up. Somehow folk always knew when they would be arriving. "Who would have thought this many people would turn up to look at three naked women?" Heather joked. The other two did not find it funny. Tall and shapely, they would have been professionally distressed if that many people had not shown up to see them naked. They looked at Heather but could not work out whether she really meant it. They both felt that at least they would look professional. Let the Aussie do whatever she wanted.<br><br>Of course the mailgirls only appeared outside for as long as it took for them to wave to the well restrained crowd then walk the short distance into the building. Heather strolled between the two taller blondes who both performed a runway walk. They thought they were shielding her, giving the audience a glimpse of their dream of a perfect woman. Heather knew that Ashley and Tanya were her sidekicks, that perfect or not, she was the main attraction. So long as she kept it natural.<br><br>Security were waiting for them at the entrance along with a smiling and very toothy and excited woman who introduced herself as Bette Davis from Marketing who would be their guide for the day. One of the security guards handed them their visitor lanyards. The mailgirls handed them straight over to their guide. None of that pesky stuff for them. Bette Davis grasped the lanyards in her fist and led the mailgirls to a waiting lift, telling them breathlessly that they had about half an hour to freshen up or 'whatever they needed to do' before the all-staff meeting was due to begin in the auditorium.<br><br>"Whatever we need to do!" Heather exclaimed as she playfully punched Ashley on the shoulder. Ashley was not amused.<br><br>In the lift, Bette Davis continued to rapidly tell them all about the company, apparently with some pride. She rattled off how she thought the day would play out. The blondes were checking their reflections in the metal walls of the lift while Heather pretended to listen to her. Heather realised that Bette was trying to address her from the neck up. She smiled, knowing that this usually happened. So she slowly raised her hands to play with her breasts, just enough to draw Bette Davis' attention that little lower, to where the abandonment began. Out of the lift, Bette, a little flushed, led the mailgirls to their room.<br><br>"I'll leave you to it," Bette hurriedly told them.<br><br>This time Ashley got into Heather's act. She spread her arms wide and opened a leg to give Bette a full view. "Don't you have to stay and keep an eye on us?" Ashley teased.<br><br>"I... um..." was as much as Bette said before she backed out the door to close the three naked women in.<br><br>"Come on girls, fun!" Heather reminded the other two when they were alone. Tanya grudgingly smiled. Ashley nodded, happy with her little disruption.<br><br>Soon enough Bette returned, carefully knocked on their door. She then led the mailgirls to the company's auditorium and trying to maintain her dignity, directed them up to the front of the crowded room to the cautious applause of the assembled employees. It was always that way. The staff got a bit nervous faced with actual naked mailgirls rather than the distant strangers that they had seen on their screens.<br><br>Heather knew what to do to get things started the right way. She grabbed the microphone from the hovering Bette Davis and gave the assembly a toothy grin. "G'day cobbers, how they hanging?" she started. And as ever that broke the ice, got a wave of laughter throughout the crowd. Someone in the crowd called out 'you call that a knife?' to which Heather responded with "you need to throw another prawn on the barbie". And they were off like that for another few moments. Heather was impressed when someone shouted 'where the bloody hell are you?' at her. Madison and Tanya looked appropriately confused.<br><br>Eventually Heather got to deliver her spiel about why they were visiting, how lucky the company was, which rules to follow so that everyone could have a good time. Then she gave the room a serious look. "I believe this office needs five mailgirls," she recited as if it was writ. That led to a buzz of anticipation. Two women stepped forward, shedding their dresses as they reached the front of the room. They were both in on it, otherwise they may have had something on under their dresses. Now nude they approached the Harada mailgirls and the blondes each gave them a very close hug. Both the locals got flustered at that. And the blondes gave each other knowing looks. All part of the service.<br><br>The visiting blondes played to look after the local soon-to-be mailgirls, keeping them to the front of the stage, in clear view of everyone. Ashley and Tanya each took their trainee in hand, raised that hand above their head and twirled them around to show all of the volunteers' bodies off to their colleagues. More kisses, a finger or two near their nipples. And the assembly gave the two — now braver — naked women a concerted round of applause, clapping and calling.<br><br>Heather waited for the support to quieten down while the two newbies who were now clearly into the scene, posed for the audience. "Anyone else?" Heather teased the group. She looked straight at Bette Davis who blushed bright red.<br><br>"Not me!" she gasped. Heather smiled warmly at her, diffusing. She had long ago worked out that there was no point in coercion. "Anyone?" Heather laughed, like it did not matter to her whether there were any further volunteers or not. Hoping that some exuberant man did not offer himself and risked ruining the moment and the experience for everyone whether it mattered to him or not.<br><br>But then there was a rustle near the front of the audience. A woman stepped forward. Seeing a possibility Heather clapped her hands generously at the somewhat uncertain woman. Having taken a courageous first step, she now wavered, wondering if it was such a good idea. "Come on," Heather called out to her, "you little beauty." She could lay it on thick, nothing she would ever say at home.<br><br>"You're so brave," the uncertain woman stammered as she took another careful step towards Heather.<br><br>"What's your name?" Heather asked warmly, now literally reaching out to her.<br><br>The woman looked down at her feet. "Ginger," she stated flatly.<br><br>Heather clapped her hands in delight. "That should have been my name!" she gushed. Heather even pointed down at her neatly trimmed pubis. "Look see!" she announced. It was true. Her pubic hair was undoubtedly a shade of red. Ginger let Heather take her by the hand to lead into a world of exploration.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson having delivered a message to the engineers on the eleventh floor of Harada's Melbourne office was taking her time going back down the stairs to the mezzanine. Of course it would be Kimiko Date coming up the stairs towards her. Jackson chose to look defiant. Kimiko for once seemed a little nervous. So you should be, Jackson thought. Was Kimiko sneaking up to see Mitch, she wondered.<br><br>But Kimiko took the chance and spoke first. "Thanks for the other day," she demurred.<br><br>"That's okay," Jackson started to reply automatically polite. Wait a minute, she thought. Kimiko might have been thanking Jackson for getting her off the other day, going down on her when she was restrained by the spreader. But what about the other times? Jackson realised that there had been plenty of other times. And had Kimiko ever been down between her legs? "And the other times," Jackson grumbled.<br><br>Kimiko looked confused. "We wanked each other off," she recalled. Kimiko reached out to the other mailgirl who took an impolite step back.<br><br>Jackson stared hard at Kimiko. "And to think that I wanked you off that time too."<br><br>Kimiko seemed upset at the rebuff. "I will never forget that. I never got the chance to reciprocate."<br><br>Jackson looked surprised. "Really, with everything else that you have done, got up to, I didn't think you would remember."<br><br>Kimiko shook her head gravely. "I remember everything. If there's anything you want me to do now..."<br><br>Jackson crossed her arms. "No, that's okay," she insisted. "But thanks anyway." She knew that she did not sound convincing.<br><br>Kimiko tried to give the other mailgirl an ingratiating smile. She was not sure that it worked as she stood a step down from Jackson, unsure of her intent. "There's something between us, some connection, I don't know what it is," she tried.<br><br>"Other than you stealing my office husband," Jackson retorted. There was clearly some hurt in that.<br><br>But Kimiko misjudged Jackson's feelings. "He's not your boyfriend, your office husband or anything," she chided. She was justified being superior about that. After all, Mitch was hers. He was fucking her not Jackson.<br><br>Jackson recoiled, even took a step back. "Well if that's your position, I don't know what there could possibly be between us. Nothing that I can see."<br><br>Kimiko grinned, unexpectedly animated. "Except for the times that you have had your face between my legs," she recalled. She convinced the other mailgirl that she really meant it.<br><br>Jackson tried but she could not avoid Kimiko's sudden warmth. Somehow Kimiko had infected Jackson with her look. Jackson could not but smile back at those memories. "Well that, I guess," she conceded.<br><br>Kimiko made it clear that she was looking down Jackson's exposed body. "By the way, nice bush," she smiled, "I like the way you've let it grow." Jackson could do nothing but wriggle her hips in response.<br><br>Kimiko stepped up and gently eased Jackson onto her back on the stairs, equally gently spreading the other mailgirl's legs. She looked up to give Jackson the rest of her smile and then lowered her face to Jackson's pussy. Jackson had to admit it was true, there was something that made them together.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jeneva, slim svelte and naked, shuddered as she stood in the foyer of Harada Industries' US office next to the equally naked if not quite as svelte Heather McKay. Who was now back at their head office. Jeneva clutched at the other mailgirl's arm. "Geez, you're cold," Heather exclaimed, "I thought you'd be used to this." She rubbed Jeneva's fingers rigorously as if that would help.<br><br>Jeneva shook her head, her eyes wide. "I was brought up in LA near the beach. I never even knew it could get this cold!"<br><br>"Well," laughed Heather as she gave up on the other mailgirl's hands to tweak both of Jeneva's rock-hard nipples, "you're first in line when he arrives, so it looks like you're going to make a good impression." She tweaked again. "It'll be an impression all right. If you pressed these up against him, you'll probably give him some bruises to remember you by." Heather looked down the line at the other mailgirls. They stood waiting either stoic or numb. In a line, so similar, tall, blonde, straight hair tied back in ponytails. Whoever had hired them clearly had a particular idea of an attractive woman. And then there was Heather, the short Australian with actual hips. And Jeneva. Slender sure but with pert breasts and long black hair.<br><br>Jeneva tried to twist out of Heather's grip. "How about you?" the American argued. "It never gets cold in Australia. So how do you put up with this weather?"<br><br>Heather shook her head. "You've only been reading the tourist stuff from Queensland, haven't you?" She gave the taller American a toothy smile, both hands on her hips, poised like she was waiting for her coffee or something.<br><br>Jeneva nodded seriously. "Perfect one day, something else the rest." Like the other American mailgirls she stood with one leg straight, one knee provocatively forward, one hand on hip. Jeneva was tense from the cold and from Heather playing with her. But she looked pleased with her antipodean knowledge.<br><br>Heather shook her head. "Google Melbourne winter," she suggested. But Jeneva shook her head with a giggle.<br><br>Of course at that moment, the limousine pulled up outside. Mr Harada's two immaculately black suited aides got out of the car and hurried around to the rear door, to attend to Mr Harada. Whispers raced through the mailgirls who straightened up to attention like some sort of nude guard of honour as Mr Harada was helped out of the car by his two straight-faced companions. Once out of the limo, Mr Harada waved his male aide away but was too happy to use the female as a crutch, reaching one arm over her shoulder to almost grip onto her well-covered breast. Like he had to in order to keep his balance, sure. She appeared not to mind.<br><br>Chrissy rushed up to Heather from inside panting from running down the stairs. She gave her girlfriend a quick peck as the boss of the whole company slowly approached them.<br><br>"Where have you been?" Heather asked her sotto voce, as Chrissy bustled up next to her, requiring Jeneva and then the other mailgirls to reorganise themselves into a slightly longer line.<br><br>"Delivery," Chrissy hissed back, "Mr Roberts wouldn't let me go." She turned slightly to show one reddish buttock to her girlfriend.<br><br>"Mr Roberts!" Heather exclaimed, shaking her head at the risks of being alone with him. She gave Chrissy's arm a little squeeze just before Mr Harada approached them.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>How had she and Mr Harada ended alone in this room together, Heather wondered. She stood there, staring at the boss, as he stood on the other side of the room, proud in his immaculate suit. While she was, of course, totally on display. He grunted at the bare mailgirl, made a gesture towards the couch against the wall near him. The gesture was unmistakable.<br><br>Heather tightened. "Are you going to ask me nicely?" Hands on her hips. So what if he could see everything. So what if he owned everything. So what if he paid her everything. It did not exempt him from having to behave. But the man stared back at the mailgirl, silent. "Honestly," she exclaimed.<br><br>Mr Harada swayed a little on the spot where he stood. "I expect certain things," he told her like it was always true.<br><br>Heather did not accept that at all. With one hand on her hip, she gestured back at the boss with the other. "That doesn't surprise me," she started friendly enough. Then a bit stronger. "But this is different, you are going to have to ask me. Nicely." And then Heather smiled widely like everything would be all right. Just make her happy, was the message.<br><br>Mr Harada stumbled over to the couch and sat there, all the time staring at Heather first a little threatening then reading her correctly, a little cautiously. He tapped his watch and looked over to the door. His female aide slid into the room, having only opened the door just wide enough to. Clearly she had been waiting right outside. But now inside she remained near the door, straight and silent as if she might prevent Heather from leaving. But from his seat, Mr Harada shouted rapidly in Japanese at his assistant.<br><br>Without reacting in any way to her boss's aggressive tone, the aide strode over to face the owner of the company, squat to her knees to open the man's pants then immediately took him in her mouth. In a short moment, Mr Harada pushed the aide's mouth away and looked over at Heather who stood at the other end of the room, arms crossed, watching the performance. He thrust his erection just the once in her direction.<br><br>"What do you think of it?" he carefully asked the mailgirl as his aide obligingly gave him a few strokes to keep him hard.<br><br>"Not unimpressive," Heather admitted.<br><br>"I think you could appreciate it better if you came closer," Mr Harada tried.<br><br>"Now why would I do that?" Heather smiled. She gestured at the assistant who was still in front of Mr Harada, on her knees. "Why don't you finish off with her?" Heather taunted, nodding towards the black suited woman who still held Mr Harada's cock like her duty was to keep him hard, once exposed.<br><br>Mr Harada smiled down at the assistant who pensively waited for what he wanted from her next. "She is quite submissive, in case you hadn't noticed," Mr Harada advised Heather, while now stroking his subordinate's neck. "But that's not my desire at the moment. Which is why I asked for you to be here. If, that is, you would like..." The man who owned the company let that hang between him and the naked mailgirl. But it was clear that he was trying to make an effort.<br><br>Heather sighed. She strode over to the exposed businessman and gripped one of his nipples hard through his shirt. 'Well, it worked for Jeneva,' she reasoned. Mr Harada responded by waving his assistant away. She let go of his cock and apparently reluctantly returned to her station by the door. Heather grabbed the man's cock more firmly than the other woman had.<br><br>"Well I guess you asked nicely," Heather smiled right into Mr Harada's face as she positioned herself on the man's cock. All she had to do was press her body down. "Or tried to," she strained as she tried to get him inside her.<br><br>"I haven't done this for a while," she told the man she had straddled, still working herself around him. Heather adjusted herself and let out a little groan as he went deeper. "So many things you don't have to worry about when you're a girl." She looked down at Mr Harada. "Are you comfy?" she asked him. The man did not respond. "Feels like you're all the way in." He grunted. "Well tell me if you're not happy," she decided. "I'm going to go for it!" And Heather bounced up and down on the man.<br><br>She stopped for a moment and looked at Mr Harada. "It's been a while," she repeated, "how am I supposed to do this again?" Heather smiled at the boss, but he stared blankly back at her. A look of mild disgust crossed his face, too quick for Heather to notice. Why, he wondered was he fucking this woman who was so unlike the mailgirls that he preferred, the Japanese ones who were so clean and submissive, the American ones so tall, beautiful and unapproachable. Except to him. Heads held high until he told them what to do.<br><br>Mr Harada became even more disgusted with himself, having to admit that the short, stocky and slightly pudgy Australian with her sun damaged face was indisputably turning him on. This was all manifested in his thrusting into her, first moderately then hard and fast. Yes, she had lit something in him. This was different. Better?<br><br>Heather sensed Mr Harada's immersion in the act and smiled right into his eyes. "You go for it, guy," she urged, "Now I'm juicy, I'll just stay like this and you can do all the work."<br><br>But Mr Harada barely acknowledged her urging as his own needs took over. Over-stimulated, his thrusting continued, but didn't go for much longer before the boss thrust one last time and held onto the mailgirl firmly as he came into her. Finished he slumped forward into her arms.<br><br>Heather held him against her chest for a moment before something concerned her. She lifted his face back from her embrace and could see nothing in him. "Are you alright?" she asked urgently. But he didn't respond. She looked over to the assistant near the door who appeared to be concentrating on nothing. "Hey you," Heather called out to her. "I think your boss needs some help."<br><br>The assistant did not seem to comprehend, so Heather moved a bit to let her see Mr Harada's blank face. So now the assistant showed a glimmer of concern and spoke softly into her wrist device. In a quick moment, the male assistant strode into the room. He looked at the assistant then looked over to Heather and the boss. He raced up to them and handled Heather off Mr Harada. It was then that she realised that he was still hard inside her. But now they were separated.<br><br>"You have to go now," the male assistant ordered.<br><br>"Did I kill him?" Heather asked.<br><br>But the only reply was a repeat of the previous order. "Go now!" with slightly more urgency. The female assistant came over, took Heather by the shoulders and gently walked her to the door and out of it. With the door firmly closed, Heather was alone in the corridor. Wow, she wondered. And then decided that she needed to be with Chrissy. What had just happened?<br><br><br><hr><br><br>At her workstation on the fourth floor at Famechon Engineering, Emily Johnson looked around the room at the other workers near her. They were all silently staring at their screens. Some were typing, some reading apparently. Emily looked at her screen again but could not get excited at what was on it. Apparently she needed to learn about the company's document management system so as to understand that any documents she created needed to be stored securely.<br><br>Emily quietly yawned. What, she wondered, could be more secure than a naked mailgirl carrying documents from one person to another? She scrolled through the presentation but there was no mention of that. 'What am I going to do all day?' she typed into her phone.<br><br>What was this work that they wanted her to learn? HR had said something to her, but she had not been listening. What could she do? Well, there was always the kitchen and the coffee maker. She looked over at the colleague who was meant to be training her, but she was busy flirting with a young guy standing close to her desk who was flirting back. Emily sighed, got up and went to the kitchen. A little miffed that Mr Flirt had not even noticed her. That would be different when she was a mailgirl. She worried for a moment. If she would ever become a mailgirl.<br><br>Emily was unsurprised that she soon had company at the coffee machine. She knew that a young, fresh and attractive woman would get some attention sooner or later. Two men, about her age, wandered up. One seemed to have social skills. The other blurted, asked her straight out if she knew how to use the coffee maker.<br><br>"I'm new," she smiled trying to be alluring, "will you show me?" She overemphasised her words and leaned forward to the poor guy, probably as close as he had been to a woman. Emily got the response she expected, he backed away.<br><br>"George will show you," the poor guy blurted out and escaped from the room as quickly as he could.<br><br>Emily smiled at George who was blatantly checking out her legs. Well, she had worn the short skirt on purpose. "I'm sorry about Bill," George started. "He's a bit nervous around women. I thought I'd help him break the ice." George clearly had none of Bill's reticence. He even stepped closer to Emily, repeating what she had done to the departed colleague, close enough to be exhaling on her.<br><br>"I hope we didn't deprive him of his coffee," Emily smiled without flinching, enjoying their intimacy.<br><br>George laughed. "Could you imagine him with some coffee in him? I guarantee he never touches the stuff." He gave Emily a soul look. "Not like us," he sleazed.<br><br>Emily stepped back. "You need to teach him to introduce himself before he blurts," she suggested.<br><br>"Noted," smiled George. It was unclear whether this would be implemented or whether Bill was mere collateral. "I'm George, I'm a trainee engineer here. One of the many. I guess that you are too?"<br><br>Emily gave her name. Then she chose to start to find out about the place. "Do you have women to deliver messages here?" she asked. George looked confused. Emily tried to clarify without revealing too much. "An inter-office service?" she tried.<br><br>But he still looked confused for a moment. Then he seemed to realise. "This is your first office job?" he asked. Emily nodded. Anything for info. "You've seen the videos," Shane continued. "That's in the States. We don't have that sort of thing here." He seemed sure of that, so Emily did not correct him. And now he had a big smile on his face. "What would you do if we did?" he challenged.<br><br>Emily laughed like she had made a real blooper. "What would you do?" she challenged back. Then they both laughed.<br><br>George said what she was thinking. "Could you imagine Bill?"<br><br>Emily laughed because she could not imagine Bill. Except that she could imagine stepping over to Bill's desk, completely naked watching him react to seeing her, all of her, and having to make eye contact and acknowledge her while she delivered a message to him. She realised that George was studying her, carefully checking her up and down, probably considering whether to invite her for an after-work drink or something. "Stupid me," she simpered, so out of character but what the Heck, "to think that every office had them."<br><br>"Pity," George agreed, "it would certainly liven this place up." He was, Emily could tell, imagining himself immersed in one of those videos with the American beach girls striding nude between the desks. She checked to see if George was eyeing her up and down, but he was careful not to get caught at that. He stared meaningfully into her eyes when she let him. Was George thinking of her in that role, she wondered. Which she found flattering if true. After all she knew she could pull it off. Since she had before, up on the stage. In the Uni ref... In Fanny's office. She looked at George sizing her up and wondered, well, did every young male hope that every young female could be a mailgirl?<br><br>But he was Mr Chivalrous. "Let me show you how the coffee machine works," he smiled, still that close to her. Well, at least she would learn something.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>At her desk Emily picked at her nails for a while before deciding that she had had enough. She found an empty meeting room so she could make a call. "Uncle Shane," she complained when he took the call, "no one here knows anything about a mailgirls program. Are you sure you sent me to the right place?"<br><br>Shane laughed. "You may have to do some work," he replied. "Are you learning anything?"<br><br>Emily wasn't taking that. "Is this the right place or not?" she demanded.<br><br>Shane checked through his notes. "Oh," he replied after a moment, "they're not due until Wednesday. We have two or three of ours going over to kick things off then. I guess that will be the big reveal, a pleasant surprise for the staff. I guess you'll just have to do some work for a few days. That could be good, you can pick up a few skills."<br><br>Emily pouted. "I thought you were quite happy with my skills."<br><br>Shane was up to that. "Yes well, you are very talented. But it helps to be able to do more than give good head. I thought that was the point of a university education."<br><br>Emily shook her head and sighed. "If only I had you here now. Right where I want you."<br><br>Shane laughed back at her. "Well, you are working for the competition. But who knows, I might find a pretext to drop over for a visit."<br><br>"Men," Emily complained and rang off.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Looking at Heather's expression on her screen, Jackson gave up trying to restrain herself and let it all out, a real deep laugh. Alone in Mitch's office, face-timing the other mailgirl she did not bother to muffle it. And Jackson found it hilarious, so why not? Eventually she stopped.<br><br>"It's not funny!" Heather insisted. "Honestly. I thought I'd killed him."<br><br>"Fucked him to death," Jackson chortled.<br><br>"It's a real thing," Heather argued. "How do you think Attila The Hun died?"<br><br>Jackson could not get the grin off her face. "Died in battle, I guess." Who knew anything about Attila The Hun?<br><br>Heather squeezed her legs together. "And it was the first fuck I've had in ages," she laughed. The memory. "Something a bit different to the girls." She gushed, just a little bit, at the memory.<br><br>Jackson pulled an admonishing face. "Not that you've been short of action with them," she chided.<br><br>Heather giggled. "Well, at least I remembered how to." They both laughed until Heather realised that perhaps Jackson did not find it actually that funny. Heather stopped laughing, tried to look deeply serious. "I thought I had killed him," she remembered.<br><br>"That must have been, um, something..." Jackson tried, feeling a little neglected. Who was there for her, she wondered.<br><br>Heather did not notice Jackson's chagrin. "You're telling me. One moment he's moving around inside me. Really going for it! And I'll admit that the old guy knew what he was doing. It was great, I was getting off, remembering what a good man could do to me. And then he kind of went limp on me." Heather gave Jackson a wide-eyed look. "But not in me. Still hard there, where it mattered. Hard there and limp in my arms. And of course suddenly it was bedlam. Suddenly I was being dragged off him and away and kicked out of the room. If I hadn't been so turned on I would have thought that I had been used."<br><br>Jackson mused. "It sounds like they were almost expecting it, like they all knew what to do. Do you think it had happened before?"<br><br>"No idea," Heather replied. "Like they were going to tell me anything. It was probably just a well-drilled first aider reaction."<br><br>"Yeah, you're probably right. Would make sense for them to be drilled in first aid. He doesn't seem the healthiest. And he's not young."<br><br>"Chrissy told me afterwards that he wants to have it away with all the mailgirls. He usually corners at least one every time he visits the States. Some sort of pride or ownership thing, she says."<br><br>"Yeah, I know," Jackson agreed.<br><br>Heather's eyes widened again. This time she noticed Jackson's expression. "Not you!" she exclaimed.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "We had an, um, encounter. But it didn't go anywhere."<br><br>Heather shook her head at her friend. "Girl, we've got to do something about you. I mean really. I might have to come back and sort you out."<br><br>"I'm sure that's not necessary."<br><br>Heather wagged a finger at her naked friend. "I think it's very necessary. And obviously no one over there is doing anything about it to help you. Tell me at least that you are still getting yourself off."<br><br>Jackson pretended to look shocked. "Of course I get myself off."<br><br>Heather nodded her appreciation of that. Then she looked serious. "Prove it!"<br><br>Jackson looked at her surprised. "I don't need to prove it to you. You know I do."<br><br>Heather shook her head. "No I don't," she deadpanned. Jackson did not pick up on her expression and did not give her a comeback. Heather stretched out, leaning back so she was visible on Jackson's screen down to her knees. "In that case," she told Jackson, "let's do it together."<br><br>Jackson sighed. Well, it made as much sense as anything else involved in being a mailgirl to have a mutual international wank with her colleague and friend, the one who had almost killed the owner of the company while fucking him. Following Heather's lead she pushed her own chair back and leant back in it too, also exposing herself over the VC. She laughed.<br><br>"What?" demanded Heather as she cupped a breast with one hand and pinched the nipple with the other.<br><br>"Anywhere else this would be a sackable offence," Jackson laughed as she followed Heather's lead with one of her breasts. "Here it's expected."<br><br>"You don't say," Heather gasped having already run a hand down to her clit. And one wet finger into her slit. Jackson followed her, almost in a trance. She felt almost hypnotised as she watched and copied everything she saw Heather do on the screen.<br><br>Heather spread her legs wide, wanked herself with both hands, smiling directly at Jackson as she worked her clit with one hand, imbedding two fingers of her other hand, working them in and out of her tunnel. "Do you do it like this?" she groaned, her eyes half closed.<br><br>Jackson was doing the same as Heather, nodding wordlessly as she absorbed herself into their shared pleasure. She closed her eyes for a moment, to concentrate on herself, suddenly opening them, awakened by a sudden, stronger groan from Heather. A pair of hands covered Heather's breasts, groping them, caressing them gently then squeezing them together, the fingers never off Heather's nipples.<br><br>Heather spread her legs wider for deeper access to her pleasure. The woman groping her breasts leant down to french kiss her, her wavy blonde hair obscuring both their faces. Eventually she pulled back from their passion. Jackson recognised Heather's American girlfriend. Of course it was Chrissy. And of course the gorgeous blonde was naked. After all, she was a mailgirl too.<br><br>"What do you have going on here without me," Chrissy demanded, a smile on her face. Her fingers had not left Heather's breasts.<br><br>Along with Jackson, Heather had returned to reality. "I'm teaching Jackson how to wank," Heather replied.<br><br>"Does she really need to learn that?" Chrissy demanded. "I didn't know," she added slyly. Chrissy let go of one of Heather's breasts so she could ease herself next to her girlfriend, closer to the laptop to get a better view of Jackson's efforts. She gripped Heather's other breast harder getting a squeal from her girlfriend. "Do you really need to learn how to wank?" she asked Jackson, staring at the camera on the laptop as if she was assessing what Jackson was doing. "You're a quick learner," Chrissy added with one hand now working her own slit.<br><br>Jackson played up to her. "Yes, I need her to show me, to teach me properly," she smiled, copying everything that Heather was still doing. "You too," she moaned. All three thrust their hips, getting into a rhythm, trying, getting close to cumming.<br><br>Chrissy stopped her work to stare at Heather. "You never taught me how to wank myself," she complained.<br><br>Heather rolled her eyes at that. "Girlfriend, you taught me things I didn't know could be done."<br><br>Chrissy pretended to be offended. "You could have asked," she pouted. She placed both her hands dramatically on her hips. Heather whimpered a soft complaint that her breasts were no longer being mauled.<br><br>Jackson was so close to cumming. But she needed something more. "Show me what you taught Heather," she urged Chrissy.<br><br>"Oh all right," Chrissy huffed. She settled next to Heather, spreading her legs with one placed over the top of Heather's as they both faced Jackson, their pussies on display to her. Chrissy reached down and grabbed her lips stretching them up. She went for her clit and almost immediately started to thrust.<br><br>"She's so orgasmic," Heather admired. But Jackson did not answer. Watching Chrissy was what she needed to get her over the top, get into her own right place. Something about the physicality, the presence of the tall, hardbodied blonde American. Jackson came hard. Spread back in her seat, she spasmed once, twice, again and again. She could not believe how hard she came. She smiled at the two on the couch in America. It was what she needed.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>The buxom mailgirl Monika Mayhem was the last one out of the showers. The other mailgirls were already sort of lined up for their morning inspection. Only four others were present, Kimiko, Annette, Pam and June.<br><br>Wendy Turnbull, their clothed supervisor, stood with them. "All the rest are away," she confirmed, "you're going to have to work extra hard today." Which got a general smile from the five assembled. Except of course Kimiko who kept a straight face like she would handle whatever was thrown at her.<br><br>Monika smiled at June who seemed a little unsure. "Extra hard," Monika repeated at other relative novice like it mattered. Then she smiled again. They had both only recently first stripped off and started their mailgirl careers. Their nakedness, the stripping in the morning, and spending their days wandering nude through the office was still somewhat of a novelty. While Pam and Annette, like Kimiko, were almost complacent with their office nudity. The way they stood, the way they moved, they may have been just as well wearing clothes. Monika, despite her tough-girl performance, still looked too aware that her prominent bust was an attraction along with the rest of her body. June seemed unsure of the whole thing which, she did not realise, created an aura of vulnerability, a desirable allure about her, which was the last thing that she wanted.<br><br>"There are rules," Annette reminded the other mailgirls as well as Wendy. "No one gets overworked or hurt."<br><br>"It was more a figure of speech," Wendy apologised.<br><br>Monika smiled at Annette, admiringly. "We know who the shop steward is when Jackson's not around."<br><br>Annette poked her tongue out. "She's teaching me," she told the group which got a laugh.<br><br>Suddenly there was action from the entrance. Rosemary the journalist strode in, followed by her cameraperson, the ever suffering Trisha Noble who, camera poised and operating, struggled to keep up with her. With one action, Rosemary stripped her dress over her head. It was all that she was wearing.<br><br>"I'm here to help!" she announced to the five naked women staring at her. "And it looks like today you could do with my assistance."<br><br>Annette's four colleagues all looked to her, waiting for her leadership. Finally Pam spoke up. "Well Annette, you say Jackson has been training you up. What are you going to do?"<br><br>Annette stood there, legs slightly apart, one hand on her hip, the other scratching just above her ear. She looked to each of the other mailgirls while Rosemary stood slightly off to the side. "Well," Annette concluded, "what can we do?"<br><br>"Exactly," Rosemary called back to her. And strode up to Annette to give her a big, close hug.<br><br>Pam was not impressed. "I'll bet that if Jackson was here that was not what she would do."<br><br>Rosemary shifted her hand to squeeze Annette's bottom. She was brazen.<br><br>Annette lifted the prying hand away from her butt, disengaged herself from Rosemary and looked Pam in the eyes. "And I'll bet that you're right," she told her colleague. "But she's not here. And there's only the five of us here. She can help. We do need it."<br><br>Wendy coughed to attract their attention. "There are rules," she reminded them all and looked to Rosemary. "Has this been approved?" she asked the journalist.<br><br>Rosemary smiled sweetly at the supervisor. "Why not ask him?" she offered. Wendy went to her app and sent a compliant Kimiko up to get Shane. Catching the lift down, Shane appeared presently, long before Kimiko could return down the stairs. In his usual way, Shane sauntered in, that eternal grin on his face as he encountered the five naked women who were waiting for him. Shane being Shane strode up to Rosemary and gave her a hug and kiss on the lips.<br><br>None of the mailgirls were fazed, not even June who after all had already had already had a session with Shane. She looked almost jealous that it was Rosemary, rather than her. But said nothing.<br><br>"Are you two fucking, Shane?" Monika asked as if it was the most likely thing and any reply in the negative would be a lie.<br><br>Shane gave Monika his seductive smile. "No, not fucking," he told the mailgirl while still holding Rosemary by the waist. Rosemary smiled at him, everyone in the room could sense their chemistry. "Only a headjob so far," Shane revealed.<br><br>"Nice way to share," Rosemary complained. Annette slapped her loudly on the butt like, c'mon girl, what were you just doing to me?<br><br>Again none of the mailgirls seemed confronted with that. "So you don't fuck all the mailgirls?" June asked dispassionately.<br><br>"Not all of them," Shane admitted turning his grin onto Pam.<br><br>"Only a headjob here too," Pam admitted to the rest.<br><br>June nodded like their discussion was the most natural thing between a bunch of naked office workers and one of the bosses. Then she noticed that Kimiko had slunk back in. "You're quiet, Kimiko," June observed. "Do you have anything to add to this?" Kimiko gave her a warning glance. But June did not cower. "I'm new at this," she announced, "and I've already fucked Shane because I thought that's what we did."<br><br>"And now you find that you could have stopped at a headjob," Pam smiled.<br><br>Rosemary looked over to Trisha who was still filming. "Are you getting all this?" Rosemary asked her camera operator who nodded some sort of yes. It was pretty superfluous because clearly Trisha was recording it all.<br><br>"I could have stopped at a headjob, I guess," June shrugged. "But just as well. He was a pretty good fuck. So I guess it was worth it." She could not believe that she was telling the other that. But it seemed somehow appropriate.<br><br>Annette stared at newest mailgirl, the way that she stood, shielding her pussy from full view, her shoulders slightly hunched and shook her head. "I can't see it, but if you say so," Annette smiled at June.<br><br>"Maybe I'll get to see you in action," Rosemary told Shane, grabbing his crotch through his pants. While she stared over at June who avoided her eye contact.<br><br>"Don't do that!" Annette snapped at Rosemary. "You'll get him started. Not that he needs an excuse."<br><br>June suddenly grew assertive. She rounded on Kimiko who was settling back in her usual place over in the corner, away from the action. "Hey Kimiko," she called over to her, "have you got up to anything with our resident service man here?" Or was she just trying to deflect. After all, Rosemary had goaded Shane to fuck June in front of all of them. Which she was not sure about. Well, maybe...<br><br>And Kimiko did not seem interested in spilling her experiences. But the others knew. "Tell her Kimiko," Annette demanded.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Pam was wanking on the landing when Rosemary came through the Level 6 door, from the executive suite, to descend back to the mezzanine, with Trisha following behind, doing her job. Rosemary looked at her, watched her nonchalantly work on herself with a toy from the dildo station like it was the most natural thing for an employee to do during the working day. She shook her head. "I still can't believe that attractive intelligent women like you would do this, work naked in a job in this day and age."<br><br>Pam eased a little further down onto the dildo and smiled with satisfaction at the journalist. "Yet here you are, like us. What are you really looking for?"<br><br>Rosemary stood defiantly over the mailgirl who kept on pleasuring herself. "I'm trying to find out what makes you tick."<br><br>Pam smiled up at her beckoning her closer, indicating that Rosemary should sit and join her. "But something is making you tick too, isn't it?" she told the reporter. "What are you finding out by experiencing it yourself?" Pam seemed genuinely interested in that. Rosemary agreeably sat next to her and Pam offered her a dildo that she must have had by her side. Rosemary started at that, not sure whether to accept it.<br><br>"Don't worry," Pam assured her, "I haven't used it yet."<br><br>"Were you expecting me?" Rosemary asked accepting the sex toy like it was a dangerous item.<br><br>"No," Pam assured her, "I just hadn't decided how I was going to use it yet. Since I had the other one. And knew what to do with that."<br><br>Rosemary placed the dildo near her lips. Carefully she ran it along her slit before pushing it just a little way in.<br><br>"That's it," Pam applauded, "only, what, six inches to go." She watched the other woman start to pleasure herself with the device. "You turn it on there," Pam indicated. "Now what is going on in that head of yours? What are you really trying to find out?"<br><br>Rosemary leaned back against Pam and sighed as she fully embedded her dildo. "There is a freedom about all this, isn't there? I guess that's why you do it." Pam did not answer, choosing to just watch and let Rosemary go on with what she was doing to herself, Pam suspecting that Rosemary had only just begun. While she worked the dildo against her most sensitive parts, Rosemary tried to arrange her thoughts. "It's like going to a dress-up party, being something, someone other than yourself. Like I said it's the freedom. I feel I could do anything."<br><br>Pam looked over to Trisha who was filming all the proceedings and gave the camerawoman a raised eyebrow, a look of curiosity which Trisha returned. Neither of them could work out what the outcome of Rosemary's visit would be. It certainly did not look to either of them like something that would be on a television current affairs show at 6.30pm, in the evening.<br><br>Rosemary seemed to Pam to be in her own world as she got herself off with the dildo and with her fingers. Which allowed Pam to ponder further, what Rosemary was up to? The mailgirl extracted her own dildo and carefully placed it pointing upwards on the stairs, then got up from her spot on the landing easing herself next to Trisha who kept filming the reporter from as close as she could get good framing of Rosemary in action.<br><br>Pam placed a hand on Trisha's shoulder to lean up close so they could talk privately. "What do you think she's up to?" Pam asked the camera operator while Rosemary spread her legs giving her observers a clear view of exactly what she was doing with the dildo. She was also muttering something about the future of work.<br><br>"I have no idea," Trisha admitted in an equally sharp whisper, holding the camera steady careful not to miss anything. "This wasn't the plan."<br><br>"What was the plan?" Pam whispered back.<br><br>"To get a few shots of Rosemary being a mailgirl, to see what the reaction of the fabrics would be to her delivering their messages, get another interview with your boss and get out."<br><br>"And?" Pam asked. She still had her hand on Trisha's upper arm so they could easily whisper into each other's ears.<br><br>"We got all those, except we haven't had the interview yet. I honestly thought that's all that we were coming in here for." Trisha pointed back to the door they had come through. Rosemary was now riffing about female empowerment, getting sex the way that they want it. Trisha eyed her performance with keen eye for the production. She leant over close to Pam. "You don't think that you could go down..." she wondered. "Get her to cum so we can move on."<br><br>Was the camerawoman uncomfortable around naked mailgirls, Pam wondered. Was she getting affected? Pam ran that hand of hers on Trisha's arm down her side and straight into her pants. She reached inside Trisha's underwear, felt the top of her bush. Then she reached just that little further.<br><br>Which triggered a response. "Not me," Trisha stage whispered, "her!" Pam pulled her hand back with an apologetic look. The camera woman smiled regardless. "Thanks anyway," she grinned, "you almost had me." Pam grinned back and immediately slid her hand down where it had been, this time just a fraction lower. Trisha let her do it for a moment then shook her head. "Sorry, but one of us has to remain professional," she determined. "Do her, if that's all right?" she tried.<br><br>Pam reached that little bit lower into the other woman's pants, just into the top of Trisha's slit, just for a quick feel, then another one before she was out. Pam was still close enough to give Trisha a consolation peck on the cheek before she turned to the reporter to work out the best way to take things with her to the next level. And noted that Trisha did not flinch when Pam riffled her fingers along the camera person's arm as she took a step towards the reporter.<br><br>Rosemary squeezed her eyes closed, her head thrown back as she concentrated on cumming, on her own pleasure, now thrusting the dildo as fast as she could. Pam abandoned the camerawoman and sidled towards the squirming reporter. From her modelling experience Pam sensed Trisha's best camera angles, where she needed to stand to be in shot but not obscure the other woman's performance. Although she stood back, Trisha had all of Rosemary in shot, the thrusting of her crotch, her legs splayed wide, breasts glistening and eyes tight shut to concentrate on fucking herself.<br><br>Pam came into frame from the side and knelt next to Rosemary, between her legs but wary of obscuring the camera. A dark thought suddenly came to her mind. She covered Rosemary's hands with her own so that she was controlling the dildo. At first Rosemary tensed but then she relaxed as Pam controlled the rhythm the way Rosemary wanted. Without warning Pam slipped it out of the other woman and into her bottom. Going for broke, Pam pressed it in and out with the same tempo that Rosemary had been attacking her pussy.<br><br>Rosemary did not miss a beat, moaning as Pam pressed the object in. She was beyond caring for anything other than her own wants. And now with the reporter's pussy open and exposed, Pam leaned down and, from the side, began to tongue her. She knew that Trisha was happily capturing it all.<br><br>Even better for Rosemary, her hands were free to press down on the back of Pam's head. "Yes," she cried out, "yes, Peter, like that!"<br><br>Pam wondered for a moment who the fuck is Peter? Well whatever, she decided. I'll be Peter if she wants Peter. She glanced up at Trisha who had clearly just realised something, no doubt worked out who Peter was. Pam did not care. She found that she was getting into it, getting wet herself, not caring about the nagging thought at the back of her mind that the pornographic display that she was now part of with Trisha filming it diligently, what could it possibly be used for?<br><br>But that worry dissolved when she reached over to where she had left her own dildo. She needed that so badly now. And soon she was coming from her own work at the same time that Rosemary came, loud and high on her own sensations.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson was ten minutes early. Lauryn was five minutes late. Even though Jackson was the only patron in the restaurant, their waitress led Lauryn to Jackson's table like she did not want her to get lost or something. The waitress helped to settle her in, like certain standards had been maintained.<br><br>Jackson smiled at her friend. "I don't know how a restaurant that gets 16 out of 20 can be empty at seven o'clock on a Thursday night."<br><br>Lauryn smiled back as she flicked through the menu. "Maybe it scares everyone off. Except for us."<br><br>Jackson nodded. "Let's take advantage of it." She waved to the waitress who came over to take their orders. Alone again, Jackson could concentrate on the former mailgirl sitting across from her. "Tell me everything," Jackson insisted.<br><br>Lauryn rolled her eyes. "Yes, people have seen Harada on my CV. So yes, I get the questions. 'What's it like to have mailgirls in your office? Did you use them? Don't you find it demeaning?' All the sort of questions you would expect."<br><br>Jackson nodded. "No one's guessed? Or suggested?"<br><br>Lauryn smiled confidently. "No, they assume that a BA who can dress herself in casual office wear and who can log in to a computer, open spreadsheets and send emails could never have been a mailgirl." She gestured down at what she was wearing, nothing outrageous or suggestive. "Mailgirls, Lauryn continued, "are 'them.' And they've decided that I'm clearly not them, I'm one of us. But of course they ask me questions all the time about it. The men and of course the women."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "You secret ex-mailgirl you! And what did you say to that?"<br><br>Lauryn laughed. "Of course I used the mailgirls..."<br><br>"...but not in the way that they think." Jackson shook her head at how predictable people could be.<br><br>Lauryn nodded. "Indeed."<br><br>They had small talk to catch up on, updates by Jackson on who at Harada was doing what. Except for Kimiko, a subject Lauryn was careful to avoid to save her friend from any awkwardness. But Lauryn wanted to know about the other mailgirls. After all, she had some deep roots there, they both knew that she could not just let go.<br><br>Then Jackson got serious. "I found out the whole story about your new place," she divulged. "Famechon took you at face value as a BA, they liked your credentials for the job. But apparently when someone at Famechon was validating your background they clicked that we are the mailgirls company. Realising that both companies were somewhat similar, your bosses thought about it and decided why not? Apparently Harada has a good reputation in the industry. Both for its work and for its mailgirls." Jackson thrust her breasts forward, mocking a proud pose. "We are the industry leaders!"<br><br>"You have to be the leaders when you're the only one," Lauryn chortled.<br><br>Soon to get competition, so we'll have to lift our game, somehow. Anyhow, Famechon have no idea about you-know-what, that's what Belinda told me."<br><br>Lauryn thought about it for a moment. "Why then didn't she tell me?" she asked. "The mysteries of HR, I guess."<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "She thought it would be better if I told you. I don't know, maybe my bedside manner or something." They both laughed at that. "It's cool. Come on, you just have to convince your new colleagues that you know how to work with naked women. You can help them understand how to treat mailgirls with respect and all that. You don't have any reason to let on that you were..."<br><br>Lauryn nodded. "Well, if you put it like that..."<br><br>The waitress was suddenly with them, a listening look on her face. "No," both of the patrons told her sharply. She recoiled. "I was only going to ask you if you want dessert," she stammered.<br><br>Jackson laughed, then Lauryn. "We better look at the menu," Jackson decided. The waitress smiled and retreated carefully.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "I thought she was going to ask..." she started.<br><br>Lauryn grinned back. "Not everyone is going to ask you if they can be a mailgirl too," she stated out loud.<br><br>"Or ask what it's like," Jackson continued. She then circled back to her earlier information. "The way that Belinda framed it, they will probably come to you for suggestions about how it can work, how you fabrics are supposed to treat and respect your mailgirls, that sort of thing. I think it can all work."<br><br>Lauryn gave Jackson a dangerous smile. "So I'm supposed to know how to treat a mailgirl? That could be, um, a revelation. Hopefully you can show this Business Analyst the respect that she deserves."<br><br>Jackson bowed her head in mock submission. "That can be done," she agreed. "But tell me, what do you miss about it? Anything?"<br><br>Lauryn looked carefully at how far away the waitress was. "Well, there was the constant getting off. I never would have thought that I could cum so many times in a day. And then the next day. And the next..."<br><br>Jackson looked caringly at her friend. "But even though you never really accepted the, well, lifestyle."<br><br>Lauryn squirmed a bit. "Well yeah. Maybe it was guilt, I don't know. Or just a sense that the constant exposure, and I'll admit, the constant buzz down there. Well it wasn't something meant for me. Does that make any sense?"<br><br>Jackson thought about it. "Well, a little. I mean I can't believe how quickly I got into the whole swing of it. Now it's just natural for me. I almost feel weird like this. I would be comfortable being naked in here now and happily wanking away. Getting pleasure from my work!" She stared seriously at Lauryn for a moment then gave her a big grin. "I can't believe I feel like that. Who would have thought that was me?"<br><br>Lauryn grinned back. "Go on, do it."<br><br>"What? I couldn't."<br><br>Lauryn felt a little bit naughty. But she pressed. "Come on, you said it would feel natural to you." She even reached over the table and took Jackson's hand in hers, even started to caress her palm. Jackson looked worriedly around the room and caught the eye of the waitress who thought that she had been summoned for desserts. She started to walk over. Lauryn did not let go of Jackson's hand as the waitress walked up to them.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Monika pushed a second bar table up next to the one that they already had. Much more room for their drinks now. "It's a good niche," Pam noted, "it's almost private."<br><br>June looked over to Annette. "Is this all that's coming?" she asked the mailgirl they looked up to when Jackson was not around.<br><br>"I tried the others, but didn't get an answer from any of them," Annette told the other three. "Not even from Jackson. She's either sick or up to something."<br><br>"By the way," June added, "I like your dress." Annette laughed and raised the hem which sat at her heels right up, showing the other mailgirls a lot of bare thigh. She dropped it rather than reveal if she had anything on underneath. She was also looking over June's shoulders. Of course a group of four vivacious women would attract sneak peaks, hopes of connecting, and looks of interest from the other patrons.<br><br>Annette suddenly brightened up and then waved at someone she recognised. It was Kimiko who came over holding a glass, looking as assured as she joined the rest of the mailgirls who were all quietly enjoying being in public, being dressed, and sharing their secret knowledge of their workday routines. No, the world did not have to know.<br><br>"Glad you could make it," Annette greeted the late arrival. "But what are you drinking?"<br><br>Kimiko sipped her drink and shrugged. "Straight coke," she admitted. "I'm not a drinker."<br><br>Pam leaned down to give Kimiko a peck on the cheek. "Where's Mrs Ogawa?" Pam asked her. This was after all a chance to catch up on events that they did not discuss at work before they got onto their main issue.<br><br>"Oh," Kimiko updated the others, "she got called back to Tokyo. But she's going to be back soon."<br><br>"It must be hard for her here not knowing the language?" Annette asked.<br><br>Kimiko gave her a deep look. "How do you know that she doesn't know English?"<br><br>The other mailgirls' expressions dropped. "Oh," Annette and Pam gasped. They had not thought of that before. What if Mrs Ogawa was bluffing about only speaking Japanese.<br><br>"So can she speak English?" June asked, for the definitive answer.<br><br>"I have spoken English to her," Kimiko admitted, "I've tried, but I don't know if she understands or not. She's not one to give much away."<br><br>The others looked hard at Kimiko, all their stares saying 'you're not one to give much away either.' Unperturbed, Monika addressed Kimiko, looking straight at her, no getting away. "What do you do there in your corner, on your laptop," she came at it directly.<br><br>Kimiko did not seem fussed by Monika's question. "We're not going to be mailgirls forever," she stated. "Mostly it's study, keeping up with things in my profession so I'm ready for that day. And you know that my previous job was in the finance department, so there's a lot to keep up with there, it keeps me occupied." She looked around their faces, sensed a lack of response. And smiled. "Sorry, that it's not any more exciting than that." She smiled wider. "I don't know what you think I was doing." And left that to hang in the air.<br><br>Since the others could not think of any reply to that, they changed the topic to the one that was fresh in their minds. Monika verbalised it first. "What was Rosemary up to?" she asked the others.<br><br>Kimiko looked surprised. "I thought she just came in to get some more mailgirl footage she can use in another segment where she raises it as a big scare?" She obvious had not been paying attention. Or maybe they had not crossed paths during the day.<br><br>Annette looked over to Pam. "Tell her what you told me," she urged Pam. "Then let's try to see if we can make any sense of it."<br><br>Pam checked her phone and smiled at the others. "I can do better than that," she revealed, looking out into the wider bar area, from where Kimiko had just come. She waved over to the bar, and the subject of her interest came towards them. Pam gave her a more than friendly kiss on the cheek. "You should all know Trisha," she told the others. Kimiko at least looked blank. "Rosemary's cameraperson," Pam reminded Kimiko, and the others.<br><br>"Hi," Trisha started carefully, still wary of Pam's hand on her shoulder blade. Where it had been in their encounter on the stairs.<br><br>Not that Pam cared. "Does Rosemary know that you're here?" she asked her guest.<br><br>"Hell no," Trisha laughed.<br><br>Pam held onto Trisha as she addressed the others. "Some of the stuff that Trisha shot of Rosemary and me, it was pretty..."<br><br>"...pornographic," Trisha jumped in, straightforward. That raised eyebrows. Well, why not?<br><br>"There we were on the stairs suddenly. And I had a spare dildo," Pam explained. Like that was a normal thing. Which for mailgirls, well...<br><br>"Was it a set-up?" June asked, fairly enough. Pam and Trisha looked to each other, both shook their heads. "Well, what do you think her plan is, in that case?" June asked.<br><br>Pam shrugged. Trisha looked around the group, judging if she could trust them. Evidently she did. She took a deep breath. "Well, she seemed pretty happy with the stuff we shot when we reviewed it at the end of the day. Let's face it, she pretty much filmed a porno. I think she sees a niche in the market, to film a real, a hardcore Mailgirls Down Under."<br><br>Annette pulled a face. "She's going to need our consent."<br><br>Trisha shook her head. "Not if it's mostly her. But I have a suspicion." She looked around the group for support again, realised that she had already gone too far if she could not trust them. "Rosemary's actually not all that smart. I reckon she's been taken in by the tales of women making fortunes on Only Fans and the like, and she reckons that she can leverage off her fame as a well recognised TV presenter into a career doing that and make even more money than she's making now."<br><br>Kimiko grunted. "Any career she has on Only Fans is not going to be anywhere near as long lasting or ultimately lucrative than if she sticks with her journalism. Sorry, it's the accountant in me escaping. But it's not a career path." She smiled to lessen the impact.<br><br>Trisha was not fazed. "I don't think she's thought through it that far."<br><br>Monika summed it up. "So it's going to be just her, she gets to do her mailgirl thing around the office. And then she puts it out and gets a lot of free publicity based on her public fame. So there won't be another segment on TV?"<br><br>Trisha smiled at Monika. "Oh I think there will. There will either be a flaccid follow up to the last one. You know something that promises a lot but doesn't deliver. Or I think something along the lines of how our star reporter got sucked into this decadent lifestyle and look what happened to her, something to kick off her new gig."<br><br>The mailgirls mulled over that for while. Trisha felt emboldened enough to ask some questions — the usual ones — about how the mailgirls did their jobs, how they were treated, why they agreed to do it in the first place.<br><br>Pam took it on herself to answer most of Trisha's questions. So at first Trisha did not realise that it was just her and Pam and they were at the back of the recess, almost in a private room of sorts. "We have some unfinished business," Pam breathed into the other woman's face.<br><br>"I don't know what you mean," Trisha answered, nonplussed. What did she owe them?<br><br>"I think you do," Pam smiled. She slid her hand down the front of Trisha's pants, down to the top of her panties. Back there again.<br><br>"Oh that," Trisha remembered. "I thought we were done with all that." She looked hopefully at the other woman, who had not shifted her hand up or down, just kept it there against the flat of Trisha's belly. She tensed.<br><br>Pam smiled warmly at Trisha. "You only have to say the word," Pam suggested. She played with the elastic of the other woman's panties.<br><br>"The word," Trisha trembled. Their lips moved close together at the same time as Pam's hand went that crucial centimetre lower.<br><br>"I know somewhere we could go," Pam whispered, so close to Trisha's cheek.<br><br>"Take me there," Trisha whispered back. "Please?"<br><br>Pam took her hand out of the other woman's pants, took her hand and walked the two of them out into the night.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>By the light of the moon, Jackson worked the key into her door and stepped in, followed by a grinning Lauryn.<br><br>"What does a mailgirl do when she's inside?" Lauryn laughed.<br><br>"I don't know what you mean?" Jackson tried, knowing that would not work with a lover who had known what to do with her since their student days.<br><br>"I think the mailgirl knows what to do," Lauryn shot back. Jackson quickly stepped out of her clothes. Lauryn nodded. "That's better."<br><br>"Do you have a message for me?" Jackson asked her visitor, lazily flipping one of her own nipples.<br><br>"How about you make me a cup of coffee?" Lauryn quickly decided. "And of course one for yourself, if you want." Lauryn knew that she could not stay in that role for very long, at least with Jackson. It was hard to play the boss when they knew each other's minds and bodies so well.<br><br>Jackson realised that too. "Is it just me or is it the mailgirl thing — it hasn't left you yet?" She stood provocatively in the doorway to her kitchen. "Have you?" Jackson challenged.<br><br>"Too soon to tell," Lauryn admitted. "I guess I'll find out when they start the mailgirls at the new place."<br><br>"You could always say that you were uncomfortable with them at Harada, that's the real reason that you left."<br><br>"Which is kind of true," Lauryn agreed. It was a secret between the two of them that Lauryn had found the mailgirl thing at Harada hard which was why she wanted a way out. "White, no sugar," she called out as Jackson disappeared into the kitchen. Lauryn make her way to Jackson's couch.<br><br>Lauryn was stretched out on the couch although sitting up against the armrest when Jackson appeared with the coffees. "Come here," she beckoned so Jackson placed the mugs down on the coffee table in front of them and leaned back against Lauryn allowing the clothed woman to hold her from behind, play with her exposed breasts then feel her down below.<br><br>"My God you're so wet," Lauryn exclaimed, her fingers deep in Jackson's pussy. "Is it me?" she demanded. "Or has it been a while?" Lauryn looked hard at her friend's face. "Same man problem?" she asked more gently.<br><br>Jackson sighed. "I so need a fuck. But I just can't find a man."<br><br>Lauryn gripped her friend tightly around the waist. The sex could wait a moment. "Same problem. You can't find THE man," she noted.<br><br>Jackson grunted some sort of agreement. "I don't see why I should have to drop my standards. Being with you set them pretty high."<br><br>Lauryn kissed her friend's cheek. And then her mouth. "So my fault. Right." Lauryn held her friend tightly for a moment wondering what she was going to do with her. So many choices.<br><br><br><hr><br><br>On the mezzanine, Jan looked at her app. "Has someone new started?" she asked the others. No one seemed to know. "I have a message from someone in the office next to Mitch's." She looked again. "Interesting. I thought it was generic Harada Industries. But it's actually someone called Harada." She looked over to the usual corner. "Kimiko, do you have any idea?" Kimiko looked up and shrugged. Suggesting strongly no. Jan looked again. "Young Harada," she read off the app. "Does that mean anything, Kimiko?"<br><br>This time Kimiko looked engaged. "That's one of my uncles. But don't ask me, I have no idea what he's doing here."<br><br>Jan smiled bravely. "Guess I'll just have to find out." She strode to the exit, ready to climb the stairs. If Young Harada was Kimiko's uncle, then he was one of the owner's sons. What was he doing unannounced in an office in their Melbourne building. She guessed that she would find out, very soon.<br><br>The mailgirls were not yet to know that Young Harada had arrived unannounced in the Melbourne office. He had appeared in the office that day and gone straight to see Lindsay Davenport to tell her that he was to be part of the Australian management team. Lindsay knew enough of the company politics to guess that Mr Harada must have wanted his younger son out of his hair for a while. No doubt the boss had some hope that Young Harada would go back to Tokyo a better company man than he left. You could always hope. Lindsay had Shane escort him from her sixth floor office to the vacant one on the tenth floor.<br><br>Shane was canny enough to assure Young Harada that he wasn't being shovelled out of the way, that Stuart Broad, another of the management team was on the eleventh floor and the HR Head who was also part of management was on the ninth. "It's designed for management to stay in touch with the staff, close to them," Shane assured him.<br><br>But Young Harada was quite idle when Jan knocked on his door. He had not ventured out to meet the staff outside. What, he wondered, should a manager be doing? He instructed the mailgirl to enter. Jan, tall, blonde, slim-hipped, pert breasted and of course naked, strode in to face the new manager. He sat behind his desk, a little sweaty, a little pudgy, a little unshaven. Not at his best after the flight, Jan wondered. Or was this normal?<br><br>"Come in and sit on my desk," he told the mailgirl.<br><br>"I thought you had a message for me to deliver," Jan asked primly, aware that prim did not work much in her state.<br><br>"That can wait," the manager told her patting the desk.<br><br>"Why do you want me there?" Jan asked. She stood her ground, well out of reach.<br><br>"So I can see if you're wet when you spread your legs," Young Harada told her like it was part of normal procedure.<br><br>Jan crossed her arms to hide her breasts. "I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that here," she tried gently.<br><br>Young Harada felt he could not back right down. "Mr Harada said I could have any of the mailgirls here," he told the mailgirl without really looking at her.<br><br>Jan shook her head. "Mr Harada was talking out of his arse." She was still being careful, not too forceful about how far this new arrival had crossed over the local boundaries. The owner's son and all that too.<br><br>Not that Young Harada picked up on any of that. "Oh, you're funny," he cackled. "Talking out of my arse. I like that!"<br><br>Jan took a step back but smiled. "You weren't supposed to understand that," she admitted.<br><br>Young Harada kept his calm. "I think you'll find that I can follow your idioms. I did my research. I watched a season of Home And Away."<br><br>Jan laughed. "You poor bastard."<br><br>Young Harada got into the act. "She'll be right, mate," he recited emphasising each word, killing the nuance.<br><br>Jan laughed harder. "Stop it, just stop it!" she pleaded.<br><br>"Why cobber?" Young Harada responded.<br><br>Jan shook her head. "No one here talks like that," she insisted.<br><br>"But I'm funny," Young Harada insisted, "stone the crows, look, you are laughing."<br><br>Jan crossed her hands over her chest again. "Listen," she tried, "we talk normally here. Just use the English that you had before you started on your misguided linguistic crusade through the worst of Australian culture. Can you promise me that?"<br><br>But before Young Harada could answer, Annette burst into the office. She gripped Jan by the arm and smiled at Young Harada. "How're they hanging mate?" she asked him. Then looked to Jan. "Kimiko told me what he might be like. I eventually got something out of her," she whispered to the other mailgirl. "So I thought you may need some support."<br><br>Annette looked over to Young Harada who grinned back at her. "Two of you at the same time!" he exclaimed, excited now.<br><br>Standing back with Pam, Annette gave the new manager a patronising smile. "I think we need to explain the Melbourne rules to you," she warned him. Arms crossed, her stance suggested that there were indeed rules that he would have to learn. And for the first time, the smile on his face faded just a little.<br><br>`

                    content: `Welcome to Mailgirls Down Under Spotlight. I edited these excerpts out of the main story for the usual reasons — they didn't work in the original stories, they didn't fit in the timeline, Jackson did not approve at the time, that sort of thing. There are more which I will publish in this series every so often. Sometimes it will be obvious where they fit in the Mailgirls Down Under Universe, sometimes not so obvious. But hopefully they will be as much fun as the regular series.<br><br>Firstly, a quick recap for those not immersed in the story: The Japanese boss of Harada Industries ordered the Australian subsidiary to introduce mailgirls, which they already have in their offices in Japan and The States. The local management struggled with how to introduce naked mailgirls down under, given Australia's restrictive workplace laws. After lawyers and other experts turned down the task of drafting the mailgirls' contracts, the Australian office boss Mitchell Johnson turned to Marjorie "call me Jackson" Jackson, a union official who usually works with sex workers, to help Harada Industries come up with a mailgirls employment contract and to start a program that is acceptable to the Japanese boss and the Australian authorities.<br><br>To her surprise, on the eve of their mailgirls launch, that local boss, Mitchell Johnson, invited Jackson to become an inaugural mailgirl on a short-term contract, ostensibly because they need her expertise to ensure that the mailgirls program ran smoothly at the start. Now she had to make up her mind whether to accept the role. Is that something she would like to do? Did she expect this not too old, handsome man to ask her to work naked for him?<br><br>Excerpt 1 — Jackson discusses whether to become a mailgirl with her friend.<br><br>Fanny Durack sat across from Jackson stirring her coffee and looking eager. But then Fanny Durack always looked eager when she knew she was about to share a confidence. Always seeming to be busy, the trainee psychologist was studying mailgirls for her thesis which was why Jackson had chosen to drop her bombshell on her. Jackson knew that meant Fanny would give her the third degree when she broke the news. Still, Fanny was a friend she could trust. And the one who knew the most about mailgirls.<br><br>"Out with it!" Fanny insisted with a smile.<br><br>Jackson took a deep breath and looked Fanny in the eyes. "I'm going to work for Harada Industries," she revealed.<br><br>Fanny beamed. "The mailgirl company!" She stared at Jackson with hopeful expectation. "You're not?" With wide eyes, the works.<br><br>Jackson tried to tamp the excitement down. "I've been helping them write their employment conditions, making sure that they're acceptable to the Fair Work Commission. And, well, making the rules a bit more female friendly than they had originally planned."<br><br>"And they want you to become one." Fanny was excited.<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "They want me to be there to help with the launch and making sure everything goes smoothly."<br><br>"You could do that with your clothes on."<br><br>"But that's not what they've offered. And..."<br><br>Fanny's eyes lit up further, if that was possible. "And?!"<br><br>Jackson looked embarrassed. The thin, seriously dressed, usually assertive women looked down at the table in front of her, trying to avoid Fanny's enthusiasm. "And the money. They're paying a lot. And," she faltered a little, "I am curious."<br><br>Fanny sat there for a moment, cogitating. "I'm trying to imagine my upright diligent friend running errands, naked in an office. Have you agreed to?"<br><br>"Well, I'm thinking about it..." Jackson started.<br><br>Fanny reached across to clasp Jackson's hand in hers. Which forced Jackson to look up at Fanny. "Okay, you want some advice from the mailgirl expert. You want to know what you're going to get yourself into? Let me explain. First of all, have you seen the videos?"<br><br>Jackson nodded. "Some of them, I guess."<br><br>"And when was the last time you were naked in front of more than one person?" Jackson smiled sheepishly at that but did not answer. "Don't tell me it's one of your fantasies!" Fanny exploded. Jackson's smile remained coy, defensive.<br><br>Fanny realised she should change tack. "How about your career?" Fanny asked, shifting to something safer. Jackson shrugged. They had talked often about Jackson's dedication to her job, the excessive hours that she was putting into it, and the question of where she expected her career to go. Still Jackson looked squeamish, still she did not answer.<br><br>"Are you planning to prove a point?" Fanny tried.<br><br>Jackson found some oxygen there and invoked one of her standard concerns about sex work. "That a girl can exploit and be exploited at the same time? Don't worry, I wrote the contracts. I thought about that."<br><br>Fanny gave her friend a confused look. "You may have written the contracts. But the job is essentially spending your day going around an office naked, you know, with people looking at you. And getting punished for anything you stuff up."<br><br>Jackson smiled. And perked up as she shook her head knowingly. "I wrote the contracts. There is no punishment. Only incentives for doing the job better than expected." Now she smiled with pride.<br><br>Fanny looked impressed. "Neat, that's different to The States. I didn't expect that. Now I have to find out how this is going to work." She thought for a moment. "Girl, no wonder they wanted you. This is radical. Apart from the other thing." She gave Jackson an enigmatic look.<br><br>"What other thing?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"Well despite what you think, you're pretty good looking. I'm going to make a guess here. Someone in that company decided that they want to see you without any clothes on." Fanny's look strongly said 'come on, tell me who it is.' Jackson pretended that she had no idea who. So Fanny went onto her academic interest in the subject. "This is really interesting, it's not going to be mailgirls as we know it. From what you told me so far. And I'm going to guess there's more?" Jackson stared at Fanny, didn't say anything, rather let her continue. Fanny, excited was speaking quickly now. "Knowing all that, I am now getting behind you. You have to become a mailgirl. Why? So I can see how this social experiment plays out. You will report back to me. And even better, this is all happening in my home town too. This time I don't have to try to work out what is happening thousands of miles away." Fanny looked very pleased. "I get to sit ringside while you tell me everything."<br><br>Jackson nodded a vague promise to do that. But she needed to hear more from Fanny. "Look, I'm happy if my sacrifice is going to help out your research. But seriously what do you think it will do to my career?"<br><br>Fanny put on her serious face. "Okay then, about you. What about your career?"<br><br>Jackson stirred her coffee. "This is 2023, what is a career? What am I going to be doing in five years' time. Still fighting for the rights of sex workers? And if I take, I don't know, two years away from that?" She pulled a pretended disgust face. "What if I enjoy doing it?" And then she got serious again. "But me, working naked. I mean that was never part of the plan. Will this close doors for me? I don't know, what doors it might open..."<br><br>Fanny gave Jackson her serious 'over the top of her glasses' look. "And the man who made you the offer..."<br><br>"Mitch," Jackson tried to be matter-of-fact about him.<br><br>"Mitch," Fanny juicily repeated, a knowing smirk on her face. "He'll be there, hunky in his business suit. You'll be naked. Totally naked. Bare tits, pussy right out there where everyone can see. Fully exposed. You're going to have to sleep with this guy. Mitch," she pronounced firmly.<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "I guess." She thought about it for a moment. "No!" she decided.<br><br>Fanny exploded in laughter. "That would be perfect! No sex for the naked mailgirl! Your weird attitude to sex will be my next research topic."<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "Weird attitude? Not sleeping with the people I work with?"<br><br>Fanny gave Jackson a knowing look. "Even the ones who want to see you naked there?"<br><br>Jackson sighed. "There you go again. Everything is a research topic to you. If you're not careful, I'll turn you into a mailgirl too."<br><br>Fanny ignored that for a moment then suddenly seemed inspired. "Maybe," she riffed, "see if you can?" She gave Jackson a sly look, then reverted to being the researcher. "Tell me, have you trialled the being in the nude part. How are you planning to do that?"<br><br>"I haven't agreed to the role yet," Jackson complained.<br><br>Fanny gave her another knowing look. "I think you have. You just haven't actually said yes. Have you thought about the first time you are going to appear naked in front of your handsome Mr Johnson?"<br><br>Jackson concentrated on her coffee, acted serious again. "It's funny because I've been working with him over the past little while with my clothes on. And suddenly he springs this."<br><br>Fanny clapped her hands. "That's exactly why it's my research area. Isn't it fascinating? All the permutations, all the embarrassment. And not to add whether it's turning you on. Are you turned on now, talking about it?"<br><br>Jackson looked aghast. "Fanny!"<br><br>Fanny was unperturbed. "You're going to be roaming an office naked all day soon. And you're telling me that you haven't considered whether it's going to turn you on. Showing yourself off like that to everyone who is lucky enough to work there. You're going to be attracted to some of the people. And what if they are attracted to you? Oh, of course it's not about sex, I forgot." She smiled.<br><br>Jackson tried to ignore Fanny's assertions and went completely into officious mode. "That's all in the conditions. They can't do anything, even touch us without our express permission."<br><br>"Your express permission." Fanny seemed to be chewing on that for a moment. "But if they do, if they cross that boundary of behaviour?" Fanny wondered.<br><br>Jackson recited "There are sanctions. I've written them in to the contracts. But we are relying on a combination of general human decency and the career / earnings motivation to keep any problems at bay. You know, ultimately they will want to keep their jobs and not get dismissed for sexual harassment."<br><br>Fanny nodded. "Optimism, I love it. I hope it will work. And I love how you hide behind your rules and conditions." She smiled a sort of victory.<br><br>Jackson looked at her somewhat unnerved. "What do you want me to say? I'm telling you how I've set this up. And if the mailgirl wants something to happen..."<br><br>"Aha," Fanny exclaimed. She then shook her head. "I want to know how you are feeling. You are a career woman with a track record, someone on the up in the union movement, someone with potential, as they say, who is taken seriously in your world. You've given talks and spoken at conferences about what you do. Advocating on behalf of stigmatised workers who don't find it easy to organise in the workplace. Heck, you've even been on Life Matters. And even on The Morning Show with Larry Emdur answering all the hard questions. And you're about to strip off and join the ranks of nude women in the workforce. And you're telling me about the rules that apply to the dressed office workers."<br><br>"Uh," Jackson managed to utter before Fanny cut her off and continued.<br><br>"And don't you dare say 'it's just another job.' Because it's not. You'll be a sexual commodity in a conventional workplace in a way that no one else in Australia is. It's not just another job." Fanny crossed her arms.<br><br>"Well, if you put it like that..."<br><br>"So I'm asking this as a friend as well as a snooping academic, how are you going to feel the first time you are in there without any clothes on, facing a full day fully exposed. And then the day after that. And then..."<br><br>"Okay, I get the point."<br><br>Fanny crossed her arms. "But surely you want to feel what it is like to be naked in public, knowing you cannot just go back and put your clothes on because you've had enough."<br><br>Jackson threw her hands up in surrender. "So what are you suggesting?"<br><br>Fanny uncrossed her arms and drummed her fingers on the table. "That's more like it. Why don't you come back to the lab with me so we can get right into the nitty-gritty."<br><br><br><hr><br><br>Jackson gritted her teeth. Why had she agreed to do this? She walked the short distance from the cafe to the Uni with Fanny who had chosen to use their walk to press Jackson about her non-existent sex life. "Am I too choosy?" she asked Fanny, realising how sad it must sound to her.<br><br>"You've got Martin," Fanny shot back. But she instantly picked up on Jackson's tight look. "Oh, something up?" Jackson nodded. "Better not to talk about it?" Jackson stared. "Okay, next subject. But don't forget I'm your friend when I'm not writing you up for my next research paper. You can talk to me."<br><br>Jackson murmured her thanks.<br><br>They stopped in the corridor at a nondescript door. "In here," Fanny advised and went in first. There was some sort of vestibule and another room. She continued on as Jackson followed. The inner room had a desk facing the door. Fanny went around and sat down facing the standing Jackson.<br><br>Fanny placed and elbow on the desk and rested her chin on her fist. "So you want to be a mailgirl," she asked Jackson. "Well, let's check that you won't get stage fright or anything. So..."<br><br>"But you left the other door open and there's no lock on this door," Jackson complained.<br><br>"Are you scared that someone will see you? I'm sorry but I think that is the point." Fanny became quite stern with her friend. "Either you can be a mailgirl or you can't."<br><br>Jackson nodded. She stood in the middle of the room and bent down to take off her shoes. But she stopped, stood up and lifted her top over her head. The bra came next. "I don't know why you wear it," Fanny observed. Jackson's smallish firm breasts did not need any support. Fanny even hefted her large breasts, clearly defined even under her various pieces of clothing to suggest a problem which Jackson did not have. Jackson managed to keep from covering her breasts as she stood facing Fanny, trying to look seductive or at least sexy. "You don't have to try to do that," Fanny told her, "you've got it naturally. Now, the job is only half done." Surrendering to the inevitable, Jackson again bend down to step out of her shoes, drop her skirt then roll down her tights. "Oh yeah," she pretended to just realise, "these." And slid her panties down her legs. And like that she was completely bare. Feeling she had to convince Fanny she was comfortable naked, Jackson ran both her hands through her hair to show that she did not need to cover up.<br><br>Sitting at her desk, Fanny picked up a sheet of paper and looked at it. "I need you to run this down to the Dean's office. It's down the corridor, turn left and at the end of that corridor." Fanny held out the sheet to Jackson.<br><br>Jackson reached for the sheet then realising, suddenly recoiled. "Fanny, I can't do that!" she exploded.<br><br>"You're the mailgirl," Fanny tried, as straight of face as she could be.<br><br>"But this is not a mailgirl office," Jackson reminded her.<br><br>"Oh yeah," Fanny feigned to remember. "But tell me how it made you feel?"<br><br>Jackson strode a few paces around Fanny's desk. "I guess I can manage this, so long as the aircon is like this..."<br><br>Before she could continue, someone strode into the office. A male voice rang out, "Fanny were you able to confirm that roster..." and then stopped when he realised that Fanny had company, naked company. He stared at Jackson non-judgementally for a moment, only about a metre away from her. "Sorry," he regrouped, "I didn't realise you were doing mailgirl simulations today." Like it was normal or something. He held out a hand to Jackson. "I'm Brett. Fanny and I run one of the labs."<br><br>"Jackson," she replied accepting the man's handshake as it if were the most normal thing in the world. Although she tried not to look at his face.<br><br>"I'll leave you to it then," he concluded. "I'll come back to discuss it when you're free," he told Fanny. And was gone as quickly as he had come in.<br><br>Fanny smiled at her friend. "How was that?" she tested.<br><br>Jackson smiled back with some sudden confidence. "I didn't have time to get flustered, do anything." She thought for a moment, scratched her chin. "It was easy," she concluded.<br><br>Fanny smiled back carefully, believing that Jackson was most of the way there.<br><br>Excerpt 2 — Jackson knew one of the other mailgirls at Uni.<br><br>Jackson felt a certain inevitability about becoming a mailgirl. Although she had not yet told Mitch that she would agree. She realised that since he had made the offer, she enjoyed the look behind his eyes in their meeting, she could tell he was imagining her without clothes. And she was getting a little turned on at the thought of displaying herself to this handsome man. Of course there was the question of displaying herself to the rest of the office. She would have to work out how to come to terms with that. But her experience with Fanny had helped with that. She could do it.<br><br>After finishing her meeting with Mitch, Jackson was waiting at the lifts to leave. The lift going up stopped at the sixth floor, and a tallish woman with a strong and striking face got out. She looked at Jackson and Jackson looked at her.<br><br>"Don't I know you," the woman blurted just before Jackson could say the same.<br><br>"I was thinking the same thing," Jackson replied as she tried to place her. Jackson was cautious in such situations. Was this office worker also moonlighting as a sex worker, is that where Jackson had seen her, while doing her 'day' job enforcing sex worker rights, meeting the workers, visiting the premises? She looked at the other woman, surmising that she certainly had the figure and demeanour to do it.<br><br>"Lauren Marks," she introduced herself to Jackson.<br><br>"Jackson," she replied.<br><br>Lauryn clicked. "Got it. Uni. Gary and Leigh." Jackson looked none the wiser. "Double date," Lauryn continued, "the two of them best mates, not bad looking either of them. But a bit neanderthal..."<br><br>Jackson remembered. "Oh shit," she laughed. "I haven't thought of them for years. And you also, sorry. What are you doing here?"<br><br>"Business Analyst," Lauryn confided. Then her face widened. "I just remembered." She looked around to make sure that they were alone. "One certain night. We went back to one of their places. They were egging us on, wanted to swap or have an orgy or something."<br><br>It was Jackson's turn to clasp her mouth as she too recalled. "We kissed. Put on a show for the boys. How could I forget that? Sorry." She looked at her friend reunited in a different way. Was she blushing?<br><br>Lauryn giggled. "I'm trying to remember how much of a show we did or did not put on." She gave Jackson a weird look. "Shit." Then she recovered. "What are you doing here?"<br><br>Jackson smiled, hoping for a dramatic reaction. "I'm writing the rules for the mailgirls."<br><br>Lauryn's eyes widened. "You're kidding." She looked around again to ensure that they were still alone. "I've applied," she stage whispered. "Don't know if they'll have me, if I'm what they want."<br><br>Jackson made a big issue of carefully looking Lauryn up and down. "There's no way that they're going to reject you," she told her admiringly. She also now remembered that her session with Lauryn indeed involved a lot more than kissing. Did Lauryn recall them loosening each other's clothes and the fingering? Now she wondered why they had lost touch. Life, presumably, had moved on.<br><br>Jackson sighed inwardly, story of her life. But she kept outwardly bright. "You will be fantastic," she insisted. And she pecked Lauryn on the lips. Why not, she thought, for old times. Taking Lauryn by surprise, she got no pushback. Lauryn let her invade her person like that for a long moment. They finished just before someone walked into the lift lobby and pressed the down button. The lift came almost immediately, before either woman could think of a follow up. Other than the conventional.<br><br>"See you round," Jackson called out to Lauryn, as she stepped towards the lift to leave. Lauryn waved back. See you round indeed, Jackson thought, as she contemplated that she would be coming back to Harada Industries one day very soon to remove her clothes to become a mailgirl there. And no doubt Lauryn would be there with her, naked too. Perhaps it was meant to be.<br><br>Excerpt 3 — Jackson meets with Mr Harada.<br><br>* Jackson has become a mailgirl. Mr Harada is visiting the Melbourne office from Japan.<br><br>Jackson walked into the boardroom for her meeting straight backed, moving like a dancer, you would swear that she was on raised heels, approaching you on her toes. It gave her an air of control. And she was late, by only a few minutes, but enough to know that Mr Harada would already be there, sitting, watching the door, waiting for her.<br><br>Naked and self-assured, Jackson walked up to Mr Harada who stood at the far end of the room, behind the chair at the head of the board table, obviously his place at any meeting he attended in the Melbourne office.<br><br>"Nice to meet you," Jackson smiled at the owner of the company. She held out a hand to let Mr Harada shake it.<br><br>"And I finally meet you," he replied stiffly. "You are the one who wrote the contracts."<br><br>"And made sure that the employment conditions were acceptable to the Fair Work Commission," Jackson added, although Mr Harada showed no reaction to that, as if he was not interested in details such as making sure that the laws of the country were obeyed. He did invite her to sit and once she had, he placed himself in that seat at the top of the board table.<br><br>"You know that I do not approve of all these changes that you made to the mailgirls rules."<br><br>"Which ones? If we did not have employment conditions like this then you would have no mailgirls in this office." Jackson pushed her chair back from the table. She felt that she wanted Mr Harada to see all of her, not just what would be visible if she sat at the table.<br><br>"Mitchell Johnson was weak for accepting these contracts. Did you allure him?"<br><br>"Did I what? No, I only told him what was possible under the law." Jackson leaned back and spread her legs just a little, just giving Mr Harada a hint of what lay between. "And helped him with the drafting."<br><br>Mr Harada affected not to notice the mailgirl's display. "Weak," he repeated staring into Jackson's eyes.<br><br>She stared back. "So you think normal rules shouldn't apply to you?"<br><br>"How do you think I became successful?"<br><br>"Probably a combination of underhand dealings and dumb luck." Jackson had already found that she had a certain amount of freedom, she could be blunt like that, in an office with no clothes on.<br><br>Mr Harada's face showed only calm. "Well, whether or not that is true, it is not important since here I am, no matter how much you choose to look down on me for it."<br><br>"Oh, I don't look down. I admire you for sticking with it. And for making your business a success."<br><br>Mr Harada smiled as if the naked mailgirl sitting there unselfconsciously had made a connection with him. "I am more self-aware than you probably give me credit for. I know that in the West I am everybody's stereotype of what they think a Japanese magnate should be. And you Australians have a habit of saying what you think, even to the boss. Do I care? No! Why? Because I have all the money. I can be who I want, do as I choose."<br><br>Jackson was not going to let him get away with that. "What do you expect mailgirls to be?" she asked although she was sure that she already knew the answer to that.<br><br>Mr Harada shook his head. "I expected better from you, based on the reports I've seen."<br><br>Jackson did not flinch at that. "I wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth. No offence intended." Who had supplied him reports on her, she wondered. And what did they say? She would find that out later.<br><br>"I run a business," Mr Harada started, "not a charity for naked women."<br><br>"Ah, the profit motive."<br><br>"Correct. By incentivising the staff, the mailgirl should improve the productivity of the business and add to the bottom line. The mailgirl can be seen in entirely economic terms."<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "I have questions. Why are there no mailboys? Do you not need to stimulate your female staff as well as the males? And if you see mailgirls in purely economic terms, why do you have your punishment sessions privately in your office at the end of each week? How does that private little peccadillo of yours help the performance of the company?"<br><br>Mr Harada's face darkened. "You! How did you know about that?" he shouted.<br><br>Jackson remained calm. "I too get reports," she smiled. She shifted in her seat. "I'm starting to enjoy this too much. Can you call a mailgirl for me?"<br><br>Mr Harada was about to ask Jackson why she wanted a mailgirl, but he decided he would maintain his dignity and simply do what she asked. He typed into his laptop then looked back to Jackson who slouched forward a little in her seat then crossed, uncrossed and crossed her legs again, finally resting one leg over her knee so that Mr Harada could not quite see her crotch. It reminded him of a movie although he could not recall which one. Jackson smiled at him, knowingly. But what did she know?<br><br>"Your mailgirl should be here in a moment," he told her trying to keep his tone flat and calm. Despite his anger. A mailgirl calling a mailgirl indeed!<br><br>Jackson was again ready to pounce, still in her provocative pose which Mr Harada realised too late made her the interviewer and him the interviewee. "Are you interested at all in the mailgirls' pleasure? And what about the rest of the staff's frustration?" she inquired.<br><br>"What do you mean?" Mr Harada asked. He stood up from his seat at the head of the table to try to claw back some of his authority over the naked worker who had turned the dynamic away from him.<br><br>But Jackson was just starting. "I don't see how this is meant to make the office work. We mailgirls are some sort of unattainable object of desire. I mean I get that your Japanese mailgirls are selected to be submissive and that the US mailgirls have this interesting relationship with freedom and boundaries. I get that there are mailgirls who thrive in those sort of situations. But you'll have to convince me how all that makes an office operate more productively than if everyone had kept their clothes on."<br><br>Mr Harada smiled. "I barely noticed you were nude," he stated.<br><br>Jackson laughed then crossed, uncrossed and crossed her legs again. "I thought that would be pretty hard. What, are you getting old?" she challenged.<br><br>At that moment the mailgirl Lauryn Mark knocked on the meeting room's door and was invited in. The slender, serious faced mailgirl showed her surprise to see the two of them in there, Jackson sitting calm with an air of control while the man she recognised as the company owner stood agitated a distance away from them. Typical Jackson, she thought.<br><br>Jackson called Lauren over and quietly asked her to grab a Lush and a dildo from the dildo station. Lauryn looked to Mr Harada who said nothing and made no gesture so she smiled at Jackson and left the room.<br><br>Mr Harada picked up where the conversation had paused. "I did not notice because you gaijin do nothing for me."<br><br>Jackson smiled. "Not submissive enough?"<br><br>Mr Harada chose to play along. "Not smooth skinned, light moving..."<br><br>"Delicate?" Jackson wondered.<br><br>Mr Harada thought about that for a moment. "Perhaps. And the inherent neatness of our girls."<br><br>Jackson was about to get defensive about that when Lauryn again knocked on the door and entered carrying the items that Jackson had requested. Smiling at Mr Harada who stood there watching, looking angry and stressed, she handed Jackson the dildo but held onto the large pink sperm-like Lush. Lauryn then sat down next to Jackson to check the device. "Just making sure you've got the bluetooth working," she told the other naked mailgirl. She pressed the screen and held the Lush to Jackson's cheek to show that it was throbbing as it should. The mailgirls smiled at each other. Jackson gripped the dildo, holding it to her lips for a moment, making sure that Mr Harada was watching.<br><br>Lauryn still held the Lush. She smiled at her friend. "Do you want me to?" she asked with a smile as she pointed the item towards Jackson's open legs.<br><br>"If you could," Jackson smiled back, so Lauryn carefully inserted it. She kept her hands on Jackson's pussy longer than she probably needed to, apparently making sure the Lush was doing what it was meant to. She eased the bulb into Jackson's pussy with the antenna poking out between her lips.<br><br>Jackson felt a gentle buzz and closed her eyes for a moment to savour the sensation then thanked Lauryn in a way that suggested she should leave her and Mr Harada alone alone. Agreeable to that, Lauryn removed her hands from her friend then wriggled her bottom at Mr Harada as she left the room. She had been there a short moment giving the boss no time to react, only to stand and watch.<br><br>Alone again with Mr Harada, Jackson then removed the Lush and placed it and the dildo on the boardroom table, as if she had no idea what the two toys were doing there. Jackson continued their interrupted conversation. "Your girls? The mailgirls in Japan? Are you speaking generally or just about the ones that go to your office after hours?" she probed.<br><br>Mr Harada did not seem to read her jab at him. "We have very particular selection processes," he told her.<br><br>Jackson fingered the dildo as if she had just realised its shape and what it was for. "I bet you do," she retorted. "Very particular, I'm sure. But that's just fear of the unknown, isn't it? I expected more of you. A more worldly view." She held the dildo in one hand and wanked it towards her mouth with the other.<br><br>Mr Harada still seemed not to be affected by Jackson's performance. "Maybe I have my prejudices," he agreed.<br><br>"And so the fear that if you let your penis anywhere near me you might catch something nasty..." Jackson wondered.<br><br>Mr Harada smiled at the mailgirl. "I was going to say that I did not notice you nude because I am more interested in your mind and your ideas."<br><br>Jackson acted surprised. "Really?" she asked.<br><br>Mr Harada crossed his arms. "Like your preference for collective bargaining."<br><br>Jackson smiled back. "Ah, I see. So as you know, all the mailgirls here get the same pay. I dread to think what happens in Japan."<br><br>Mr Harada bristled at that. "I am aware of that, since I pay the bills. You may not realise from your position, but I know everything that goes on. It is my company."<br><br>Jackson's position was sucking on the dildo. She also re-inserted the Lush in her pussy. She spread her legs, her feet up on the table as she slouched back in her chair. She did the next obvious thing, took the dildo slowly out of her mouth and with a private groan, inserted it into her pussy alongside the Lush.<br><br>Mr Harada affected not to be at all interested in what she was doing. "All the conditions you negotiated," he continued. "And whatever 'the superannuation contribution' is."<br><br>Jackson stopped her stimulation for a moment. "It's a compulsory levy for our retirement funds," she informed Mr Harada.<br><br>"And you negotiated a higher rate for that than the minimum percentage." He smiled. So he did know.<br><br>Jackson nodded, holding the dildo at the entrance to her pussy while she parried with the company owner. "It was agreed in the negotiations," she stated. "Women traditionally have lower retirement balances than men. So we thought we should do something about that." And she slid the dildo back in.<br><br>"Your skills at negotiations should never be doubted," Mr Harada noted as Jackson's eyes widened, she made an O with her mouth. She was now pumping the dildo in and out with intent. Still Mr Harada continued. "And I am aware that you negotiated a base salary for all the mailgirls that is somewhat higher than what any of them were earning than before."<br><br>The naked mailgirl nodded back then smiled at the man who had stepped closer to her. She stopped her thrusting again to explain her actions. "Well, since I know what women in the profession here get paid for taking their clothes off. I know what this is worth." Clearly referring to the show she was putting on for the boss. She pressed the dildo deep in and then removed it, lightly running the head around her opening. She looked seriously at Mr Harada. "But you still haven't told me what the mailgirls in Japan get paid?" she reminded him. But she knew that he would not give her that answer.<br><br>Excerpt 4 — Jackson visits the HR Department.<br><br>* Before her first contract ended, Mitchell Johnson talked Jackson into signing on for another twelve months.<br><br>Jackson wandered through the HR Department the day after she had signed her mailgirl contract extension. She was looking for someone named Martin in HR to give him a message. She went up to one of the HR people she knew, noting by now just how unremarkable it was that they did not bat an eyelid that she was wandering the floor totally naked. She interrupted a worker close to the entrance to ask for Martin. They directed her to a desk near the back of the office where a pretty but not stunning woman sat, concentrating hard on whatever was on her screen. Jackson thought she was exactly the sort of woman you would expect to find in an office. A normal office. As Jackson got closer, she noted that the woman was about the same age as she was.<br><br>"You're not Martin?" Jackson asked wryly, breaking the woman out of her concentration.<br><br>She looked up, clearly shocked to find that she was staring at Jackson's naked crotch. "I'm... I'm not... I'm June Lockhart," the woman stammered, still flustered. "You're a..."<br><br>"Yes, I am," Jackson smiled. How glad she was to find someone in the office she could still shock after all this time. Jackson pinched one of her nipples, to keep the torment brewing. "So clearly you're not Martin," she repeated, smiling at her victim.<br><br>"Martin sits there," June pointed to empty seat across from her. "He had to pop out." Jackson nodded as June prattled on. "I've done the course and everything. But still it didn't, I'm sorry, prepare me for unexpected..." And she looked away from Jackson's crotch.<br><br>"That's all right," Jackson assured June, "believe me that's one of the better responses I've heard since I've been here. Are you expecting Martin back?" She sensed that June wanted her to just leave. But well, she had mailgirl business. And she was in no hurry. And their conversation meant that June had to maintain eye contact with her. Jackson realised, for the first time, that she enjoyed being stared at, examined, her body an object of desire. This was unexpected and new to her, but not at all unwelcome. She privately admitted that she liked it.<br><br>"He should be a few minutes," June hoped. Jackson noted that although she was still clearly flustered, this HR staffer was finding it hard to look away from her and was now clearly checking her over.<br><br>"You don't mind if I wait," Jackson asked her, still pinching her nipple. This was fun.<br><br>"No, no, stand, sit, whatever you feel more comfortable..." June spilt out, still not quite on top of her emotions.<br><br>"Thanks, I'll stand," Jackson decided, feeling just playful enough not to remove herself from their close proximity. According to the rules, mailgirls could do that. They held all the cards. Jackson sidled up close and leaned over, balancing one hand on June's desk, her breasts close to June's face. Jackson looked down at her, interested. "Have you been here long? I don't think I've seen you before and I'm up here quite a lot."<br><br>"I've only been here a short time." June tried to show some gumption. "I've seen the mailgirls come in here and go into the boss's office, I guess that must have been you, mostly called by the bosses. But that is over the other side of the office. We're kind of out of the way here. Martin and I deal with the temporary staff."<br><br>"Oh, I'm temporary, you can deal with me," Jackson replied slyly. Trying to break the ice.<br><br>June smiled and relaxed a little. "I deal with the temps who keep their clothes on," she smiled.<br><br>"I'll keep that in mind," Jackson smiled back as she stood up straight to stretch her arms. Which meant that, completely exposed, her tight bust shimmied just a little.<br><br>"I was wondering... "June started. She asked the question that so many asked first up. "How did you become a mailgirl?"<br><br>Jackson had her clever answer ready. "Anyone can become a mailgirl. You certainly could."<br><br>"Oh no," June complained, "I couldn't possibly do what you do. And you're so much... you know, you look like a mailgirl."<br><br>Jackson smiled broadly. "I'll take that as a compliment. But you are far more attractive than me." Jackson took the opportunity to look June over more closely. She was a little chubby but that gave her curves. And her short, slightly turned up nose gave her round face an openness together with her large, currently uncomprehending eyes. Jackson could imagine her naked around the office.<br><br>June couldn't. "That may be the case, I don't know. But I couldn't spend all day in the office naked. With everyone looking at me. I really admire you for doing that."<br><br>Jackson realised. "You weren't here of course when the invitations came out to show interest in the scheme. So you never saw the email." And she felt a pang, a little amount of concern. Was she going to judge the other women in office by whether they were prepared to take their clothes off?<br><br>June looked surprised. "I would have deleted mine from the email straight away. That way I wouldn't torture myself about whether or not I should even be thinking about doing something that I would never do. I'm not a prude. It's just..."<br><br>"Extreme?"Jackson suggested. Something about this interaction gave her a thrill. Was she getting turned on? She thought about giving herself a gentle tug. But she sensed any overt sexual action might drive June away. And something was going on between them. But where was Martin?<br><br>June thought for a moment. "Extreme? Maybe. Yeah. Easier not to think about doing it."<br><br>Jackson instinctively opened her legs and spread her arms dramatically. "You can think. But see, it can be done. Here I am."<br><br>"Here you are," muttered June. Jackson allowed some silence between them for a moment. Finally June, nervously asked "How do you do it?"<br><br>Jackson place her hands on her hips. "You come to work each day and take your clothes off."<br><br>June shook her head. "You know that's not what I mean. How did you go from well dressed career girl..."<br><br>Jackson continued. "...to undressed career girl? Are you up for a bit of a story?<br><br>June smiled. "Okay."<br><br>Jackson swivelled her hips suggestively. "It's a long story. Maybe over drinks some time."<br><br>"You're not trying to hit on me," June worried. She tried to read Jackson's brazen stance. And the challenging look on her face. "I'm not a lesbian," June complained.<br><br>Jackson laughed. "You wanted my story. I just pointed out that it will take some time to tell. And your apparently mythical friend might return any moment." Jackson studied the woman who suddenly seemed appealing to her in a wholesome looking for desecration sort of way.<br><br>June must have picked up Jackson's wavelength. "You wouldn't do anything to me would you?" she worried.<br><br>Jackson looked appropriately shocked. "Why would you think something like that? I would not do anything that you did not want me to do. If you want to talk, we talk."<br><br>June had more issues. "And you would have clothes on?"<br><br>Jackson was concerned about this direction. "Look, I only dress like this for work. If you are concerned about these things we don't have to do it."<br><br>June backtracked severely. "I sorry. I don't know. But I am genuinely interested. If I wasn't interested in people, I wouldn't be in HR."<br><br>Jackson thought of an obvious and cruel rejoinder to that, but decided to bite her lip.<br><br>June decided that she should fill the silence between them. "You may not realise it from your position in the office, but I get rather nervous in the office around you naked mailgirls. Just the thought. I guess that's why I wanted to understand you."<br><br>Jackson eased a little way back from her encroachment. "I'm sorry, it will seem strange to you but I'm used to this." She gestured again to show off her body. And saw an insecure looking man in an ill-fitting shirt and skewed tie, heading their way. She looked to June. "Right on cue," to which June nodded.<br><br>Martin looked at Jackson like he had won a prize. "You have a message?" she asked him as he sat down awkwardly in his seat. "I hope it wasn't urgent?"<br><br>Having sat, he stared silently at the nude woman in front of him. "Martin," June ordered him, "you've kept her waiting."<br><br>"Oh yes," he stammered. "I need the casuals' timesheets from the stockroom. Email reminders, phone calls don't work. And when I went down there they fobbed me off." Jackson raised an eyebrow. "I thought..." he trailed off.<br><br>"...they may respond better to a naked woman?" Jackson offered more assertively than Martin seemed capable of. "Well, let's put that to the test. Give me the details."<br><br>When that was done, just as she was about to leave, Jackson went back around to June. "Send me an email," she smiled and then turned dramatically to stride out of the office, her head held high having decided to put a bit of drama into her position. Jackson was now confident about all her assets and how to be best proud of them. She looked at the dildo station near the entrance to HR for a moment. Sure she felt a buzz in her groin from her confidence. But not quite enough to turn it into something bigger with one of the toys on the table.<br><br>"What was that about?" Martin asked June cautiously once Jackson was out of sight.<br><br>She shrugged it off. "Girls talk," she responded brusquely and went back to her work.<br><br>"Are you thinking of becoming a mailgirl?" he asked with what he thought was just the right amount of interest in his co-worker's aspirations.<br><br>June smiled back at him. "Of course not. I couldn't do that. And I'm perfectly happy here in HR." But she knew that her reply had been a bit too definite.<br><br>Excerpt 5 — Jackson makes a friend of the Business Analyst Michael.<br><br>Jackson exited the stairwell at level 8 and stood at the door for a moment alone and unsure. She checked her app, checked the number affixed to the door and assured herself that she was on the right floor. She faced a white wall with no signage and could hear nothing. She decided to follow a narrow walkway to her left. This led her around a corner to where she found the open plan with a number of desks all of which seemed empty. She stood at the entrance to the area checking the room until she realised that one desk was occupied. A man was concentrating on his screen, his back to her. She checked the app again and with no other alternative, she stepped cautiously towards him. She was used to being a mailgirl in a busy office, she was used to being a mailgirl with people she knew like Mitch. She was not used to being on her own with one other employee, especially one she did not know. She was on her guard.<br><br>The man worked at his screen oblivious to her approach. Jackson suspected that he was not expecting a mailgirl. Or had he forgotten he had called one, maybe it was of so little importance to him?<br><br>Jackson felt a bit naughty and not expecting to get caught she gripped one of her nipples and then pinched the other one as she stood a desk away from the man. She stroked her labia and found that while she felt daring for doing it, she was not turned on. Remembering that she was on the clock, Jackson stepped closer and coughed. The man turned around.<br><br>"You're naked," he spluttered.<br><br>Jackson felt back in control. "Yes," she explained, "I'm one of them."<br><br>"Ah, oh," he stammered.<br><br>"I'm here because you called me to deliver a message."<br><br>The man tried to stop looking at her breasts. He failed. "I, um, didn't call one..." he stammered.<br><br>Jackson studied her app. "You're Jason?"<br><br>The man relaxed. "I'm Michael. Jason is at lunch with everyone else. I thought I'd get some work done while they were out. I need to finish this." He pointed at the screen.<br><br>"Ah, er. So?" Jackson wondered.<br><br>"Either Jason called you and forgot. Or he thought he'd do this to me."<br><br>Am I the only one that this keeps happening to, Jackson wondered. She sighed and decided she should be agreeable. "It's not so bad," she suggested.<br><br>"And I'm almost finished." Michael saved what he was working on then turned to give Jackson his polite attention. They could both sense that he was not sure where to look. He settled on glancing past her shoulder. He gripped his desk. "So tell me," he asked, "I did the training but didn't read the email. What are we supposed to do?"<br><br>Jackson shrugged. "Uh, talk?" She noticed that he had relaxed a little so she continued. "What do you do in here? I haven't been on this floor before."<br><br>"So you're new to here?" he asked, kind of unnecessarily. Jackson nodded. "This is the business analyst department," Michael explained, "we lost Lauryn Marks to you. Do you know her?"<br><br>"There's only six of us, so yes I know her," Jackson replied. Otherwise she could give him Lauryn's entire history with her, just for the shock value. Better not.<br><br>"Ah, you must be the one who didn't work here before? Have you got used to this sort of work?" He had become surprisingly confident with Jackson, given his initial fluster.<br><br>Jackson shook her head. "I'm a union organiser."<br><br>"What are you doing here?" Michael asked. No longer even a little nervous.<br><br>"Getting my thrills," Jackson smiled. She changed her stance, stood at ease, with her hands behind her back and her crotch on display.<br><br>Michael did not seem concerned about that. "Seriously?" he asked.<br><br>"Actually yes." They both smiled. "If you read the rules, you'd know I'm allowed to pleasure myself and invite you to help me get off."<br><br>"Get off?"<br><br>"Have an orgasm. You really haven't got this mailgirls thing yet, have you?"<br><br>"Well I thought I told you, it's a bit of a change."<br><br>"But you've seen the videos?"<br><br>Michael shook his head. "I hadn't even heard of mailgirls until the office announcement."<br><br>"You've been living under a rock?"<br><br>"No, I just don't get off on fantasies about my workplace." He thought for a moment. "Well at least I didn't. I guess that all changes now." He looked her up and down, her firm breasts, prominent lips and slender legs.<br><br>Jackson let his ogling go uncommented. After all, she had brought that on herself. "In that case, what are your fantasies?" she asked him since he had suggested that she was not one of them.<br><br>"Since we have mailgirls, I have to wonder how their service can make my working day easier."<br><br>"That's what we're here for," Jackson offered lightly.<br><br>Michael shook his head. "Not like that. I had a perfectly healthy sex life before this started. Now I have to worry whether or not I should get turned on when I see my former colleague..." He gestured at the empty desk facing his. "...naked whether I am supposed to get turned on. Or as you hinted, maybe help her out if she needs something. That minefield has just become more dangerous."<br><br>Jackson thought for a moment and gave him a penetrating look. "Have you tried talking to her about it?" she asked.<br><br>Jackson hoped that she had got her tone right. That she was not too threatening. She never realised how easy it was to be assertive when naked, a mailgirl exposed in an office that was mostly dressed. Free to speak her mind and be quite straightforward with the fabrics. That was something she had not expected.<br><br>`
