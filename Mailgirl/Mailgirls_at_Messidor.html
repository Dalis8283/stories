      ‚ÄúShit‚Äù I thought as I went through the doors of Building G and into HR reception . 20 or 30 people sitting or standing around, most of my age and some I knew from school. One of the boys saw me and waved, I went over and sat down.<br><br>‚ÄúHi Alice, I thought you were going to University?‚Äù he said<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve deferred for a year, want to earn some money and maybe travel a bit next year. How about you?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGrades not good enough for Uni but need a job so Messidor seemed the obvious start point, seems like a lot of us thought the same,‚Äù he said, gesturing around.<br><br>Rather rapidly the number of people in the waiting area diminished, then they called my name. I stood up, smoothed down the dress I was wearing and went into the interview. There were two people in the room, as I walked in one of them, a woman, studied me very carefully. The other, a man, examined the papers on his desk.<br><br>I was surprised by this. Usually, it‚Äôs the men that pay attention to me.<br><br>The interview seemed to go well. I answered all of the interviewers questions smoothly. They asked about Uni and I was completely open about my deferral and my need to work to build up some money. I told them my father had left us years ago and my mother didn‚Äôt have a good job.<br><br>As a statement that was true, albeit a little misleading. My mother was permanently ‚Äúunder the doctor‚Äù, as people say. Her persistent illnesses took up much of her time, we usually lived on benefits and, if she had a job, it was always temporary or zero hours.<br><br>At the end, the interviewers had a quick, whispered discussion. The woman spoke up.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice we won‚Äôt be offering you a job as an admin assistant here. We had a rather different employee profile in mind for that job. We are looking for people who will become loyal, long term Messidor employees. Your desire to go to University rather cuts across that.‚Äù<br><br>I must have looked disappointed. The man stepped in.<br><br>‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre local to us here and, we like to help young people, it is part of our corporate mission.‚Äù He said a bit pompously.<br><br>The woman continued.<br><br>‚ÄúWe may have something for you in a different role here at head office. Would you be interested?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOf course‚Äù I shot back, I didn‚Äôt care what job I took, at least that‚Äôs what I thought at that moment. I just needed something to pay me some money.<br><br>‚ÄúIf you wouldn‚Äôt mind waiting outside for a few minutes I will take you to see one of our managers.‚Äù She said<br><br>I sat outside in the waiting room and wondered. I looked around. The room was bland, there were Messidor posters in frames around the room. I was a bit upset about the admin job, although only because it was a simple way to earn some money. The job itself was of no interest.<br><br>Messidor was, and still is, the largest local employer. Their huge campus spreads over land just outside the town. Everything for their retail operation is run from the campus. My father used to work on the campus before he ran off with his secretary.<br><br>I looked around the now empty waiting room and wondered what the other position was.<br><br>The lady who had interviewed me came along after a few minutes, I followed her out of the big building near the gates where the interview had taken place and we walked away from the entrance. From outside the campus all that can be seen easily are the two large, fairly standard, office blocks, one of which I had been in. Further back the buildings were arranged in a rough V shape, all of them modern, with a lot of glass. They all had a different look but all clearly belonged to the same architectural family.<br><br>It was hot outside but walking up the slight hill was relaxing, a bit like walking through a park.<br><br>We went into the first building on the right. The buildings back here were smaller than the one we had just been in. There were no roads to be seen. The owner of Messidor, John Vaux, was a keen environmentalist and encouraged his staff to walk or ride bicycles. Paved paths and what looked like nature trails criss crossed the campus, there were a lot of trees .The sun made the whole area look very inviting.<br><br>We got in the lift went up to the sixth floor.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice, please come in.‚Äù<br><br>A tall slim and elegant woman wearing a rather strange neck band had opened the door into a large office. She had long cascading blonde hair and was dressed in corporate smart clothes, a white blouse, jacket and skirt to her knees.<br><br>‚ÄúMy name is Jackie Whitten, do sit down.‚Äù<br><br>She pulled up a chair and sat next to me on my side of the desk. There was a low table to one side. She had a folder in her hand although she didn‚Äôt seem to need to refer to it.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told about your earlier interview. I think we might have something that would serve your purpose although it is a little radical‚Äù<br><br>She gazed out of the window.<br><br>‚ÄúI see you live in Elmdon Close‚Äù I nodded ‚ÄúOne of my team lives there, do you know Emma Broughton?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOf course‚Äù I said ‚Äúshe lives two doors down from me‚Äù<br><br>Emma was the subject of much discussion in our Close. She was in her twenties, married although her husband had disappeared. She had started working at Messidor a few months ago and obviously had an excellent job because very quickly she had ordered new furniture, replaced her car and apparently paid off her debts. I liked Emma although my mother was catty about her. Emma never told me what her job was.<br><br>‚ÄúDo you know what Emma does?‚Äù she asked, looking at me closely.<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>‚ÄúDo you know about Mail Girls?‚Äù she asked.<br><br>My stomach did a lurch. I had read articles about Mail Girls. I‚Äôd played the computer game.<br><br>‚ÄúEmma is one of our mail girls, although officially her job description is Communications Associate‚Äù she paused and looked into my eyes, ‚ÄúI think you would be fantastic for that role.‚Äù<br><br>Time seemed to stop.<br><br>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you had mail girls here‚Äù I stuttered, as something to say while my head was reeling.<br><br>She nodded and went on.<br><br>‚ÄúTheir business efficacy is well established, and with the Brexit decisions companies are freed of Euro bureaucracy. Messidor and some other companies have been permitted to operate mail girls. We would offer you a signing bonus, generous pay and the company would help you through University. We would expect you to work for us when on vacation and other occasions, provided it didn‚Äôt interfere with your studies‚Äù<br><br>I stared at her.<br><br>She handed me a short document setting out the terms. I looked down, my eyes must have opened up at the amount of money on offer. My heart was pumping. I needed to calm down.<br><br>‚ÄúYou can see it is a generous package, take your time and read it all‚Äù I nodded enthusiastically, it was a lot of money.<br><br>‚ÄúIf you are interested‚Äù she looked at me ‚Äúwe need to see if you are qualified to be a communications assistant. Are you interested?‚Äù<br><br>I nodded involuntarily, this was happening so fast. The money was definitely interesting but the idea of running naked around these offices was a very different thing. I wondered what the qualifications would be.<br><br>The thing was, within the last month, I‚Äôd been to stay with a cousin. She was my age, I‚Äôd always got on well with her. She had the Mailgirl computer game and we‚Äôd played it pretty obsessively. We‚Äôd talked about the idea of being naked with clothed people watching us. I‚Äôd found it all something of a turn on. Because I wasn't a schoolgirl anymore, I‚Äôd also started sleeping naked.<br><br>I‚Äôd had the odd wank thinking of what it would be like to run around naked.<br><br>But all of that had been in my cousin‚Äôs bedroom or mine.<br><br>Jackie stood up and walked back around to the other side of the desk.<br><br>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre interested, please take off all of your clothes‚Äù she ordered.<br><br>Time stopped. I‚Äôd started calming down but now my heart went into overdrive. I later understood that this was the killer moment in the interview. If a girl won‚Äôt do it, seems excessively awkward or whatever, she will never be a mail girl.<br><br>Now I was not brought up to be a prude. I had lost my virginity in a clumsy, almost entirely clothed, encounter in the back seat of a car. I didn‚Äôt have a boyfriend but I had ...ed a male friend on a few occasions. I had never been totally naked with him .<br><br>I stood up. Three thoughts rattled around my brain.<br><br>What would my mother say?<br>It was a lot of money.<br>The idea of being naked turned me on a little.<br><br>I pulled the dress over my head. Jackie had now sat down on the other side of the desk and watched, rather clinically. I undid my bra and let it drop to the floor. I have reasonable boobs. Not terribly big but nice and firm and big enough; nobody has ever called me flat chested.<br><br>Jackie looked at me expectantly. Oh well, in for a penny, I thought and I pulled off my panties.<br><br>Jackie smiled a beaming smile and said ‚ÄúVery good‚Äù I stood somewhat awkwardly with my hands fluttering over my pubes and my boobs.<br><br>‚ÄòHands behind your back please Alice.‚Äù She came back around her desk and started looking at me as if I were an exhibit. She stood right in front of me and gently lifted both of my boobs. I was shocked.<br><br>‚ÄúNice and firm, what I would expect from an eighteen year old‚Äù<br><br>She bent down and studied my pubes.<br><br>‚ÄúNeed to get rid of that landing strip Alice, feet slightly apart please‚Äù<br><br>This was all too much for me. On one hand this medical type inspection was outrageous, on the other I was massively turned on by someone just looking at me in detail.<br><br>‚ÄúI see your labia protrude slightly from your vulva‚Äù she said<br>‚ÄúI not sure that is very attractive‚Äù I heard myself croak.<br>‚ÄúOh you are quite wrong there,‚Äù she laughed ‚Äúvery nice‚Äù<br><br>She disappeared behind me, felt my bum and slightly parted my cheeks. I could feel myself getting moist, turned on. I imagined her looking at my anus.<br><br>‚ÄúVery good. You are well qualified, as I thought. I am prepared to let you enter our training programme‚Äù she paused ‚Äúthat is if you are still interested.‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>She had gone back to her seat behind the desk leaving me naked standing in front of her. She picked up a pen and looked down at her papers.<br><br>I was confused, she was acting as if I had applied for this job. An hour ago I‚Äôd come here for a job as a boring admin assistant and now I was standing stark naked in a corporate office with a woman who seemed to treat my nudity as normal behaviour.<br><br>Out the window I could see up toward the point of the V, the building I soon knew was A. On her wall was a picture of a sea shore that had a Japanese feel to it.<br><br>‚ÄúTraining takes up to a maximum of two weeks, usually quicker if you take to the work. It isn‚Äôt complicated but the uniform ‚Äúshe smiled‚Äù can be, er, challenging. At the end we meet again and I decide whether you are suited to the job.‚Äù She smiled at me ‚ÄúYou can back out at that stage. We‚Äôll pay you our standard minimum wage for that period. If we both decide to go ahead then you sign the contract, and you become one of the Messidor Mail Girls, pay back dated to your start date‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhen would I start‚Äù I heard myself say.<br>‚ÄúToo late for this week so next Monday‚Äù she smiled ‚Äúdo I take it you are interested?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù I said.<br><br>I seemed to be answering on autopilot. My emotional brain had taken over; this sounded fun. Intellectually I was trying to analyse my reactions. I was agreeing to start running naked around the Messidor office complex. I remembered the line from the Frank Turner song ‚Äúno-one gets remembered, from the things they didn‚Äôt do‚Äù I was excited. My nipples had hardened. I was nodding.<br><br>‚ÄúGood, give me a second, and I‚Äôll get the introductory material for you, stay there‚Äù she went out of her office into the outer area leaving the door open. A conversation took place and I looked round. A man in chinos and a polo shirt was talking to Jackie but studying me over her shoulder. For a moment I moved to cover up then stopped and stood up straight again. OK, I‚Äôd taken my clothes off, my decision, if you want to look then get an eyeful.<br><br>Jackie came back in with a corporate style pack. ‚ÄúRead this carefully. The uniform‚Äù she smiled ‚Äúor lack of it, is surprisingly detailed, we will inspect you on arrival next Monday. Being a Mail Girl is a physical job, you appear to be a fit young lady, your CV says you go to the gym regularly. I hope that is true. One thing you could do over this next week is to get used to moving about naked. Trust me, running naked is different, try it.‚Äù<br><br>She smiled at me.<br><br>‚ÄúYou can get dressed if you want, I don't recommend going home nude‚Äù<br><br>I was wondering how to explain this to my mother.<br><br>‚ÄúNext Monday present yourself to the security guard at the main gate at 8.00 and he will direct you. For fairly obvious reasons don‚Äôt bring much and wear as little as you can for decency outside the campus‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI cycle most places‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, you can park your bike up at the work location‚Äù she gestured outside ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see you next week I hope.‚Äù<br><br>She looked down and started working on some papers. I quickly pulled on the dress and not bothering with the underwear I stuffed my pants and bra in my small rucksack.

      I got home still surprised at my decision. Somehow my impulsive agreement made me excited; I knew that sensibly I had gone ahead way too fast.<br><br>But, hey, I hadn‚Äôt committed to anything. I could just tell them tomorrow to forget it. And the money was not just good, it was awesome. I also remembered those horror stories in the press about students stripping, linking up with sugar daddies or actually being prostitutes to pay for their education. None of that would happen to me; I knew that Mail Girls could not be touched in the workplace, that much I did remember.<br><br>Mum wasn‚Äôt in. There was a note on the kitchen worktop. She had gone to her sisters, a trip that normally involved the pub and a late return. Oh well, might as well get going on the prep I thought. I went up into my bedroom and for the second time in the day got naked. I spent much longer than normal looking at myself in the mirror.<br><br>My hair was straight on top with a centre parting and cascaded down around my face in ringlets. I was slim. Nicely rounded boobs with small pink nipples. My hipbones protruded slightly leading the eye down to a clear mons veneris. I had good legs; long thighs. I did look good, I knew that, but I was so happy I had passed Jackie‚Äôs detailed up close inspection.<br><br>I got the manual, sat naked on the bed and started reading. Up to now my knowledge of the Mail Girl phenomenon was based on the computer game and shock horror press stuff. On youtube there were various, in the game, movies made of high scoring runs achieved by players. I was fascinated by the sight of Mailgirl 9, who was just gorgeous, running around the office block. That was going to be me, if I wanted it.<br><br>I did.<br><br>The uniform was detailed. No body hair below the shoulders, no stubble down there. Very subtle makeup. I would be allowed some simple face stuff but minimal lipstick and eyeshadow. No nail varnish. Hair not covering boobs.<br><br>I went into the bathroom and got out my lady shaver. Obvious first thing were the pubes. I‚Äôd never gone bald before, embarrassed by my protruding lips. Jackie must have like them so I told myself, confidence required. I sat on the edge of the bath and started shaving. Some of it was easy, but around my vulva I had to go careful, the tugging around of everything turned me on.<br><br>Underarm not a problem.<br><br>I needed some body lotion I decided. It was warm outside, Jackie had said to wear as little as was decent. I had been dressed in a flighty summer dress so I put that back on with sandals and no underwear, and went out. Simple pleasures. The air flowed around my pussy under the dress; it was very nice. My boobs jiggled away. Nobody seemed to notice.<br><br>Back in the house and naked again I gave my body a good oiling.<br><br>By the end of the day I had read the manual through twice. I made myself a couple of lists.<br><br>First, things to be worried about. I was hoping that by writing them down I would stop worrying.<br><br>1. The first thing in the morning shower and shave at Messidor. All girls were expected to shower and shave on arrival. Then the same thing at lunch and maybe on other occasions. The whole process was on camera and available on the internet in the top level buildings. The idea of repeating the tugging around of my parts on camera for a load of executives was more than a little troubling. But it was also exciting.<br><br>2. Speed. I would be under the cosh almost all the time to get packages from A to B. The Mailgirl Management Unit linked to the central Messidor computer would time me and record de-merits if I were late. It appeared that de-merits meant extra hours, although the manual was not clear.<br><br>Second, things to wonder about.<br><br>1. Being naked all day in front of clothed strangers. Oh ..., I suddenly thought, what if they weren‚Äôt strangers. Some of the employees would live near me. Generally though the ‚Äòlook but don‚Äôt touch‚Äô rules were a hell of an exciting prospect.<br><br>2. Running all day naked was exciting, but could I actually do it?<br><br>Thirdly, good things<br><br>1. Money.<br><br>2. Doing a job that wasn‚Äôt boring.<br><br>Mum came in early evening. She was lightly pissed.<br><br>‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you wearing anything?‚Äù she said<br><br>‚ÄúOh, its nothing you haven‚Äôt seen before and it is hot‚Äù<br><br>She looked suspiciously at me.<br><br>‚ÄúHow did the job interview go?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúGood, I‚Äôve got a job offer. Need to do a couple of weeks training, starting next Monday‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat is it you are doing?‚Äù<br><br>OK, here we go, do I tell her or not?<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a Communications Associate‚Äù<br><br>She exploded.<br><br>‚ÄúYou are ...ing stupid young lady. You‚Äôre going to be a Mail Girl like that Emma next door but one. She told me that she was a communication whatever but I know she runs around that place stark naked. You are absolutely not doing that my girl‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI am, I want to try‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about that‚Äù She was shouting at the top of her voice.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm 18, I can do what I want‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou can ...ing move out then‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her, she was very angry, and I could see why. The move out threat was empty, and we both knew it. If I moved out the money from my father would be reduced, if not stopped. She couldn‚Äôt risk that.<br><br>I reached into my pack of information and gave her the money sheet. She looked at it as if it was written in a foreign language.<br><br>‚ÄúMum, the top number is my signing on bonus. I get it cash at the end of the first month. We could pay off your credit cards and have loads left over.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat credit cards?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThe ones you don‚Äôt talk about, the ones with the statements you hide‚Äù I smiled at her ‚Äúand then you can see how much I get paid per month‚Äù<br><br>She sat down with a plonk at the table.<br><br>‚ÄúYou were going to University and now your just going to run around with men looking at your naked body. What will I tell my friends.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúMum, they will pay me at Uni provided I work for them on vacations etc.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou could get other jobs.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThat pay that much, I don‚Äôt think so. If I don‚Äôt like it after the training I can just walk away. I can do that at any time for the next fortnight.‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice, I‚Äôm worried that you will like it, that you‚Äôll stick it out. Emma thinks it is wonderful.‚Äù<br><br>She got up and went into her room, slamming the door and leaving me in the kitchen.<br><br>I had been thinking about the running. I could obviously run anytime in running gear but running naked would be massively different. One of my standard routes was around a local wild park. It was open all the time and usually deserted at night. Local lads found it all a bit hard work to get around the hills and instead went to a nearby level green surrounded by houses. The park was close by, across a reasonably busy road.<br><br>Later in the evening I went upstairs and put on my trainers, some shorts and a tee shirt. Then shouting out to Mum that I was going out for a run I set off. Crossing the road in running gear was no problem. I headed up my favourite path until I got to a deserted and abandoned park hut about 300 metres in. I went around the back of the hut and listened. There were no other sounds apart from my breathing. I must have stood there for a good few minutes until I was totally satisfied I was alone.<br><br>Quickly I pulled the shorts down and took the shirt off. Now I was standing naked in a public park, albeit in the dark. My heart was pumping; somehow I expected something to happen but apart from feeling excited nothing happened.<br><br>I set off on my run. The first impression was good, the flow of air over all of my body was delightful. Without clothes I ran very much better with smoothness. My boobs bouncing were an issue, obviously something to get used to, but this was fun. The harder I ran the better it got, my parts began to tingle and moistened with the exercise, rather like they had at school when running hard and worrying about the lap time.<br><br>I reached the peak of the run and stopped looking out over the town. The Messidor campus glowed in the dark to my right. I wondered If any Mail Girls were working. As my heart slowed down and I got my breath back I was more aware of my parts. I ran my finger along my vag feeling some wetness. I tickled my clit and thought about masturbating there but stopped, worried if someone came, apart from me of course.<br><br>Down hill was just as good, racing hard, dodging trees etc was genuinely exciting. At the hut I stopped and caught my breath. I ran my hands down my sides, over my hips loving the expanse of flesh flowing down my body, unbroken by even a hint of a thong.<br><br>Once I had got my breath back I pulled on my clothes and went home to my rabbit orgasm and sleep.<br><br>Next morning at breakfast my mother was in a different mood.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I was so angry last night‚Äù she said ‚ÄúI suppose you must make your own decisions about your life‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThanks for that Mum‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou do understand that I am most unhappy about you doing this Mail Girl thing. I‚Äôve read about all sorts of bad things in America, girls forced to have sex with workers and worse‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôve been reading about it online as well. The thing is the system used at Messidor is the original Japanese system with certain modifications making it slightly easier for the girls, at least that‚Äôs what their material says‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúJapanese! That makes it all alright does it?‚Äù she paused ‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt do this just for the money, we get by‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI know, although it is very good. No I am doing it to find out a bit about myself as well as the money. Remember for two weeks in training I just get their corporate minimum wage. I should know more when that is over‚Äù<br><br>I wasn‚Äôt being totally honest about finding out about myself, I‚Äôd opened a door and I was going through it unless something dreadful happened in training.<br><br>That night I repeated the run. This time I stripped off at the hut but instead of putting my gear back at the hut I ran down to the road and changed just inside the park by some bushes. Cars went by but they couldn‚Äôt have seen me in the shadows.<br><br>Next night Wednesday I stripped at the bushes and ran all the way to the top and back naked. I was now reaching a point where running naked was better than clothed for all sorts of reasons. The one thing that this didn‚Äôt simulate was the exposure. In the park someone might have seen me, but it was unlikely. Next week many people would definitely have seen me.<br><br>So having spent all of Thursday naked and oiled with my mother out I vowed to do the whole run naked. I waited until around 23.00. Looking out from my bedroom window I couldn‚Äôt see anybody moving about. An occasional car went along the road. I went downstairs and put on my shoes. I was very aware that next week I wouldn‚Äôt even have shoes but the ground in the park was just too rough to dispense with the trainers.<br><br>I opened the back door and stepped out. I checked the key I had hidden in the shed. The rush of air around me immediately heightened my senses and my excitement level went up a notch or two. Going down the side of the house was no problem and when I reached the front garden I started running. I made it across the road easily, there were cars in the distance but much too far away. Up and up I ran, my excitement levels increasing all the time. At the top it was all I could do not to masturbate but I wanted to maintain my edge as I went down the hill faster than I had ever done. At the bottom I skidded to a halt on the pavement without checking for cars.<br><br>Nothing in sight so I ran over the road and back home, safely. In the garden I gave in to my desires and wanked to a glorious leg trembling orgasm leaving me squatting by the back door.<br><br>Is this what next week will be like I wondered. Do the Mailgirls keep going because they are permanently turned on?<br><br>Friday and Saturday I repeated the total naked run with no issues. Sunday it rained. Not heavily but that soft misty rain that comes in summer sometimes. I spent the morning doing my stubble checking, shaving where necessary. The afternoon in my room naked and in a state of excitement and fear.<br><br>At my normal time for the run it was still raining. I looked out of the window initially with disappointment but then had a realisation. What difference would it make, my skin was waterproof, and rain water was good for the hair. I went out. The rain was surprising cold but halfway up the hill my body heat had overcome the cold and I ran on as usual. Standing at the top looking to my right at Messidor I relished the feel of the water running down my body. I reached around and parted my cheeks to let the water flow down my cleft.<br><br>I rushed down the hill in my usual fashion slowing down as I reached the road. A car was coming. I stood and waited, as one would ready to cross. The car slowed down as it reached me and hooted, some men in the car opened their windows and shouted as the crept by. I waved back, as if nothing was unusual, then sprinted across the road into the darkness of the houses. By the back door I had another massively overwhelming orgasm with hardly any rubbing from me. The full exposure was the final element.<br><br>My worry now was that I would want to wank all through the next day, week, year or whatever.

      So 8.00 on Monday morning I presented myself at the main gate at Messidor.<br><br>‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Alice Dawson‚Äù<br><br>The security guard looked at his clipboard and said, without looking up,<br><br>‚ÄúBuilding A, follow the signs, report to the rear door labelled Service‚Äù<br><br>I cycled in, really nervous. There were signs everywhere pointing at the different buildings, my destination, A, was toward the back of the campus up a slight incline. The path wasn‚Äôt straight but meandered around, rather like a natural path in a forest. As I cycled nobody seemed to take any notice of me, although I did see cameras everywhere covering the grounds.<br><br>Building A was well known, there had even been local TV news item about it.<br><br>Basically a horseshoe shape with the centre filled with a large glass atrium. It was the contents of that atrium that interested the local TV.<br><br>From ground up to the top, sixth, floor it contained a micro climate to mirror a tropical rain forest. Inside a small waterfall cascaded down over artificial ledges or shelves. The water eventually collected in a pool at the bottom and then was pumped back to the top to be cleaned and to start it‚Äôs descent again. The pumps were powered by wind or solar energy, as was much of the campus.<br><br>The reception area was at the front of the building but the lifts were at the back so visitors moved around the forest, looking in, as they walked through.<br><br>The front of the atrium was unobstructed apart from a bridge across from one wing to the other on the fourth and top floor.<br><br>I saw a heliport off to one side. A discreet notice on the front said Corporate HQ. The path split just before the doors and I cycled round the side of the building to the back door which was marked very clearly Service. There was a bike rack next to the door and other bikes were already in place. Some were very expensive, unlike mine. None were locked. I looked around and saw a camera pointing at the bike rack so I just shoved my cheap old bike in.<br><br>Was I going to do this? I realised that once I opened the door I would be in a system, oh and a small thing naked. Yes I could back out, that was clear, but other people would be involved and changing my mind would be more complicated.<br><br>I opened the door.<br><br>A middle aged lady was standing in the middle of the hallway.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice Dawson?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúTry again dear‚Äù<br>I remembered<br>‚ÄúYes M‚Äôam‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood‚Äù she looked down ‚Äú I am Lily Palmer your direct supervisor, you are henceforth 28T. You will lose the T if you pass training and you wish to continue and, more importantly, if we wish you to continue‚Äù<br><br>She turned round and with the briefest of gestures indicated for me to follow her.<br><br>Down he hall were double doors and from inside the clear sound of music and showers being run.<br><br>‚ÄúWait here‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes M‚Äôam‚Äù<br><br>She looked inside and shouted<br><br>‚Äú32‚Äù<br><br>A girl came to the door. She was completely naked apart from a neck band which I noticed had her number showing on a small illuminated panel. She had blonde hair cut in a shaggy style, it was long at the back but pulled up with a hair band at the front. Her face was striking with high cheekbones and a strong nose. Her body was slim with average boobs and nice, English, hips. As I expected her vulva was completely smooth and tucked away.<br><br>Lily said ‚Äú32 is your initial trainer, she has considerable experience. Listen to what she says. Later we will pair you with someone else.‚Äù<br><br>She turned to 32 ‚Äúready?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes M‚Äôam‚Äù<br>‚ÄúProceed‚Äù<br><br>32 looked at me and said,<br><br>‚ÄúFollow me Tango‚Äù I knew from reading online that the T for trainee converted into Tango in MG world.<br><br>We went into the shower room. It was long with open shower cubicles down the left hand side. To the right were lockers with benches in front of them, like in a gym or sports changing room. At the far end I could see computer screens. The floor was covered with industrial type carpet. There were three or four naked women in there. 32 pointed at a small locker with a seat in front of it near the door.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is you Tango. Take a seat‚Äù I felt out of place still being dressed amongst all these attractive naked women. 32 squatted down on her haunches knees apart and continued. ‚ÄúOutside the campus you can ask me my name and, if I like you, I might tell you, but in here please just call be 32. D‚Äôaccord?‚Äù She had a slight accent.<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù I was finding it difficult to concentrate because as 32 was squatting in front of me I had a very clear view of her parts, smooth and packed away. She was talking the same way we might talk in the street, with no recognition that I was dressed and she was nude.<br>‚ÄúCool. If there is anything you don‚Äôt understand just ask. For a couple of days there is no pressure. Your initial watch starts at 8.00 so we are running behind live running, that is fine today but get here by 7.30 at the latest tomorrow. As you may know we work three 8 hour watches so today we will finish at 16.00. Obviously this is the main daytime watch and has the most MGs, Mail Girls, on duty.‚Äù<br>I nodded ‚ÄúI‚Äôd read that in the material‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood. Some Tangos come in here having read nothing so that‚Äôs good. This week you are the only Tango so I suspect everyone will just call you that. Next week if we have more starters we may use your number as well.‚Äù<br>She smiled at me.<br>‚ÄúOk lets get you naked and checked out‚Äù I stood up. I was wearing just shorts and a tee shirt.<br><br>‚ÄúThis locker is for Tangos. There are no cameras on it because the Messidor policy is to limit direct pictures of Tangos in case they don‚Äôt make it, some don‚Äôt, cant handle the issue of nudity or whatever‚Äù<br><br>I‚Äôd stripped off my top and was quickly pulling down my shorts. 32 was looking at me very closely. I was surprised to be pleased by her strict gaze.<br><br>‚ÄúI can see why they wanted you‚Äù 32 said ‚Äúclassic MG body. If you make it you will have viewers on your locker camera from the moment you arrive. In these buildings, our client buildings, anyone can look at the MOS channels that cover individual lockers and showers‚Äù<br><br>I stood up.<br><br>‚ÄúStanding position please‚Äù 32 said. I‚Äôd practiced this so hands behind back, legs slightly apart, breasts pushed out. 32 dropped down and inspected my pubes. To my complete surprise she ran her fingers over my mons. I managed not to react but could feel myself lubricating already. ‚ÄòNice and smooth. Turn around and lean forward for me‚Äù This was new to me, not referred to in the manual. She pulled apart my cheeks and I realised she was checking my anus. She grunted. ‚ÄúOk relax. You can use shower number one to wash off the road dirt. I understand you cycled here‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThat might be useful as an MG.‚Äù The shower was nicely set out, big in size with a seat built in, but no door. I showered and she passed me some body balm. ‚ÄúGood to keep lubricated, this is high quality stuff, they buy in bulk. It‚Äôs French.‚Äù I rubbed it all over and massaged it in. 32 grinned. ‚ÄúIf you make it through I can see channel 28 going up the charts. So far you are a natural.‚Äù She handed me a female razor and some foam.<br><br>‚ÄúProbably don‚Äôt need this but get used to spreading and shaving a little when you are in the shower. If you don't then some bright spark might instigate inspection regime‚Äù 32 said.<br><br>‚ÄúYeah, I didn‚Äôt understand how that worked‚Äù I replied<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain later‚Äù<br><br>I finished showering and stood next to 32. I was tingling all over being alongside a beautiful naked woman in this strange place. Quite unlike being naked with friends in bedrooms, something I had only done a couple of times. 32 gestured me over to a computer screen set in the wall at the end of the room. I realised that at this stage I was probably visible to the cameras.<br><br>‚ÄúWhen you are showered and ready to go you stand in front of this and press the green register key. The camera above the screen carries out face recognition and will beep and release your necklace‚Äù 32 gestured to the side where a rack stood, most of the brackets were empty. ‚ÄúYou put the necklace on and it reads your body, a bit like a fitbit, and then you are go on the MOS. Let‚Äôs see if it knows you‚Äù<br><br>She gestured for me to stand in front of the screen and press the green button. There was a moment of spinning onscreen wheels then the screen read.<br><br>28T registered on MOS, take necklace<br><br>‚ÄúWhat is MOS and how does the it know me‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had my photograph taken‚Äù<br><br>32 laughed as she reached for a necklace, now showing 28 on the little illuminated screen. ‚ÄúYou have been on campus for around 25 minutes just today, the MOS knows everyone who is here. Lily would have id‚Äôd you.‚Äù She paused ‚ÄúMOS stands for Messidor Operational System. The computers that run all of this place‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDoes that mean everywhere is on camera and being recorded?‚Äù I asked<br>‚ÄúSort of, I‚Äôll explain as we get going. Next job the MMU. It also monitors you all the time, it‚Äôs how we get instructions‚Äù<br><br>She moved to the next screen, picked up what looked like an Apple Watch and put it on. She then hit the green button on the screen and it soon showed<br><br>MMU Issued to 32<br><br>‚ÄúOK, your turn‚Äù<br><br>I picked up a watch and followed 32s procedure<br><br>MMU issued to 28T - Training Mode<br><br>32 looked at me. She seemed to be assessing me, her look was concentrated but friendly. Without saying anything she walked over to the door.<br><br>‚ÄúOK, this is it Tango, we walk through that door, out of the relative safety of the shower room, and your Mail Girl life starts. I know it‚Äôs trite to say your life won‚Äôt ever be the same, but seriously Tango, it won‚Äôt. I guess nothing you have done will be quite like what you are about to do. Even if you back out this evening you will have been a Mailgirl for one day of your life, that‚Äôll never change. Are you sure you are ready to go‚Äù<br><br>The answer to that question was absolutely Yes and maybe No. I realised that even if I decided against doing this as a job, for today at least, a lot of people were going to see me naked. The whole idea of appearing nude in front of a lot of people I didn‚Äôt know, who were fully dressed and thought of me as a number to be ordered around and ogled, was terrifying but immensely exciting.<br><br>‚ÄúYes, lets go‚Äù<br><br>32 opened the door and we stepped into a stairwell. She started up the steps and I followed. Her vagina was clearly on show as she moved smoothly upwards. We must have climbed five floors when she stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúThe next stage of training or induction is the walkthrough. I have to walk you through Buildings A,B,C,D,E and F.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat, all of them?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, they contain our customers. The two big buildings by the entrance, G&H, are not MG buildings, we don‚Äôt go there routinely. They don‚Äôt have access to the MG material on MOS, thank heavens. I suspect you will know people who work there, I certainly do‚Äù she grinned and paused. ‚ÄúOK, we are about to start the familiarisation process. You will see where everything is, MOS has a chance to look at you. I‚Äôll explain how each floor is organised. It isn‚Äôt difficult because they are all broadly the same‚Äù she grinned ‚Äúyou generally don‚Äôt see what we call textiles on these stairs, they use the lifts. Behind these doors‚Äù she gestured over her shoulder ‚Äúare floors with hundreds of textiles‚Äù<br><br>I grinned. She smiled back<br><br>‚ÄúTango now some slightly unofficial stuff before we head out. I told you about the cameras. They record pretty well everything. This collar and MMU tells MOS where I am at all times and thus MOS can link images to people. That lot out there can watch us individually in the lockers but once we are live they can‚Äôt. The reason is that they might be tempted to create a job on the MOS to try and get one of us in particular. They‚Äù she nodded her head toward the door ‚Äúcan‚Äôt find out where any of us are, but the MOS knows‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou mentioned the charts earlier?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo the MOS records how many views there are of any of us in the locker. We get to see that in our online reports. The textiles can access part of the system to try and see MGs they fancy. The MOS can spot that and record it. They aren‚Äôt supposed to do it as it interferes with work but that hits the dichotomy of the whole MG system. We are there to provide a service but also to tittilate the staff, if they ignored us then the system collapses. So there is a balance. Each of these people have reports sent to their line managers, too much wanking over 28T, for instance, will get them in trouble‚Äù<br><br>I must have looked momentarily shocked<br><br>‚ÄúGet real Tango. That is a the seedy part of this life. They truly are a bunch of real wankers, never forget that but never let it show or you will get mega demerits. Your audience awaits Tango, the wankers know there is fresh meat, a Tango, in the MOS and some of them are anxious to see you. Ready?‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>And 32 opened the doors and stepped out and I followed.<br><br>My new life began.<br><br>I don't know what I expected but whatever it was it didn't happen. I was now standing on an standard grey and green office carpet, surrounded by people in desk pods working away. There was a general hum of activity. What there wasn't was any reaction to the nude me. Nobody ran over to look at my tits or particularly my pussy. My lips had never had extensive exposure to the world and now there they were for everyone to see, except nobody seemed to be looking. 32 whispered to me<br><br>‚ÄúWe sort of fade into the wallpaper if they are busy. If they have nothing much to do, or are taking a timeout then we are attractive and sexy eye candy.‚Äù<br><br>I felt small psychically. They were all clothed in layers of cloth. I was naked. The juxtaposition between nude women, 32 and me, and the routine office space was bizarre and other worldly. I was both scared and excited.<br><br>We moved away from the doors and she turned to me.<br><br>‚ÄúEach floor is numbered. Ground is always 1, the US system. There is a floor above us in A but it‚Äôs the top level directors and we don‚Äôt go there unless invited or instructed. This building is Corporate, although when you are working you don‚Äôt really need to know that.‚Äù She emphasised the need. ‚ÄúEach building is subtly colour coded, you see more green along with the corporate greys in building A, B is more red and so on. It‚Äôs to help the dyslexic or something. Press the top button on the MMU now‚Äù<br><br>I did, it read A5.<br><br>‚ÄòLook around and you will notice the corridor system, even though most of the offices are open plan you can see the pods are subtly arranged in corridors‚Äù<br><br>I looked around. Most of the people were still working, just like a normal office, but a few were now looking over at us. I had a momentary reflex desire to cover up. Then I overcame that and instead stood tall. Want to look at my tits and pussy, go right ahead, I thought, but don‚Äôt ...ing touch. Each of the workers were sitting in a pod that came up to their shoulders when seated. All the pods had a family resemblance but some were bigger than others. I could see the green highlights around the place. Most pods had been personalised with pictures and plants. Some were tidy, some had stuff all over the desks and the floor.<br><br>‚ÄúFollow me‚Äù 32 said. ‚ÄúRemember if anyone talks to you look down and its‚Äôs Sir and Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br><br>I glanced at my MMU. As we walked it showed A5a21, A5a22 and so on. I caught up with 32. In a whisper I asked ‚Äúis this corridor a‚Äù<br><br>She smiled at me and nodded. I guessed that the last number was the desk location. We did the whole floor fairly quickly. Nobody paid an awful lot of attention to us although a couple of men seemed to be standing in each corridor as we passed. I quickly grasped that 32 was known but I wasn‚Äôt so I was the centre of attention. As I walked by these men I looked down.<br><br>What surprised me was the overall lack of reaction, people were getting on with their work. This wasn‚Äôt a show in the sense people had come to see me, nor was it like a beach where everyone was broadly dressed the same, this was a completely different experience. People did look up as we passed but seemed to quickly return to their work. I was aware that the glances were directed at me, not 32.<br><br>Each floor in A was broadly the same until the ground floor. 32 reached that floor but instead of going round the atrium and out through reception she opened the service stairs door.<br><br>‚ÄúGoo‚Äù<br><br>Each floor in A was broadly the same until the ground floor. 32 reached that floor but instead of going round the atrium and out through reception she opened the service stairs door.<br><br>‚ÄúGood stuff Tango. You are getting attention. Did you notice?‚Äù<br>‚Äú... me yes, quite a turn on‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll address that issue later 28T‚Äù she said in a formal way, but with a smile ‚ÄúNow we mustn‚Äôt ever go through reception areas on these buildings without authorisation. So we go down to the basement.‚Äô Once there she carried on ‚Äútwo ways to get to another building. First the obvious way which we will do this time. We are going to run this bit, ready?‚Äù<br><br>She stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúOne more thing. You will get a lot of pickups with MAIL as the destination. If you do then you would come here‚Äù and she pointed to a hatch with a reader beside it ‚Äúor the similar hatches in the other buildings. You simply pop the package into the hatch and touch your MMU to the screen which generates a receipt the sender can see‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúJust occasionally it might say MAIL A in which case you run the package to this mail drop here in building A. The physical pickups go on all day but the last pickup of the day is from this one in A so if someone in C has a package which is urgent and the pickup from C has gone MOS will re-route you to A. D‚Äôaccord‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>‚ÄúCool. Let‚Äôs go‚Äù<br><br>She opened the door to the outside world and set off running at a fast pace, but OK for me. Her bum moved enticingly and I recognised that mine would do the same. My boobs were bouncing as we went. The sun was out and the sensation of running naked across the campus was brilliant. We quickly got to B and went in the service door.<br><br>‚ÄúWe run between buildings because out there we are useless. Nobody to pick up from. In here we are productive‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat happens in winter?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you later. OK this is B, Finance and Legal. These textiles are our heavy users. Some are complete arseholes, but eventually harmless. You just look down, do the Yessir Nosir stuff and then run your route.‚Äù<br><br>We climbed this time to Floor 6. As we did another MG came down the stairs fast, as she reached us she waved and grinned and ran on. The sight of a completely naked girl moving fast was exciting. From the top we worked our way down as before. A number of the men and even a couple of the women looked very pointedly at me. I felt like doing a bit of a show, a bit of a wiggle, but knew that was demerit country. At one point the corridor was blocked by what looked like an ad hoc meeting. 32 stopped and adopted the standing position. I followed suit. I couldn‚Äôt believe that these men would ignore two beautiful nude women but they did, they were engrossed in whatever they were talking about. Eventually one of them realised we were there and they moved over. As they did so I heard one say.<br><br>‚ÄúAh, the new Tango, totally up to scratch I‚Äôd say‚Äù<br><br>When we reached the bottom of the building we went into the service stairs and 32 said<br><br>‚ÄúWhen we were stopped by that group we have to just stand still in the standing position until they move. If we have a package we can go back and go round but not if we are just moving to a resting place.‚Äù<br><br>She opened the door and again we sprinted naked across the campus to the next building. The process was similar but when we reached the second floor 32 stopped and indicated an area, by the lifts, where the carpet was a different colour. She dropped to her knees and gestured me down. I knew what to do. I kneeled down rocking back on my haunches and spread my knees. The end result revealed my pussy completely and possibly my anus. A man was waiting by the lift. He looked at me closely then down to my parts. He then moved back into the office space and reappeared with two other men who spent some time inspecting me closely. I could feel my juices starting and worried if this would show.<br><br>32 stood up and I followed. We moved around the men, one of whom said ‚ÄúOh‚Äù and headed down to the next floor. In the service stairs we stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúSo how was that Tango?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúPretty weird. Nobody, apart from a doctor, has ever looked at my pussy like that.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt is a nice pussy‚Äù 32 said ‚Äúlove the protruding lips, much more interesting than mine‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDo you think so?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSure, the textiles are going to love it‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me. Up and down.<br><br>‚ÄúTurned on Tango?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIf you need to do something about it then the safest place is the toilets in the basement of any building, those are the ones we are able to use. If you can come quick then the stairwells have seen their fair share of orgasms, just don‚Äôt take too long or MOS will know.‚Äù And she laughed.‚ÄùMOS knows everything‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAre there cameras here?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúProbably, assume they are everywhere. We do know that stairwell cameras never go on public access on MOS‚Äù<br><br>After C we ran back up the hill to A.<br><br>32 stopped outside the service door.<br><br>‚ÄúYou probably haven't noticed this. Back there‚Äù and she gestured up the slight slope behind A ‚Äúthere are some low buildings, some of them in the trees‚Äù<br><br>I looked up and could just see, beyond the helipad, a single storey building. A path skirted the helipad and went up to a set of doors.<br><br>She went on ‚Äúthose are the Messidor laboratories. They test products and develop new things up there. You might get a instruction which says LAB. What you do is to go up there, the necklace will unlock the door, and you go into the lobby. Usually there is a security person there and you either give your package to them or collect from them‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDo we ever go inside?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot unaccompanied. Top Secret‚Äù and she grinned<br>‚ÄúThey aren't regular users of MGs‚Äù she added.<br><br>We went into the basement again and then into the locker room.<br><br>Other MGs were sitting around eating lunch or showering. I noticed that they didn‚Äôt shave this time but did lather up and then use more of the body lotion. Music was playing quite loudly. 32 sat on the bench and gesticulated to me to sit in front of the Trainee locker. I had brought some energy bars and re-hydration drink. I didn‚Äôt think I needed it but since the morning hadn‚Äôt been physically strenuous, but definitely psychically strenuous.<br><br>‚ÄúOn a normal day your MMU will indicate lunch, you get 30 minutes for lunch and two 15 minute breaks, all managed by MOS‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>‚ÄúThe toilets are back there‚Äù 32 indicated over her shoulder ‚Äúuse them now‚Äù<br><br>I had a pee. The toilets had doors and for the first time I had some privacy. I didn‚Äôt feel I needed it however so quickly finished, used the provided wet wipes, and came out. Other MGs were using the loos but often with the door open chatting to others. Back with 32 I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the music?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget the cameras are on us, the music plays at certain times. When the shift ends we get current big dance hits to make us dance around to add to the joy of the corporate watchers‚Äù<br><br>Lunch over we set off again from A to D. A was like the point of an irregular V with B & C down one side and DEF down the other.<br><br>In the basement of D 32 said.<br><br>‚ÄúYou asked about winter, see this door‚Äù she pointed at a door labelled Service Cabling Restricted ‚Äúit is an electronically secured door. Access is limited. However in the winter, if the temperature gets too low, our necklaces will unlock those doors and there are tunnels which lead from building to building. There aren‚Äôt any cross tunnels though so if, for instance, you had to go from C to F you go all the way back to A then down to F. Time consuming. Many of us brave the wind, cold and rain and just run outside, it‚Äôs actually good.‚Äù She stopped and thought ‚Äúalthough I‚Äôve never done it in the snow‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt snow much down here‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, melts almost immediately.‚Äù<br><br>We ended in F which was HR. On the top floor 32 stopped outside one of the closed offices and knocked. Someone shouted enter. I recognised where we were, Jackie Whitten‚Äôs office.<br><br>She smiled and gestured for us to kneel. Then she came round the desk and sat on it looking down at us.<br><br>‚Äú32; how is Tango doing?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúVery well Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br>‚ÄúTango, I have been monitoring MOS, the feedback appears very good. Tangos usually attract attention, new blood and all that but you are one of the highest scoring Tangos we have had for some time. Your general appearance and‚Äù she gestured at my parts‚Äù the thing that you worried about, attract particular comment as I knew they would. Not sure we can do much to improve that but please remember that advantage you have, nice wide leg posture at all times without appearing unnatural‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you Ma‚Äôam‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúGood. Tango you can go home after the shower. 32 will finish the shift. Tango be ready tomorrow to follow 32 on a simulated day‚Äôs work so be in uniform and logged on by 8.00‚Äù<br><br>Logging off was easy. I faced the screen in the shower room and hit the relevant keys. MOS recognised me and with a buzz the necklace unlocked. I was instructed to place the necklace on the rack and remove the MMU. The screen politely said Thank You and wished me goodbye and stated that it would see me the next morning before 08.00. Very efficient.<br><br>My mother was waiting for me in the kitchen, sitting at the kitchen table.<br><br>‚ÄúSo, how was it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúFine, no problems. Didn‚Äôt do any runs, just familiarisation with the place.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh‚Äù she paused and looked pointedly at me ‚Äúnaked?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOf course naked‚Äù I smiled ‚ÄúNo point in walking around clothed. Naked is the uniform‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCant see how naked is a uniform‚Äù she said, emphasising the word uniform.<br>‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs what we call it‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs we already is it‚Äù<br><br>She studied me.<br><br>‚ÄúHow was that‚Äù she hesitated ‚Äúuniform?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood, as I said no problems‚Äù<br><br>She looked thoughtful.<br><br>‚ÄúPeople say that most of the girls who keep at it end up loving the running around naked, even do it at home and stuff. Have you got that inside of you do you think?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúToo soon to say ‚Äú I lied. I had begun to realise that I did enjoy the running around naked, as she put it.<br>‚ÄúSomeone told me that a man two streets over with a really good job was fired on the spot for touching a girls bottom, is that right?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCould well be, the manual says if we are touched inappropriately we report it on our watch things and staff members can get fired. Doesn‚Äôt surprise me‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSeen the boss man, Vaux?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, we didn‚Äôt go onto the top floor of that building without being asked, so don‚Äôt even know if he was there‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThey say he is weird‚Äù<br><br>I grinned.<br><br>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing research haven‚Äôt you mother‚Äù<br><br>She grinned back<br><br>‚ÄúNeed to know what my little girl is getting into. I still live in hope you decide against it but it doesn‚Äôt sound as bad as some people make out, once you get over the tits and arse stuff. I suppose Messidor are too big to have scandals‚Äù<br>

      I cycled up to A around 7.20, I was early but that was fine.<br><br>Lily was in the hallway.<br><br>‚ÄúMorning 28T, first day went well I understand. First hurdle completed. MOS had no issues, you can move around the buildings in uniform and in a natural way. Always a helpful attribute, do remember to be as easy as you can be, don‚Äôt react to the stares. I understand that you are to ensure that your stance, without being too provocative, should be open legged, or at ease as far as possible. We will be reviewing that. Any questions?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOff you go then, into uniform procedure‚Äù<br><br>I went into the changing room, quickly stripped off and put my clothes and lunch into the Trainee locker and headed for the showers. Other girls were in already and I simply chose one of the cubicles and turned on the water. The flow was very good. I lathered up and washed myself thoroughly even though I had showered at home. Thinking about it there didn‚Äôt seem any point in that, just come in here and shower.<br><br>So far this wasn‚Äôt that far removed from a school changing room, if a little better fitted out and with added music. I stepped out and collected some of the body lotion and a disposable razor and foam.<br><br>I sat down on the seat. Spreading my legs I lathered up and started shaving my pubes away. Then underarm and down the legs. This whole process was very weird, definitely not like school. Tugging my lips around in public seemed so outrageous, except I could see down the showers other MGs doing exactly the same thing. I tickled my clit then got back under the shower to wash the foam off.<br><br>The lotion was fine, rubbing it in all over was in itself pleasurable and over my boobs and vulva more than pleasurable. One of the MGs passing by shouted in to me<br><br>‚ÄúNo wanking in the showers Tango‚Äù with a laugh<br><br>I was a little embarrassed, but I realised it was a joke.<br><br>I went back and sat in front of my locker. More MGs were moving about than yesterday. 32 came in.<br><br>‚ÄúMorning Tango, get your neckband and MMU while I do the shower stuff‚Äù<br><br>The computer recognised me almost immediately and I took the necklace and put it on. There was an imperceptible buzz when it locked. It wouldn‚Äôt come off until the end of the shift. Then the MMU and again it identified me immediately.<br><br>I looked at the MMU. I was sort of familiar with it‚Äôs layout from the manual. 32 saw me looking.<br><br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs today‚Äôs training Tango. And we will check on what we did yesterday, your ability to move around the buildings‚Äù<br><br>She was standing in front of her locker towelling herself off very extravagantly, wiggling her hips and lifting her boobs in the process. I watched fascinated.<br><br>‚ÄúNeed to keep in those charts Tango, you‚Äôll get used to it‚Äù and she gave a rueful grin.<br><br>At 8.00 sharp 32 and I headed out of A into the campus. Various textiles were making their way into work. Most ignored us as we jogged down toward F although I did notice some paying me particular attention, Tango factor I decided. My boobs were jogging nicely, the heat in the air made the ground easy to cover in bare feet. The paving was smooth. The rush of air over my vulva and arse was amazing. I was thinking about the Spartans who exercised in the nude and realising that they were right.<br><br>Through the service door in F and a slow climb up the stairs. 32 stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúTango, ready?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, I guess‚Äù<br><br>She did something on her MMU and suddenly mine vibrated and gave a low ting. I looked at it. It read.<br><br>B3c12<br><br>I looked at 32 who just nodded. OK here we go, down the stairs fast and out onto the campus. We were in F so B was slightly to my right. There was no direct path so I headed out over the grass at speed. Looking up to avoid textiles I ran a curve judging where they would be so as to avoid them, to the service door, in and up three floors. Corridor c would be the far corridor so down I went to pod 12. There was nobody there, it appeared vacant. When I stopped the MMU buzzed again. It showed a negative number.<br><br>‚ÄúVery good Tango. Rest area‚Äù and she tilted her head set off to the lift. I followed and we both dropped into the kneeling pose.<br><br>‚ÄúThe negative number is the time allowance you earned on that run.‚Äù 32 explained ‚ÄúYou beat the nominal time‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo what is the nominal time?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the time MOS thinks you should take, bearing in mind weather, time and other issues.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI thought we were given an actual time‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThats the old system. MOS contains an update on the Hiromoto original. It is quite new and MOS is still learning about the routes. Each time one of us runs it measures and adjusts the nominal.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI guess it also learns about us‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúYou are getting the idea Tango‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCan I offset negatives against positives?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo. A positive is a positive and is a de-merit. A negative is just a good thing, ego massage for naked women‚Äù she grinned.<br><br>Whilst this was going on I was focussing on 32. I glanced to my right and realised that there was a group of textile men staring at me whilst pretending to wait for the lift. My body, without thinking, made my boobs and pubic area alive with whatever. I could feel myself turning on. Ignoring all this 32 continued.<br><br>‚ÄúRight, MOS is now going to give you a typical Tuesday set of tasks. None of your destinations will be occupied so when you get there adopt the standing position for a brief moment then go to the nearest rest area. Good to go?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood to go‚Äù<br><br>The men were still staring at me and murmuring to each other. My MMU buzzed.<br><br>F2a4<br><br>I was up like a flash. As I did so one of the men said<br><br>‚ÄúThat Tango is beautiful. Lets hope she makes it I could look at that c**t all day‚Äù<br><br>I spun through the doors feeling good and ran down the stairs and out onto the campus. Again the run was over the grass. I ran slightly slower because I knew there would be a steady stream of instructs. I reached the destination with another negative and adopted the standing position. Before I could move MMU buzzed.<br><br>Mail<br><br>Turning away I moved briskly along the corridor back to the stairs and ran down to the basement. At the hatch 32 gestured for me to tap the MMU on the readier. I gave 32 a quizzical look, Where to now?.<br><br>‚ÄúWe are in a basement so no need to go to a rest area. If you needed the loo you could touch the temporary logout button on the MMU and do whatever, if you take too long MOS will register. OK, usually the screen gives you a pickup and a destination. It means that the user doesn‚Äôt have to actually talk to us. Some do, some don‚Äôt. The idea is that we are simply part of MOS. They are supposed to have the package ready when we arrive. Each package has a sticker attached to it with a unique bar code, MOS can track them. You go to the location, adopt the standing position and wait. Today I‚Äôll tap you when you should Move on to the destination. When you reach the destination, you would deliver the package into the basket thing at the end of the desk, wait for MMU clearance and then go to the nearest rest area unless there is another job. So ready?‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>D6b15>D1a2<br><br>Off we went again. I soon realised that running too fast was an issue, need to manage energy. I was sweating a little and probably a bit red in the face. When I reached the first location the MMU gave a buzz and then all it showed was the second location or destination. I stood in the standing position for a little time. Textiles moved passed me in the corridor. Then 32 tapped my shoulder and I set off for D1a2. When I got there the MMU immediately showed a new job.<br><br>C4a8>B6c12<br><br>At each destination 32 tapped my shoulder until, towards the end she started tapping my arse. That was very nice and I wondered why she had changed. At some destinations we kneeled by the lifts for a few minutes which enabled us to get our breath back.<br><br>Thus the morning ran on. We had a break, MMU told us to take it and then gave a countdown of the 15 minutes. We sat down in a basement backs to the wall knees up getting our breathe back.<br><br>The moment the 15 minutes were up.<br><br>A3c6>C6a3<br><br>The morning flashed by. I was hot, high with adrenaline and endorphins, sexually alive and thinking.<br><br>Who wouldn‚Äôt want to do this?<br><br>LUNCH<br><br>We both sprinted back to basement of A and flopped down.<br><br>‚ÄúTake a shower Tango‚Äù<br><br>I dived in and washed and lotioned. 32 stood in the next shower doing the same. She had a gorgeous figure I decided and, with some pleasure, I watched as she lotioned her bum and labia.<br><br>MMU started a countdown at 10 minutes and we were off again.<br><br>As the day started running down I had two jobs like this<br><br>B3c15>MAILA<br><br>And I remembered what 32 said about the last mail drop.<br><br>My last job, I thought, was one of those and I was pleased that I‚Äôd beaten nominal time on every job during the day. 32 and I were leaning against the wall in the A basement as the time approached 16.00 when my MMU showed.<br><br>A6.4<br><br>32 looked surprised but said ‚ÄúSixth floor, lets go‚Äù<br><br>I sprinted up the stairs fascinated by the thought of being naked on the top floor, amongst the real leaders. I wondered if John Vaux was going to be there. Coming out of the stairwell I was momentarily disoriented. There were no corridors, just a big open space with the glass atrium with the plants and waterfall taking up the centre. The offices were arranged around the outer walls. I glanced left and saw office 7 so I looked right and there were 4 and 5. Clockface. I ran round and stopped by 4 in stand position but remembering to keep my legs slightly apart, as instructed. 32 stopped by me.<br><br>A voice said.<br><br>‚ÄúSo this is the latest Tango. You can turn around.‚Äù<br><br>I turned around and there was John Vaux looking at me. He was young looking, given I knew he was 72 years old. He had white hair cut in a fashionably polite long style. His eyes were blue and sparkling. He had a small white goatee beard. He was staring at me intently. Then he looked down at my breasts then down again, taking a step back to improve his view. He circled around me, I could imagine him looking at my arse. I realised I was quite sweaty.<br><br>‚ÄúWell young lady in between other important tasks I have been tracking you on MOS. You are very impressive. Beat nominal every time I think, need to watch that, I might get our software people to look at that.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you sir‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm the one person in this organisation you don‚Äôt have to call Sir. Mr Vaux will do fine‚Äù he pronounced it Vorx.<br>‚ÄúThank you‚Äù<br>‚Äú32 knows me, that‚Äôs right isn‚Äôt it 32?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes Mr Vaux‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI think I may have kept you over the end of your shift. Sorry about that. I am sure I will meet both of you again quite soon. Assuming you decide to continue, Tango, which I sincerely hope you do‚Äù<br><br>He spun around and almost immediately the MMU showed.<br><br>MAILA<br><br>When we reached the basement and went into the locker I turned to 32<br><br>‚ÄúF**k me, Is that usual?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, but he is known to do it sometimes, he did it to me. He can obviously play God on his own system.‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me in a different way than usual, as if for the first time she saw me as something other than Tango<br><br>‚ÄúBy the way good of you to spot how the sixth floor is different, I was pleased you didn‚Äôt panic‚Äù<br><br>At home I was able to tell my mother that I had met John Vaux, that I had run who knows how many meters and that I was now ready for bed.<br><br>In my bedroom, naked again, I lay on the bed. I was tired but my head was spinning. I reached down and felt my pussy. The pussy that for a second day had spent it‚Äôs time exposed to anybody who saw me. I thought about the various people I had run by but in particular thought about 32 and the other MGs. I felt my arousal start then very quickly as I rubbed myself I knew I was close and I came in a glorious orgasm.<br><br>I lay back and as my spasms subsided I thought about John Vaux.<br><br>I had researched him online last week whilst preparing. He was a famous or, if you prefer, a notorious businessman and celebrity. During the sixties and early seventies he was a hippy. He had joined a collective, his words, or a cult, press words, in Europe. The press always referred to them as a sex cult but even I could see from a little research that that was a tabloid exaggeration. They were an anarchist group who believed that property was theft and that sex was a natural urge that should never be suppressed. The ‚Äúproperty is theft‚Äù rule covered clothes and much of the time in photographs the cult members seemed to be nude.<br><br>The cult lived in two camps, one in southern Germany and one on a Greek Island. The money came from a German industrialist, a former member of the SS, who died in the late seventies. When that happened, the money ran out and, as tends to be the case, the collective broke up.<br><br>John had started a small business selling books on hippy philosophy, the occult, flying saucers and similar stuff. The business grew into something of a mail order phenomenon physically based in the UK. He had continual tussles with the law since some of the books were deemed obscene or illegal due to sex and drug and revolution references. He got round most of his problems by running the business through various international shell companies based in convenient offshore locations.<br><br>Even before the internet arrived he had become something of a celebrity often referred to as the Sex Cult Millionaire. There were many images online of him naked in groups of other young naked people; most seemed to have been taken in the sixties and seventies. The free love aspect of the collective was rumoured to have extended to underage members, although there was no evidence linking Vaux to this. The German industrialist financing the collective was frequently alleged to have been a pedophile although, again, there was never any evidence of this either. Recent research suggested that these allegations were mostly fabricated by parents trying to recover their runaway children from the collective.<br><br>Whatever his background the internet enabled Vaux‚Äôs business to expand exponentially until it grew into the current Messidor with stores in prime locations worldwide and a massive online shop selling a huge and exotic range of products.<br>

      I left the house at seven not having showered, there didn‚Äôt seem an point given what I would do at work.<br><br>Lily Palmer was, as usual, waiting in the corridor.<br><br>‚ÄúMorning 28T‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMorning Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood report from yesterday. Today is your last day with 32, tomorrow I‚Äôm putting you on a different shift.‚Äù<br><br>I was disappointed, I had bonded with 32.<br><br>‚ÄúYou can have a lie in and start at 16.00. I‚Äôll link you with another MG who is on that shift‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me in a studied manner<br><br>‚ÄúYou seem to be doing well. I doubt we will keep you in T mode for much longer. You need to work all the shifts to learn what is done. On your current performance I think you will be a useful member of the team. Off you go‚Äù<br><br>Inwardly smiling I went into the shower room. A few MGs were there. They nodded at me. One shouted<br><br>‚ÄúMorning Tango‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMorning‚Äù<br><br>I stashed my clothes, for what they were, in the locker, collected the lotion, razor and foam and headed for a shower cubicle. There was music pumping through and one of the girls was dancing around naked, no doubt for the edification of the textile viewers.<br><br>I stood under the hot water for a couple of minutes. The shower was much better than the one we had at home. Then the usual routine, wash myself off then onto the seat and shave. I did the armpits first, not that they needed much, then onto the pubes. Carefully foaming my mons I shaved off the stubble, such as it was, then onto vulva. As usual much pulling and lifting required to get at all the areas needed. Then finally leaning back doing the bum hole area.<br><br>I looked up. 32 was watching me. She hadn‚Äôt stripped yet. I smiled at her.<br><br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be number 1 on the charts for a while‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou shaving, quite a show‚Äù she grinned ‚Äúkept my attention‚Äù then she turned away and stripped off.<br><br>After some more test runs and our break 32 had us kneeling in C near to HR.<br><br>‚ÄúOK, she said, test runs off for a while. What do you know about inspections?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúTextiles can inspect us at any time‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWrong, that has changed, thank heavens‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt was being abused and interfering with efficiency. New system in place. If a textile thinks an inspection is justified they have to go onto MOS and request permission. They have to give a reason. Just fancying a closer look at your vagina isn‚Äôt a good reason. MOS will know, for instance, if you have had an inspection that day and will refuse another. It knows how many inspections any particular textile has requested and takes that into account. It factors in other things; who knows what MOS knows about the people here.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo how does it work?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThey have to enter the request in MOS. Your MMU will look like this‚Äù and she did something on hers. Mine buzzed and read.<br><br>INSP>WAIT<br><br>‚ÄúSo you adopt standing and wait. If you have moved on and they request it will say this‚Äù Mine buzzed again<br><br>INSP>RETURN<br><br>‚ÄúAnd you go back to the last place you were at. You know you can scroll them don‚Äôt you‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôd guessed that‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThen it might say this‚Äù<br><br>INSP>REFUSE<br><br>‚ÄúIn which case you carry on to the next job or the nearest rest area. Or it will say‚Äù<br><br>INSP>COMPLY<br><br>‚ÄúWhich means you do what they say although there are only a few fixed commands they can give. Remember they still can‚Äôt touch. It can be pretty degrading, especially if they do it in the open office, which some bastards or bitches do‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBitches?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get proportionally way more INSP from women than men. Under the new system the men are much less likely to ask for fear of creating an MOS record. The women either do it for spite or because they fancy you but don‚Äôt like to admit it‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo follow me‚Äù<br><br>She got up and walked toward Jackie Whitten‚Äôs office. Without going in she touched her MMU and mine said<br><br>INSP>WAIT<br><br>I stood in the standing position remembering to have my legs slightly wider. Jackie Whitten came out of her office. She was dressed in a black trouser suit. I noticed that she had on what looked like a neckband, albeit one encrusted in jewels. My MMU buzzed.<br><br>INSP>COMPLY<br><br>‚ÄúStar position 28T‚Äù<br><br>I spread my legs wide and lifted my arms up and out to the side. I could hear a murmur in the office.<br><br>Jackie slowly looked at my boobs, then under my arms both sides. Then she dropped down and stared at my pubic area closely. I could feel her breath. She stood up, I thought it was over but then she said.<br><br>‚ÄúTouch the floor 28T‚Äù<br><br>This was new, I hadn‚Äôt read about this in the manual. But then it referred to the old system. I complied. I knew now that my whole vulva and anus would be on display. She moved around behind me and again I was aware she was very close to me. Then to my surprise I felt her twice blow on my labia. It was unmistakable, and I felt myself moistening up.<br><br>‚ÄúStanding position 28T‚Äù<br><br>With relief, I resumed what now seemed a very modest pose. Jackie looked at me and then 32 and said<br><br>‚ÄúProceed‚Äù<br><br>We went back to the waiting area. I was aware of the sound of people returning to their desks and assumed I had been the high spot of some afternoons.<br><br>‚ÄúSee what I mean‚Äù 32 said ‚Äúthe touch the floor is new. It is supposed to avoid the need for them to clamber between your legs to look for whatever. I suppose it is better except, instead of one pair of eyes looking at your parts you now could have the whole office looking.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCould they take pictures on their phones‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCould but very definitely shouldn‚Äôt. They‚Äôve fired people for that. Textiles can save a limited number of official pictures from MOS on their system here. You‚Äôll see‚Äù she smiled ‚Äúassuming you keep going.‚Äù She paused and stretched, arching her back and making her boobs stand out. ‚ÄúA few months ago a picture of an INSP popped up online. MOS knew who the MG was and where the INSP had happened and could work out who took it from the angles. The picture disappeared from the usual web although it‚Äôs probably still on the dark web, the guy who took it was fired‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat if you fail the INSP?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDownstairs, full shower procedure, then back for second check. If that happens the shower cams will re-activate for the textile pleasure‚Äù<br><br>I was very unclear about my feelings at this moment. Such an exposure of my undercarriage was troubling, not least because I was a little excited by it. More fascinating was the two breathes on my labia from Jackie, what did that mean?<br><br>After lunch 32 took me to a rest area in A.<br><br>‚ÄúOK, last couple of things I need to deal with and then you and me are done‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her. She just looked back.<br><br>‚ÄúFirst very occasionally you will be on a run and the MMU will say STOP. That means what it says. If you are in the stairs or basement just stay where you are. If you are on a rest area go into the nearest stairwell.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhy‚Äù<br>‚ÄúUsually there is someone on the floor who isn‚Äôt a regular, a visitor maybe, so the MG system stops until they are clear‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI meant to ask, what if there is a meeting with people from G or H?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThere are meeting and conference facilities down there, this lot go to them‚Äù and she grinned<br><br>‚ÄúNext, Rush jobs or what we call plus jobs. The MOS allows the user to ask for a rush response. They only have limited access to plus jobs depending on all sorts of seniority crap. We don‚Äôt have to understand, as they say, trust MOS‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI thought we were always supposed to go fast?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot really, I know you have been pacing yourself, we all do. But I suspect you could go faster in short bursts‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo let me show you then we‚Äôll do it‚Äù<br><br>My MMU buzzed.<br><br>A2c5+<br><br>‚ÄúThe key is the plus sign. If you get that you go just as fast as you can, you are allowed to push past people, politely, in the corridors, for instance. MOS will learn the really quick MGs and will tend to allocate plus jobs to them. Let‚Äôs give it a try. Move down the corridor with me slowly, but be ready to go‚Äù<br><br>We strolled slowly down the corridor then I buzzed.<br><br>F4b6+<br><br>I spun round and started jogging toward the stairs. 32 said<br><br>‚Äú...ing run‚Äù<br><br>So I did, fast. I guess the pair of us must have been quite a sight because heads turned<br><br>Down the stairs, jumping onto landings and out onto the campus. I ran hard and fast pumping my arms and really feeling the hormones kicking in. In F I threw open the door and took the stairs two at a time up to 4. There I ran hard down corridor b, swerving round a couple of textiles to stop at 6. I was breathing hard. 32 arrived slightly behind me. My MMU showed.<br><br>+SD<br><br>‚ÄúWhat does SD mean?‚Äù I said between breaths<br>‚ÄúIt means Stand Down, we can go to the stairs. Don‚Äôt have to go to a rest area‚Äù<br><br>Still breathing heavily we stood on the stairs out of sight of the office.<br><br>‚ÄúIf there is a delivery, which there usually is, you keep going at plus speed but when the whole job is done you get SD. The MOS monitors your heart rate and stuff and when it is back to normal it will buzz again. It means you get a sweaty couple of minutes off.<br><br>I leant against the stairwell.<br><br>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there is much I can teach you now. You are good Tango‚Äù She paused and leant close to my ear and whispers. ‚ÄúMy name is Erica‚Äù<br>I turned to her<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm Alice‚Äù<br>‚ÄúPleased to meet you Alice‚Äù then she leant further in and kissed me square on my lips. I was shocked but also interested. I pushed back a little, and opened my mouth. Then, to my surprise, I felt her hand on my bum again and she was squeezing and then pulling my cheek apart so the air flowed over my anus‚Äù.<br>‚ÄúI think we can be friends‚Äù she said then turned away down the stairs.<br><br>I stood there for a while, I hadn‚Äôt had any serious sexual contact with girls, just mucking about, but what just happened was a massive turn on. I wanted more of that but she had gone. Then the MMU buzzed and said<br><br>BASE<br><br>I ran back at normal pace to the lockers. Lily Palmer was there.<br><br>‚ÄúGood work 28T. See you at 16.00 tomorrow.‚Äù<br><br>In the shower room my necklace gave a little buzz and unchecked so I hung it up together with the MMU and a little reluctantly got dressed.<br><br>Mum went out to work early next day so I just lazed around the house, most of the time naked. Messidor was about 20 minutes bike ride from home so I set off around 3. Quickly stripped and showered I logged on.<br><br>Lily came in and shouted to me to join her. Outside, leaning against the wall, was a slim, long legged girl with dark black hair. She had hardly any tits but did have a gorgeous tan.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is 44, she‚Äôll run you through the evening shift things, OK?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br><br>44 smiled at me and said.<br><br>‚ÄúYou know the usual routine so just follow me around. You can lead some of the jobs later‚Äù<br><br>She had a very obvious Irish accent.<br><br>44 looked at her MMU and we set off. The difference this time was that instead of MOS simulating 44 was actually working so when we arrived at a destination real people interacted with us. Most of the time nothing was said. We stopped in a corridor and adopted the standing position. Someone would be aware we had arrived and they produced a package which we carried briskly to destination. Sometimes they would pass the time. After about an hour 44 said<br><br>‚ÄúOK Tango, your turn, lead the next one‚Äù<br><br>She did something to her MMU and suddenly mine lit up.<br><br>E3c12>B4a01<br><br>We were In D so down the stairs I ran across the small bit of the campus swerving around textiles at speed and up to the third floor. A secretary looked up as I arrived.<br><br>‚ÄúOh the Tango‚Äù she said in a flat voice and handed me the package whilst looking me up and down ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get lost dear‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you ma‚Äôam‚Äù I said, but she had turned back to her screen<br><br>Down the stairs and across the grass to B and upto 4 which was legal. A01 was a man sitting at a desk. He looked up as I arrived, did something on his keyboard and gestured at his desk and went back to whatever he was doing. I put the package down and turned to 44 who was already walking down to the rest area by the lift. We kneeled down.<br><br>‚ÄúFirst real job Tango, no longer a virgin‚Äù she laughed<br>‚ÄúDo they usually ignore us?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, used to be they had to accept the package and bastards would ignore us but now MOS knows you, and the package, are at destination and if they don‚Äôt hit the received key within around 30 secs then something happens on their system.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat if nobody is there?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat will probably happen before we are done tonight, you‚Äôll see‚Äù<br><br>There was a busy period up until 18.45 then things really slowed down. I did most of the jobs with 44 watching. There were a few MailA deliveries as the shift moved on.<br><br>We had a break at 19.00. We sat on the floor in F.<br><br>‚ÄúQuieter here, HR don‚Äôt work late. Buildings A & B can be busy all night‚Äù 44 explained ‚ÄúLily wants you to do a particular job this evening, I‚Äôll come with you to show you the ropes‚Äù<br><br>At 19.40 we both got<br><br>MailA>#<br><br>‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù I shouted to 44 as we ran up to A<br>‚ÄúThis is the thing Lily wants you to do‚Äù We ran into A and up to the Mail location. As we got there it opened. Inside was a small number of packages.<br><br>44 picked up a Messidor back pack hanging on a hook by the hatch and put the packages inside.<br><br>‚ÄùTango, follow me‚Äù<br><br>She ran out of the building and headed down the campus toward the main gate. I had no idea where we were going. It took no time to go beyond the end of buildings C and F into what might be called the non MG area. I realised that buildings G and H were largely now empty but nonetheless we were getting close to the road and the entrance gate. I ran down to keep up with 44.<br><br>She headed straight for the gate house but just before we reached there she turned to her left to a small building I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. She opened a door marked private and gestured for me to follow her in.<br><br>Inside was a small office. An old guy was sitting in there at a desk. As 44 walked in he looked up, grinned at her and then studied me.<br><br>‚ÄúFinal mail Sir‚Äù she said<br>‚ÄúNice looking new girl‚Äù 44 ignored him, looked at her MMU which beeped<br>‚ÄúReceipt confirmed, thank you sir‚Äù she said and gestured me out<br>‚ÄúLovely pair of arses‚Äù I heard him say as we left.<br><br>Outside 44 stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúSo that is the worst regular run. The hash indicates this place, the general mail room. That guy is an old wanker. He almost always makes comments. We‚Äôve all complained but they won‚Äôt do anything. So you do like I did. MOS normally recognises delivery pretty quickly so you just stand for a couple of seconds‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHow does the mail get there other times?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThe mailroom sends a runner up. You may ask why they don‚Äôt do send a runner for the last delivery.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, Why change the system‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWrong question, why don‚Äôt we get sent down for all of them is the right question. Answer because G and H would be fully occupied and we‚Äù she emphasised the we ‚Äúare not for them. At this time they‚Äôve gone home and it‚Äôs quiet so we can go down to their area‚Äù<br><br>I looked over at the buildings. Nobody much seemed to be around. 44 started walking back up to our area.<br><br>‚ÄúNominal 44?*<br>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt one for this delivery. I think Vaux likes the idea of us strolling about naked‚Äù She turned and grinned at me.<br>‚ÄúHow you doing Tango, everyone thinks you‚Äôll be with us next week‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. I love the activity‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd the nudity‚Äù she stopped again and looked in my eyes ‚Äúyou like the nudity, yes?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúUh, yes‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlmost all of us contract MGs get off on being naked but untouchable. Go round moist most of the day with endorphins and adrenalin pumping. Some girls simply can‚Äôt hack it but others, once they decide to go naked, just go with it. You‚Äôre almost certainly one of them. Wearing much at home now?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo. How did you know?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúTypical behaviour. It‚Äôs summer so its hot, why dress if you don‚Äôt need to.‚Äù<br><br>She grabbed my hand and we walked, hand in hand back to A.<br><br>It was quiet. By this stage there were just four of us at work. MGs working overtime or on demerits filled in unto 20.00.<br><br>44 re-routed her MMU to me so at 22.15, when it was dark, I got this.<br><br>B5a2>E5b2<br><br>I ran out of A into the night. I could easily make my way to the building and ran up to the fifth floor. The building was dark with a few lights on. I assumed that for energy saving lights were turned off when there was no activity. I also noticed that I didn‚Äôt seem to trigger any lights and I ran down the corridor in the dark and stopped at the desk. A youngish guy looked up, smiled and handed me the package.<br><br>‚ÄúThank you sir‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúVery formal Tango, Ok off you go‚Äù<br><br>I sprinted over to E, glad of the activity. There was a bit of a chill in the air so running hard kept me warm. Desk b2 was empty and the corridor dark, I put the package on the desk and waited. MMU confirmed receipt and I headed back to the rest area by the lifts. Adopting the kneeling position I looked around.<br><br>There were a couple of lights on. I was getting my breath back when I saw a woman coming down the corridor. She stopped a few paces from me and smiled. She was formally dressed, high heels, stockings, skirt to her knees and a white blouse. I thought she was going to say something, but she didn‚Äôt. She stared at me and seemed to be summing me up, committing me to memory, then she turned and walked away.<br><br>BASE<br><br>44 looked up as I came in.<br><br>‚ÄúAt night, after 22.00, no need to go back to a rest area, you can always come back here‚Äù<br><br>The last couple of hours were quiet. Just before I logged off Lily Palmer came in. I wondered if she ever went home,<br><br>‚Äú28T can you come in at midnight tomorrow so you can see the last shift‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br><br>A day to myself, although I would need sleep. I rode off home happy.<br><br>Mum was strange today. Sitting in the kitchen reading some crap magazine and having meaningless conversations with me. I think she wants to talk about Messidor but doesn‚Äôt want to raise it. I chatted about the shifts I am doing to learn the job. She nodded and could have butted in but didn‚Äôt. I wonder whether it‚Äôs the money thing, which of course so far I haven‚Äôt got.<br><br>Slept a bit in the afternoon.<br><br>Mum went to bed around ten and I lazed around. At 23.00 I went down to the bike wearing a long tee shirt. I had my snacks and drinks in a small rucksack.<br><br>It was a warm night, not like last night. I pushed the bike down to the road. It was deserted. The most obvious thing to do was to ride to work naked, so I pulled the tee shirt off and set off. I shot across the main road, nobody to see me, then headed down the cycle path. The rush of the air and the physical activity had the usual effect. I hoped that I wouldn‚Äôt see anyone coming the other way. In the distance was a man walking his dog and having a surreptitious fag. I sailed passed him and I don‚Äôt think he noticed me, or if he did he paid no obvious attention. I peddled faster and the endorphins kicked in, I was grinning. My nipples were rock hard due to the excitement and the flow of the air.<br><br>As I neared Messidor I stopped. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should ride past the gates naked. I decided against it in case I would get de-meritted.<br><br>For once there was no Lily in the hallway. 44 was sitting in the shower room reading a book. She smiled when she saw me.<br><br>‚ÄúHey Tango, ready for the graveyard slot?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSure, who is with me?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúLooks like it‚Äôs 82. You‚Äôll like her‚Äù<br><br>I pulled off the tee shirt and stuffed it in the Tango locker then dived into the shower for the usual ablutions.<br><br>‚ÄúHey 44‚Äù she looked up ‚Äúyou were talking about being naked more‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI cycled here naked today‚Äù<br><br>She laughed.<br><br>‚ÄúDid you come through the gates that way?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, wasnt sure if it was OK‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood decision, probably an excuse for a de-merit‚Äù<br>‚ÄúApart from extra hours what are the penalties for de-merits?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAll I‚Äôve ever got is the hours, dunno‚Äù<br><br>At that moment Emma, my neighbour came in.<br><br>She grinned a huge grin when she saw me.<br><br>‚ÄúHey Tango, I heard you were with us, it‚Äôs you and me until about 6.00. Boss wants me to take you through the shift pattern, which is mainly boring. You logged in?‚Äù<br><br>So I logged in and sat with 44. Emma joined us, her neckband was 82.<br><br>Once the evening shift had gone 82 got some coffee from the machine and sat with me.<br><br>‚ÄúHow is your Mum taking you doing this?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWeirdly‚Äù I shook my head ‚Äúshouted at first but calmed down a bit when I told her about the money‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShe was incredibly rude to me when she found out what I did. Makes me laugh to think her daughter is now a Mail Girl‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot yet‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh they‚Äôll offer you a job Tango, you‚Äôll take it won‚Äôt you?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSure‚Äù<br><br>Emma stood up and walked to the bin with her empty cup. She was short but slim, brown hair and very bouncy boobs. I think she saw me looking.<br><br>‚ÄúTits a bit of a problem, running hard they do get uncomfortable. Your boobs much better, enough for a jiggle but not enough to slow you down, right?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWord is you are a fast runner‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI run to keep fit‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGet paid to do it now, just have to do it nude‚Äù she giggled.‚ÄùAlthough you‚Äôre probably not finding that a problem‚Äù<br><br>My MMU buzzed<br><br>B4c2>A63<br><br>I sprang up<br><br>‚ÄúDo legal never sleep?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNope, them and finance usually our main customers‚Äù<br><br>I was out of the door like a flash and down to B, through the door and up to the fourth floor. Lights were on in some of the pods. I stopped at c2 and stood in position. The man working there looked tired.<br><br>‚ÄúEvening, or should it be morning.‚Äù He handed me the package.<br><br>Quick sprint back to A then up to the top floor. The whole place was in darkness so I padded silently round to 3 and put the package on the desk next to the keyboard. The MMU confirmed delivery. My time was, as usual, comfortably below nominal.<br><br>Emma ran a couple of routes and then I got<br><br>D5a12>B2c11<br><br>IT floor 5 was busy, lots of pods illuminated. I ran up to a12. As I moved a shout went up<br><br>‚ÄúHey guys it‚Äôs Tango‚Äù<br><br>There was a ragged cheer and a couple of people, men and women stood up to watch me. I had that surge of nerves and excitement. I felt good.<br><br>At my collection pod I stood and waited. There was a chubby guy there. He looked up at me<br><br>‚ÄúMorning Tango, got you learning the graveyard have they. Welcome to IT, the only place worth coming at 2 in the morning.‚Äù He handed me the package ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if the ...wads in Finance can work with that.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you sir‚Äù<br><br>As I headed off someone shouted<br><br>‚ÄúThanks for coming Tango, you‚Äôll help me get through the night‚Äù and another ragged cheer went up<br><br>At B2 only one light was on and as expected it was c11. I ran up and stopped. The frazzled looking man gestured at the desk, I put the package down and MMU released me.<br><br>Back at the showers I sat down with 82.<br><br>‚ÄúIT were lively‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, can be amusing, they are by miles the rowdiest bunch up here, and they often are working overnight. They are harmless though. It‚Äôs the quiet suits in the other buildings that are the creepiest, but I suspect you know that already‚Äô<br>‚ÄúYeah, sort of noticed‚Äù<br><br>At five o‚Äôclock 82 said<br><br>‚ÄúOK routine job next. Come on‚Äù<br><br>We went out into the hallway. A number of boxes had been set out, each labelled with a building code.<br><br>‚ÄúPaper route‚Äù 82 said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do A together then we can split them up‚Äù<br><br>She grabbed a Messidor bag and stuffed packages into it. Then we went up to 6. Before we popped out of the service stairs she opened the bag.<br><br>‚ÄúEach senior person get free papers. Each package has a location on it‚Äù she showed me ‚Äúyou give them to the textile if they are there, which they sometimes are, but usually I leave them on the chair‚Äù<br><br>She gave me a batch and I walked around the floor putting them on the seats. Nobody appeared to be in residence.<br><br>‚ÄúEveryone gets one on the top floor but on the other floors it‚Äôs usually just one or two senior people. Generally the top dogs are in aisles a or c on the window side. Some like to be near the lift, others the opposite end‚Äù<br><br>We dished out the papers through A quickly. The building appeared to be deserted apart from us.<br><br>82 gave me D,E &F to do. There were about 10 papers to deliver. I ran down to F and quickly delivered 4 there, including one to Jackie Whitten who had an office, not a pod.<br><br>Then to E. One manager was in. He hardly looked up when I walked up, taking the paper from me and tossing it straight into the bin.<br><br>I was a bit worried about D, the IT mob. One of the papers was for a manager on D5, where I had been earlier. I stopped outside the door from the service stairs, then decided to do the manager on C first.<br><br>So back to D. Deep breath and in. I‚Äôd got maybe 20 paces into corridor a heading for pod 16 when they spotted me. It was a woman‚Äôs voice<br><br>‚ÄúHey guys tango is back‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYo‚Äù someone shouted<br><br>I sashayed down the aisle with a little bounce of my hips.<br><br>‚ÄúBrightening up our day again Tango‚Äù<br><br>The paper delivered I turned and headed back. I could see that there was a reception group at the service door. As I passed the big guy I had collected from before he shouted out.<br><br>‚ÄúChaps, with an arse like hers she gets to leave when she wants to, serious, give Tango some room‚Äù<br><br>The group sort of dispersed, making a corridor and I walked through. I could hear murmuring back in the room as I hit the stairs. I turned the corner so I was out of sight of both floors and started rubbing my parts. I usually liked something in my vagina but the clit was all I needed I came very fast with a total knee buckler, much quicker than normal. I stopped and squatted down for a moment as the contractions receded. I was sweating and I could feel heat in my face. I stayed there, naked on the stairs, at work, just having had an orgasm. What is this job? Then shook myself out and went back to 82 in A.<br><br>Just before we logged out Lily came in.<br><br>‚ÄúTango, can you be at Miss Whitten‚Äôs office at 15.00 please‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes Ma‚Äôam. Do I have a shift tomorrow‚Äù<br>‚ÄúJust go home and be there at 15.00, in uniform and logged in please‚Äù<br><br>Outside Emma stopped me.<br><br>‚ÄúI think they are going to say you have passed training Alice. Everyone is saying you‚Äôre a natural. Doing the job is easy provided the nudity doesn‚Äôt put you off. I suspect far from putting you off it‚Äôs a reason to carry on, correct?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI guess, but don‚Äôt tell my mother‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúNot going to do that, it would be too much like talking about myself. You OK with this? You can ask for more time before you sign you know‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, this is good fun, better than doing some boring admin job or working in a Messidor shop‚Äù

      At 15.00 I was in the standing pose outside of Jackie Whitten‚Äôs office, naked of course.<br><br>I realised that I was making a big decision. I could, at this moment, just go back to A, put on my clothes, such as they were, and go home. I would get a few days of pay at Messidor minimum wage. My mother would want me to do just that, although quite what she would suggest I do for the next few years, apart from the general ‚Äúgo to uni‚Äù I had no idea. We had no money to finance much of a life for me.<br><br>That was supposedly the easy route.<br><br>My problem was that staying here was actually the easiest decision for me. These last few days had been the most enjoyable days I could remember since carefree days as a child. The actual work was easy intellectually, challenging physically and exciting psychically. The continual movement on the daylight shifts was outstanding, and the flood of hormones released created a beautiful experience. Naked I always felt 20 times more alive.<br><br>Also the erotic charge of being totally naked in front of the textiles was something I didn‚Äôt think I could recreate anywhere else with the same degree of safety. The textiles were doing their work; their daily hum drum jobs. A beautiful naked women, like me, would go by and for a moment their boring existence would be exposed for what it was. I was doing something very different and enjoying it, and my physical naked presence told them that. My work might be simple and conforming but everything else about me was about freedom. Naked I carried no identification of the commercial world apart from those things necessary for my tasks, which were of course physical tasks, involving my body.<br><br>Jackie Whitten came out of her office.<br><br>‚ÄúTango, come in‚Äù<br><br>I followed her in, she went and sat behind her desk.<br><br>‚ÄúShut the door please‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br><br>I adopted the standing position.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice, you can relax‚Äù<br><br>I was puzzled by this change. I stayed pretty much in the position.<br><br>She smiled at me.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve called you Alice because at this time you are not a Mail Girl, subject to MG code. You can walk away from here having spent a few days living a different life. If you wanted I can call one of the other MGs to go and collect your clothes. I suspect that wouldn‚Äôt constitute very much however.‚Äù<br><br>I grinned.<br><br>‚ÄúOr you can sign the documents I have here and then you will just be 28 for the next few years, on and off, when on Messidor premises. I say that because we are only too happy to take you into the MG programme. The deal is exactly the one that I showed you before‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you Ma‚Äôam‚Äù I relaxed<br>‚ÄúTo be clear however you will be ours during your vacations subject to time spent on academic work and a reasonable holiday. That won‚Äôt be months travelling Europe, it will be the standard Messidor holiday entitlement. In addition you must, even while at Uni maintain your body shape and looks so as to be available to us if needed and agreed. If you do leave without our consent before the completion of this contract any bonuses paid have to be repaid. Most obviously this would be the signing on bonus. ‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes Ma‚Äôam‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWithin these documents are various waivers, the most obvious is nudity but also you agree not to complain if, for instance, pictures or film of you on Messidor business appear on any form of media‚Äù<br><br>I must have looked puzzled<br><br>‚ÄúI think you know we take action if a member of staff releases pictures taken here at work. But if that should happen by accident, before we can stop it, you agree to take no action. If at some stage Messidor wanted to publicise the MG programme you would agree to us using your image. The usual rules of confidentiality apply as much to you as anyone else employed here‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>‚ÄúIf you need time to think you are free to take these home. The offer remains open for 48 hours. If not accepted then the terms may well differ, not to your benefit.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôll sign now, thank you‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBefore you do is there anything that you want to ask, you can ask as Alice‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her. She was wearing the jewel encrusted necklace. I realised that it looked very similar to my necklace.<br><br>‚ÄúYou often wear that necklace, is it an MG necklace?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúUsed to be‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou were a Mail Girl!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIf a firm wants to use the Hirotomo system, and ours is heavily based on theirs, then Hirotomo train the prospective manager, in my day that was in Tokyo‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou become an MG to be the manager?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThey argue that you cant manage an operation unless you can do it yourself. So that means that all MG managers worldwide are women and all have been an MG during their training‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh, so did you do it in Japan?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI did, but some girls have gone from here to be managers‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo all MG managers are attractive women who have run around an office naked?‚Äù<br><br>She smiled.<br><br>‚ÄúThanks for the compliment 28, yes when we meet for the annual conferences we are quite a sight‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her in a new light.<br><br>‚ÄúEver do runs here?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat would be inappropriate‚Äù she said severely.<br>‚ÄúOK, I note that you called me 28, not Alice. I suppose I better sign the paperwork‚Äù<br><br>Once signed up I was taken to the HR body mapping location where MOS scanned me. Quite spooky, it generated a picture, not a photograph although the image was very realistic. I was fascinated to see my vulva very accurately reproduced. I wondered if there was a picture of Jackie in the same detail on a system somewhere.<br><br>Once finished I was released and almost immediately I got<br><br>C4c12>A6.8<br><br>Important job I guessed. Off I went on my first run as a full time MG. As I kneeled at the rest area on A6 another MG I didn‚Äôt know kneeled next to me, she punched me in the arm and grinned.<br><br>‚ÄúWelcome to the gang 28‚Äù<br><br>All day and into the evening every time I saw an MG they smiled or high fived me. At one point in C I saw 32 coming down as I was going up.<br><br>‚ÄúSod the nominal‚Äù she said and gave me a huge hug, all squeezed boobs and both of us feeling arse cheeks, then she spun away. I carried on up feeling particularly excited. The textile with the job gave me a long look, my nipples were hard and he could probably see that, I knew I was flushed. As I set off I could feel his eyes studying my bum, well it is one of my better features.<br><br>Lily had told me to work a shift through to 23.00, which seemed fair. At 19.45 I got<br><br>MAILA>#<br><br>Cant complain, I‚Äôm now totally at MOS command. I collected the small number of last minute packages and headed at a brisk trot down the campus. The old guy in the post room seemed to ignore me, no comments. Outside I stopped. It was a warm night and I felt the breeze over my skin.<br><br>I sauntered back up the slight hill to A. I was happy. Being naked left me continually ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô. It somehow focussed all energy on myself, a narcissistic feeling, at all times thinking about myself and how I looked.<br>

      My schedule magically appeared on my phone each week, with updates, if required, daily. I started the first week on the 16.00 to 24.00 shift. This shift meant that I got a busy late afternoon and early evening period followed by the easier later evening work pattern. During the busy period staffing levels were increased by MGs working overtime or MGs working demerits.<br><br>Surprisingly quickly I got used to running the routes, an operation which was supposed to be sexless from our point of view. I realised that being naked amongst fully clothed people wearing business clothes and working at their desks was an inherently sexual process.<br><br>Somehow we were expected to be modest, to the extent that we could be when naked. Quite how we were supposed to balance this modesty with sexuality when showing our breasts and vagina to any passing textile was not addressed. I am sure all MGs were sexually excited by the constant display the job entailed, it was an unspoken part of the fabric of the Messidor Mailgirl relationship. That tension was part of the attraction of the lifestyle, certainly to me.<br><br>Another thing that I slowly began to realise was the effect of my total exposure to daylight on the runs between the buildings. I got a positive charge each time I went outside, particularly in the summer with a strong sun. The pleasure that I would normally get from lying in the sun on a beach was supercharged by my total nudity. The change from artificial light in the buildings to natural light outside gave me a kick each time, the longer the run the better.<br><br>In contrast to the general modesty rules, the showers in the A Basement were an opportunity to make show, we were encouraged to display ourselves. As Tango I‚Äôd been using a shower without a video camera, now that all changed.<br><br>So it was that on my first regular day I arrived at 15.30 and quickly stripped off. To be honest all that required me to do was take off an oversize tee shirt. Then having grabbed the soap, shaving kit and lotion I headed for the shower.<br><br>82 was there and she saw me going in to the cubicle.<br><br>‚ÄúGive them hell 28; this is probably your best chance to top the charts‚Äù<br><br>Music was pumping and I lathered my body whilst dancing with my best dance floor bump and grind. Then after washing off the soap it was down onto the seat in the shower for the shave. Now I was used to doing this, but without the eyes of various corporate masturbaters. I took a deep breath and began. The pubic area quickly done then down to outer lips. Thighs wide apart, lots of pulling about to check stubble removed followed by a quick checking of the skin around my anus. Rubbing of clit hood was hard to avoid, even if I had wanted to.<br><br>Out of the shower I applied lots of lotion until my body shone under the lights.<br><br>Last bit of prep was a naked stretch out, ready for the running.<br><br>As the clock ticked down I logged on and sat on the bench under a standard, non Tango locker.<br><br>At 16.00 the MMU buzzed in to life and I was away.<br><br>That first afternoon on a normal shift I zig zagged back and forth over our 6 buildings. I spent time on the mats and had a lot of attention from various textiles.<br><br>For instance, I had to do a delivery to my audience on D5. As I came out of the service door I was aware that lots of eyes were facing me. Probably waiting to see which MG turned up.<br><br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 28, the new love of our life‚Äù someone shouted. I jogged along the corridor making my boobs jiggle rather more than normal, doing a very subtle hip swing hoping my arse was also showing a nice tight wobble. I did the drop off and headed back to the rest area.<br><br>A couple of the IT geeks came and stood near me as I knelt down there.<br><br>‚ÄúSo we get 28 as our special MG‚Äù one said<br>‚Äú Definitely prettiest, nicest hair‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd probably best arse on the team‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot to mention very lick-able vagina‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThink you‚Äôll find that‚Äôs technically her vulva. The vagina is the bit your cock goes in, the lips are vulva‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat the f**k, lickable c**t‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNeed to be in on time when she‚Äôs on the morning shift, don‚Äôt want to miss the shower‚Äù<br><br>At which point the MMU buzzed to interrupt this weirdly flattering discussion of my body. These guys were treating me as an object, as if I was somehow absent. But the fact that they saw me as separate from their existence was part of the protection inherent in the MG system. I was both annoyed and turned on by this.<br><br>Later in that first week I started getting a lot of plus jobs.<br><br>One afternoon I was standing in the stairwell getting my breath back on SD when another MG stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúF**k me 28, you are quick on the plus jobs, you need to slow down a bit or that will be all you do‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIs that a bad thing?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell not if you are going for the Olympics but you will get worn out, that‚Äôs what happened to the last speed merchant we had‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her. I wondered if I was causing problems by being so fast; was I a Mustang Sally.<br><br>‚ÄúIs it an issue with the others?‚Äù I asked, worried.<br>‚ÄúF**k no, if you want to run all the plus jobs all it means is the rest of us just battle with nominal. But you don‚Äôt want to pick up an injury‚Äù<br><br>I thought about injuries. Doing the runs wasn‚Äôt too much of a problem. I realised I needed to watch going straight into a fast run without warm up.<br><br>One afternoon I found myself on a mat with 32.<br><br>‚ÄúMOS knows about this, it monitors us through the sensors in the neck band and the MMU. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd get a plus run as first job on the shift‚Äù she said<br>‚ÄúOh cool‚Äù I thought for a moment then had a naughty notion.<br>‚ÄúWhat if we stop to give ourselves‚Äù I paused ‚Äúsome relief‚Äù<br><br>She turned to me and gave me the big eyes.<br><br>‚ÄúI guess MOS will know what you are up to, heart rate, breathing, maybe temperature. All that and no actual movement. Depends if it‚Äôs a big O or a little O‚Äù she thought for a moment ‚Äúso who do we ask?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGood point, who?‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me with that serious look Erica had. The one when I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was joking or not.<br><br>‚ÄúHey Lilly, does MOS record when we stop to rub one out?‚Äù She said, breaking into a giggle.<br>‚ÄúOr Ms Whitten, are orgasms on duty a de-merit?‚Äù I added ‚Äúmaybe I could ask my fanclub on D5?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúJeez that‚Äôs a quick way to de-merits.‚Äù She gave me the eyes again ‚ÄúMaybe you and I should do a mutual one day‚Äù<br><br>At which point my MMU sent me away. Does MOS listen to us?<br><br>One evening, around 21.00 I got<br><br>B3a01>A6.1+<br><br>Shit, something from legal to John Vaux‚Äôs office and a rush job. Top speed across the darkening campus and a charge upto 3. Package straight way available so at speed down again, being careful not to stumble on the stairs then at top speed back to A and upto 6. Across the stylish central area, being careful not to disturb the water coolers, coffee machines and expensive plants and upto Vaux‚Äôs office.<br><br>The door was wide open and I stepped in. He was in the middle of a meeting with 5 or 6 senior managers. He looked up and smiled<br><br>‚ÄúAh, 28. Speedy as usual‚Äù he reached out and took the package. I expected the MMU to release me, but it didn‚Äôt.<br><br>He looked me up and down, I was flushed and breathing heavily.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is why I love the MG programme‚Äù he said staring at me but addressing the others ‚Äúlook at this beautiful young woman, not an inch of spare fat, getting her breath back after hard physical exertion.‚Äù<br><br>He dropped the package on the big meeting table and came and stood next to me.<br><br>‚ÄúLook up Alice please‚Äù<br><br>I did. Because he was now standing next to me all eyes in the room were on him, and me.<br><br>‚ÄúThese managers have never experienced the joys of running naked through the evening light. But look at them, they are thinking about it now, just by looking at you. They will think about you again later, in a quiet moment.‚Äù He turned to me. My MMU buzzed ‚Äúenjoy the warm glow of your exercise and your beauty Alice‚Äù<br><br>I glanced at my MMU which read SD. I walked out of the floor onto the stairs and sat down.<br><br>I was sexually alive. Bloody hell John Vaux knows my name, he is showing me off to his managers. I could feel all those eyes on me, eyes that Vaux had directed to look at me. My nipples were erect and I could feel myself warming down there. I reached down and felt the moistness. Is this how you go up the charts?<br><br>So the charts.<br><br>The charts had no impact on our pay but of course encouraged competition between the girls.<br><br>Any of the textiles in the 6 buildings could, through their computers, access cameras pointing at the shower cubicles, lockers and general areas of the changing rooms in the A basement.They decided what to watch. But there were no recordings generally available and the system did not allow them to locally keep anything they had watched. If they wanted to enjoy the show they had to be at their desks to see it live. Not surprisingly, and by design, the buildings were usually quite full by 8 in the morning.<br><br>MOS knew which changing room and shower cameras were most requested and from that the basic chart was established. Once I was on the system I was number 1 for a while. The others told me a little grudgingly that scoring high was normal for new girls.<br><br>Also at any time of the day the textiles could access the Random Mail Girl (RMG) feed. Using its own logic MOS would pick a Mailgirl and show us moving around doing our job or kneeling on a mat. The video feed came from the cameras which routinely covered all parts of the buildings and grounds, although it didn‚Äôt show the stairs. Again the textiles couldn‚Äôt record the feed and had no control over which MG was on show. I know from seeing their work screens that many of the textiles had the RMG feed on screen all the time in a small window. It was a little disconcerting to be walking down an aisle and realising that I was on RMG and could see myself moving on their screens as I passed.<br><br>Disconcerting and a huge turn on.<br><br>Finally there were in house chat rooms, like a local Facebook. MOS could discover which MGs were most discussed and the tone of the discussions. Some of it was positive, good feedback from users. More discussion was pretty filthy with fantasy discussions about us and our bodies. MOS monitored all of this.<br><br>We didn‚Äôt see the detail but on our schedules, on our phones, we could see our percentage rating and where we stood on the charts.<br><br>What about the plus jobs.<br><br>The other fast MG was a lady called Lita, number 12. She was a small wiry woman in her late 30s. Pretty with short cut hair. Very much the runner, athletes body, no boobs to speak of. Lita was our oldest MG but still popular and a very fast runner.<br><br>We were kneeling together one day and I said to her.<br><br>‚ÄúThey keep telling me I‚Äôm the plus girl, but I am nothing compared to you. You are way faster than me‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, but I am not permanently in the top 3 on the charts with a percentage over 90%. You may not be as fast as me but you have the looks. Would be nice one day if the ...ing textiles would notice me as a piece of ass rather than as an athlete.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúReally?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI used to get the looks and as a result get the excitement, if you know what I mean‚Äù she glanced at me ‚Äú but now whilst I love the running I am thinking of giving this up‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh no‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlice, this is a young girls game. We do a proper job shifting paper securely around these buildings, but we all know that we are also here to provide a wonderfully sexual backdrop to boring corporate life. I think I may have aged out of the second role‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAre you clear of bonus payback?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGod yes, I‚Äôve been at this for enough years. My only worry is that if I stop I‚Äôll start running around the streets naked to get my charge‚Äù she giggled. ‚ÄúStill there is a naturist gym in town and I may have to join that‚Äù

      Relations with the textiles were massively variable.<br><br>Building B, Legal were one of our major clients, hardly surprising because they had documents that needed reviewing or signing by others in Messidor. We were needed to move those documents around the campus.<br><br>Because I was frequently doing plus jobs and because most textiles have very limited access to that service I regularly found myself serving the senior lawyers on B6. Legal clearly think themselves above everyone else at Messidor. Most of the men I dealt with either completely ignored me or gave me a sneering look. This was a practiced view. The boss of legal had been in the room when Vaux did his piece with me at the big meeting and I know how the legal guy was drinking in my sweaty body. Also they are so stupid up there that they think we cant see RMG floating in a window on their screens. Presumably they all go out with supermodels so don‚Äôt need to check us out!<br><br>The women were different. Some clearly hated the MG concept. I did wonder why they stayed, given Messidor's clear support for the product. I would arrive at a desk to be greeted with<br><br>‚ÄúMorning slut‚Äù or ‚Äúoh here‚Äôs the slapper‚Äù and similar. This hovered on the unacceptable but it was pain free so I ignored it.<br><br>Some of the others had a much more nuanced approach. Quite a few always gave me a good look when I arrived, the sort of checking out women do of each others clothes. I found this amusing. My boobs are my boobs, the same today as yesterday. My parts are what they are. Unless you are checking for signs of arousal those lips look the same today as they looked yesterday. I am sure my bum got a going over as I left.<br><br>A few were friendly. One of the nice ladies once gave me a package and said<br><br>‚ÄúLooking good 28, as always‚Äù which was nice. Others would wish me a good day.<br><br>I got the distinct impression that at least one of these prim female lawyers fancied me.<br><br>Finance were similar to legal. There were a couple of guys in finance that were probably virgins. Whenever I bounced up, and for these two I would try a good boob bounce, they didn‚Äôt know where to look. Eyes guys, always best place. I‚Äôm not allowed to bite.<br><br>The Finance women were similar to the legal ladies.<br><br>I‚Äôve something special to say about IT and someone in particular in E but across the other buildings there was a general acceptance and possible joy in the MGs. Obviously the Messidor mods to the Hiromoto original were now a Messidor product and the business was generating a profit from this activity. Treating us badly was hardly good corporate behaviour but I rarely felt that the reaction I got was particularly forced. I suspect that those who ignored me would have done the same if I was a male teenager wearing a postboy uniform.<br><br>One thing we all experienced was the butter fingered textile. He, it was always a he, would manage to drop the package on a pickup and expect us to bend down to get it. This level of schoolboy behaviour was easy to deal with. I perfected the Bunny dip, legs together, bend from the knee and reach slightly backward to pick up the item. Some girls got so annoyed at persistent stuff like this they reported it and textiles were disciplined. Their was no rigid rule about pickups but the safest system for them was to leave the package on the desk and we would pick it up.<br><br>IT floor 5 were one of my favourite floors. Initially I was wary of them, they were mainly young, programmers and coders. They had a very casual dress code and erratic work hours. I would hardly ever see them during the morning but in the evening and night they would come alive. It seemed to me that I got more jobs on that floor than the other MGs. Could be coincidence; but they were hackers at heart and MOS was their baby.<br><br>The MG style is to be quiet and modest. Too much humanity coming through led to de-merits, chatting was definitely frowned upon. However I found that I seemed to get away with a bit more on D5 than anywhere else.<br><br>I‚Äôd come onto the floor in the evening and give them a twirl. They knew someone was coming either on a pickup or a drop so they would tend to be watching the door. It‚Äôs distinctly possible that they knew it was me arriving. I could dance down the corridor giving my hips a swing and shaking my boobs. It was risky but it never seemed to get back to management. Or if it did, management didn‚Äôt mind. The floor always behaved themselves and were supportive, lots of shouts of pleasure but they stayed back.<br><br>I soon gathered that the big guy I‚Äôd first run into was the effective leader of the gang, even though there were managers over him. The women on this floor tended to the indie or grunge look. Gutter chic I have heard it called. I always got the feeling they somehow supported me and probably the other MGs. They liked to think of themselves as rebels in the heart of the Messidor beast and the MGs were certainly a group of rebels. This was of course hypocritical, both the coders and the MGs were part of Messidor design, perhaps part of some grand Vaux scheme, and taking the Vaux coin.<br><br>Now the lady in E.<br><br>First time I noticed her was on a shift she had come and inspected me on the mat. Not in a disapproving way at all but with a smile.<br><br>I saw her a few times on daytime runs and she always looked up and watched me as I went passed. In the evening however it was different. She always seemed to be working late if I was doing the middle or graveyard shifts. She always took time to give me a definite once over.<br><br>Then things escalated. I was on the mat in E and suddenly she appeared, not on her own floor. She walked very slowly passed me then looked around and presumably having satisfied herself there was nobody about went into a pod overlooking the rest area. She stood there for a little while, arms resting on the pod and leaning over. One hand then disappeared and it looked to me as if she was wanking. Fortunately the MMU sprang to life and I was off.<br><br>A couple of nights later, close the end of the shift, I delivered to an empty desk on her floor. Again I went to the mat and she followed me over. Then to my complete surprise, she started stripping. Off came the white business blouse and dark skirt. She was wearing plain neutral coloured bra and pants, nothing too fancy. She took them off and placed them neatly on a desk.<br><br>‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to look at your beautiful body we should be on equal grounds‚Äù she said<br><br>She stood in front of me naked. She had nice boobs, certainly a bit large for MG work. Broad hips, but not excessive and a completely bald pubic area. I sort of nodded without thinking.<br><br>She then started walking up the aisle back towards her pod. I could see her by her pod in the standing posture, then she jogged down the aisle, tits bouncing, and fell onto the mat in the kneeling posture.<br><br>‚ÄúYou are not supposed to be on this mat‚Äù I whispered<br>‚ÄúWho cares. Who is going to stop me‚Äù<br><br>She reached down and separated her lips and stared playing with her clit.<br><br>‚ÄúYou can go now 28‚Äù she said. I ran out and down the stairs. I wondered whether I should report this. I knew I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong, I was sort of a victim.<br><br>I assumed MOS would be aware of this but the next night I was heading into E and up the stairs when to my surprise or even shock she was on the stairs naked. She stood back to let me by then followed me to the drop off. Then I headed to the mat and like before she joined me.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is such a turn on‚Äù she panted, out of breath, clearly not very fit<br>‚ÄúYou cant do this‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt say that anywhere in the Staff or Mail Girl rules, I‚Äôve checked‚Äù she turned and looked at me, she was clearly excited ‚Äúmutual wank 28?‚Äù<br><br>I got up without comment and ran back to Base.<br><br>The next day when I logged on a message came up requiring my attendance with Ms Whitten.<br><br>‚ÄúSo 28‚Äù she said ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you report this woman in E?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt touch me or anything, she may have been breaking Messidor rules but I wouldn‚Äôt know‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell she may have been, although the rules don‚Äôt directly deal with naked masturbation in empty office blocks, I think it is unacceptable‚Äù she gave a weak smile<br>‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt touch me‚Äù I volunteered<br>‚ÄúMmmm‚Äù<br><br>She spun round on her black executive chair and looked out of the window.<br><br>‚Äú4 hours de merits are in my mind but JV wants to talk to you‚Äù I looked puzzled ‚Äúso until that has happened you are still clear. If she approaches you again just move to another building. MOS will know‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHow do I talk to Mr Vaux?‚Äô<br>‚ÄúYou will be summoned to A6.1 as a job‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me closely.<br><br>‚ÄúYou are one of our best MGs 28, you are bound to attract attention, if anything like this happens just tell me or Lily Palmer‚Äù<br><br>I was on the middle shift. When stationery, with no route, I was anxious, waiting for the call. At around 22.00 it came and I ran up to the sixth floor.<br><br>John Vaux was sitting in his office and got up when I came in.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice, I wont keep you long. I waited until now since regular traffic reduces at this time‚Äù<br><br>He gestured for me to sit but I shook my head and remained in standing posture, safer I thought.<br><br>‚ÄúThis lady in E is interesting to me. One day we can talk about my youth and you will perhaps understand. We let you guys run around naked so it seems hypocritical for us to object if our other staff want to do the same, within reason of course.‚Äù<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>‚ÄúThe HR team disagree. I don‚Äôt want to overrule them, I have a constant battle to avoid micromanaging this place.‚Äù He looked at me again ‚ÄúAlice please sit down. I‚Äôm not dangerous‚Äù<br><br>I sat on the edge of one of his big armchairs with my knees tightly together. He looked at me and grinned.<br><br>‚ÄúYou and your colleagues create a sexual charge around these boring offices and we know the MGs improves every measure we can think of for staff performance. As far as HR are concerned the battle is to keep everything in the perfect spot, to achieve equilibrium. If I were younger and working downstairs there would be moments when one of you MGs would, without being aware of it, walk or stand or move in a particular way so that at that precise moment in time I‚Äôm not sure work would be uppermost on my mind‚Äù<br><br>At least he is being honest I thought, but he is just another wanker<br><br>‚ÄúYou know that.‚Äù He looked for agreement from me then went on ‚ÄúI am thinking that maybe we can increase our performance with some fine tuning. Now before we go too far the no touching rules are absolutely sacrosanct. Some female management staff, I think you call us textiles, have asked to work part time as MGs. We wouldn‚Äôt want to do that. If they are doing a good job then we want them to continue doing that job, not wasting time being shit MGs. If they aren‚Äôt doing a good job then we want them sorted out.‚Äù<br><br>That made sense and I grunted agreement<br><br>‚ÄúWhat I want you to think about is this. Could we do ‚Äòfollow a Mailgirl for a shift‚Äô programme as maybe a performance reward. Staff members could choose the shift and it would be interesting to see which shift they choose. Maybe they could choose the MG although I dont want you burdened with too many unfit naked women following you around. MOS could manage that if your friends in 5D put their mind to it‚Äù<br><br>I must have looked surprised<br><br>‚ÄúI know all about 5D. At top level we are interested in the way you react to them and what effect it has on performance.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt anyone tell me, I have been worried that I was about to be hit with de-merits‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlice you are too intelligent to ask that. If you knew it would have spoiled the experiment. You‚Äôll be pleased to know that so far the effect is measurably positive. You can carry on but cautiously please‚Äù<br><br>He gave me one of his deep blue eyed stares<br><br>‚ÄúThink about my idea for a couple of days. I‚Äôll summon you up when I‚Äôm able to think and talk. There‚Äôll be no demerits for today‚Äôs problem, don‚Äôt worry‚Äù<br><br>He touched his wrist and my MMU said Base.<br><br>Relations with other MGs were generally good. We weren‚Äôt all bosom buddies but we were a distinct breed apart at Messidor and stuck together. The only competitiveness between us was the chart, and that didn‚Äôt have any real impact on money or hours or anything else. I was worried that by being fast I might have the effect of bringing the nominals down.<br><br>Emma pointed out that by doing a lot of plus jobs I wasn‚Äôt actually affecting the routine nominals, which was a good thing. Contrary to stories around the internet the system wasn‚Äôt designed to generate de-merits for us. Like all employers Messidor wanted us to be productive but basically contented. Too much pressure and things can go awry, a challenging but achievable balance was the objective.<br><br>One other relationship that I need to mention, 32.<br><br>One late afternoon we were walking away from work down toward the gates, I was with Erica, 32.<br><br>Erica is Belgian. She came to the job almost exactly as I had.<br><br>Her home town was Leuven. Emma told me that when Erica started someone pointed out that her home town was also the home of Stella Artois.<br><br>‚ÄúYes, that is correct‚Äù Erica said<br>‚ÄúSo we could call you Stella‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo that is not my name, I am Erica‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut you come from the same place as the beer so your nickname could be Stella‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut my name is Erica‚Äù she said, a little perplexed.<br><br>From this you might gather Erica has many good points but she does have something of a humour bypass, or at least an English Humour bypass.<br><br>She is, amongst her other talents, an amazing linguist. She speaks Dutch, French, German and English fluently. For Erica fluently means near perfectly. I know she can, in addition, make herself understood in Italian and Spanish. She always says that her ability in language is not special, her country has three languages and it is the English who are unusual because they only speak one language.<br><br>I once said to her that the English think they are doing well if they can order beer in a foreign language.<br><br>‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt going to make a joke about Stella Artois are you‚Äù she said seriously.<br>‚ÄúNo, no. Its a joke about how bad the English are at languages, they think they are doing well if they can order beer in a foreign bar‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut that is easy, most Europeans who work in a bar would understand what you mean by beer because the word for beer in most European languages is actually beer‚Äù<br><br>She then went on to explain that only the Spanish were significantly different because in Spain the word for beer was cerveza. She gave me a serious look as if I should be thankful for the lesson.<br><br>See, humour bypass.<br><br>As we walked out that day she asked me.<br><br>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a boyfriend do you Alice?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo‚Äù<br>‚ÄúStandard for mail girls. Men don‚Äôt seem to be able to handle their women running around naked all day.‚Äù She looked pleased with herself at the joke implicit in the use of the word handle.<br>‚ÄúI guess‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWanna come round tonight and have a few drinks?‚Äù<br><br>I wondered what was actually on offer and quickly said yes.<br><br>Erica lived in a small flat over a shop near me. I cycled round, not wearing much, it was hot. Erica was naked as she answered the door, no surprise for me.<br><br>‚ÄúStrip off 28, play fair‚Äù<br><br>We sat around, nude, chatting about all sorts of rubbish. As the evening wore on we both got pretty drunk. I think we both knew what was going to happen. We were sitting on the sofa and I leant over to her and gently kissed her on the lips. It was like a switch had been thrown. She kissed me back and pulled me down onto her naked body. Immediately I could fell her hands on my bum, pulling the cheeks apart so that the air rushed over my anus and vagina. I lifted my leg over her legs, my parts were now open.<br><br>‚ÄúWhy did we wait‚Äù she whispered.<br><br>I fastened my lips onto her right nipple, teasing it with my tongue. She suddenly pushed me off and I fell onto my back. Her hands were between my legs by now, running her fingers up and down my labia.<br><br>‚ÄúI want to see what the textiles cant see, 28‚Äù she whispered ‚ÄúI want to see all of you‚Äù<br><br>And her head went down between my thighs. Her hands were pulling my labia apart and her fingers running along the crack. I felt her pull my lips apart and then she licked her fingers and started rubbing my clit area.<br><br>She slid up my body and started kissing me, her hand stayed on my clit. I could now reach down to her lips and gently inserted my finger into her wet vagina. Like a couple of teenagers we were quickly mutually finger f**king each other. Locked together our sweaty boobs mashed into each other we thrashed around the sofa. Grunts and yells exploded from both of us. I came in a glorious spasm of pleasure, Erica almost at the same time, jerking her hips into mine we fell apart exhausted.<br><br>I moved down her body, passed her tits, passed her hips and parted her thighs. There was no resistance. I looked at her hairless lips; lips I‚Äôd seen so many times before. I gently parted them now and exposed her inner lips and clit. I bent down and nuzzled her clit hood with my nose then my tongue, moving up and down pushing the tongue into her vagina.<br><br>‚ÄúOh yes‚Äù she whispered. I twisted my body and freed a hand and with my tongue and lips on her clit I inserted one then two fingers into her soft, warm, wet, vagina. She must have remained close because she came very quickly.<br><br>We lay wrapped in a bundle of arms legs tits and vaginas for a long time.<br><br>‚ÄúOhmigod‚Äù I said ‚Äúdo we get demerits for that?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI knew we would end here from the first day I trained you‚Äù Erica replied<br><br>At least two more orgasms later I rode home. I was glad that my next shift wasn‚Äôt until 16.00.

      In time I had told Vaux my ideas about being followed by naked members of staff. He spoke to 32 as well, maybe other MGs and certainly HR.<br><br>Messidor introduced the Guest Mail Girl (GMG) scheme in two broad formats.<br><br>A Messidor staff member could follow an MG for, at minimum, half a shift and at maximum a whole shift, at the time of their choosing. The staff member could indicate which MG they would like to follow but their choice could not be guaranteed. They were told that if they did a whole shift they would probably be moved from one MG to another at the 4 hour break.<br><br>Access to the scheme was either by way of managerial recommendation or by way of charity donations. The charity scheme worked like this; any female Messidor employee from anywhere in the organisation could be a GMG if they raised a certain amount in charity donations. How much they needed to raise was variable and complicated, Messidor took into account location and employee status. Once the employee had raised the money and completed the GMG session Messidor, as a minimum, matched the amount raised.<br><br>Cynics saw this as a way for Vaux to get a broader range of naked women around the offices. That theory might be true but charities benefited from the system. Life is often like that.<br><br>The manager access was at the discretion of each line manager. It could be done as an option to reward good work. It could be used as a confidence booster. In fact there were multiple reasons for manager to recommend staff. The key thing I wanted in the rules, and I know Erica said the same, was that the consent of the employee had to be genuine and communicated to HR direct from the employee, not through their manager. HR had the final sign off.<br><br>During their period as GMG they would be treated a little like a tango. Nothing personal from the shower room but they could be picked up on RMG.<br><br>So here are a couple of my examples.<br><br>Roughly two months in to the scheme I had a lady join me at the half time break on the morning shift. I came back into the shower room and there she was, in her business outfit, standing in the Tango area. That was the system, they checked in with Lily and she would direct them to wait.<br><br>I vaguely recognised the lady. She was tall, brown hair tied up somehow. She wasn‚Äôt routinely pretty but due to her height and her manner she was very striking.<br><br>‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm 28‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúI know, you were requested‚Äù she replied in a somewhat formal manner<br>‚ÄúSo you ready for this‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI suppose so, what do I do?‚Äù<br><br>Her attitude was a little odd, but having done a few of these GMGs I was rarely surprised.<br><br>‚ÄúWell first step is uniform, then shower and stuff‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me with a serious stare.<br><br>‚ÄúAnd stuff?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell, if needed, you shave to be like the rest of the MGs, but if you look good, no worries?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOK, I‚Äôll definitely do the lotion‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou can put your clothes in the locker there‚Äù and I indicated a vacant Tango locker.<br><br>The Tango lockers were bigger than ours, big enough, for clothes to be hung up. Once qualified MGs rarely if ever arrived for work wearing very much, and anything that needed hanging was very unusual. Joggers, tee shirts, simple dresses were the norm. Apart from Daria, if one of us had a hot date and arrived with hot date clothes then the piss was taken with a vengeance.<br><br>The lady slowly and deliberately started undressing. I could sense that decisions were still being made in her brain. I wondered about the consent issue with HR. The rules for us were clear, we could talk but we couldn‚Äôt ask. They had to start any conversation above trivial.<br><br>The bra and pants came off slowly.<br><br>Naked she was very attractive. Her legs were long but fairly muscular, she had broad hips but totally in proportion to her size. She had obviously shaved and waxed as I couldn‚Äôt identify any hair on her vagina, which was nicely proportioned and reasonably tucked away. Her boobs weren‚Äôt big but sat nicely on he frame.<br><br>‚ÄúHow tall are you?‚Äù I asked<br>‚Äú5 foot 10, why?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúLooking good, we don‚Äôt usually see nice tall ladies‚Äù and I grinned at her. She seemed to soften a little.<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm hitting the shower, need to wash off four hours of work‚Äù<br><br>She followed me, tentatively, toward the showers. The other MGs, as is their wont, paid no attention to her, she was a temporary issue, a pop up in their life, soon to disappear.<br><br>She showered and lotioned up vigourously.<br><br>I logged her on with the new GMG setup.<br><br>‚ÄúOK lady, you ready to go?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, lets get going‚Äù she said, but with a hesitancy in her voice.<br><br>The first job was a routine A to B delivery. As always I stopped before opening the door from the stairs for the first time. She looked at me.<br><br>‚ÄúLast chance to change your mind‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúDoes that happen?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot often‚Äù I nodded at her ‚Äúso ready to go naked‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here‚Äù<br><br>Coming out of the door on A4 she hesitated and I sensed she was about to cover up, then straightened up and followed me as I jogged around the route.<br><br>After an hour she was showing signs of fatigue but seemed to be levelling out. We chatted on pads about trivia.<br><br>Then a routine C3 pickup to A4. Nothing special for me but she froze.<br><br>‚ÄúCome on lady, job to do‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my floor‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAh‚Äù we stopped and I looked at her ‚Äúyou knew this could happen, you agreed to this, let‚Äôs do it. Stick to me, look at my back, you are looking great hon‚Äù<br><br>We headed over and out onto C3, one of the Marketing teams. Initially the textile reaction was routine, a few glances but nothing special until someone yelled<br><br>‚ÄúShit that‚Äôs Ruth‚Äù at which point everyone seemed to stand up. Someone shouted ‚Äúnice bum‚Äù. I headed to the pickup and stopped. She came up with me in a sort of hunch.<br><br>I whispered to her ‚ÄúShoulders back, tits out, up straight, you look good and they cant touch you‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me.<br><br>‚ÄúStay focussed on me, they are just random background interference, we are the real thing‚Äù I continued<br><br>Package collected we jogged out, I probably ran faster than normal for the safety of the stairs. When the service door shut I stopped and looked at her. She had flushed up red. Her eyes looked excited.<br><br>‚ÄúF**k me that was so weird‚Äù she said<br><br>‚ÄúLets do the run then we can talk, it you want‚Äù<br><br>On the mat at A4 I said<br><br>‚ÄúSo, how was that then?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúReally strange. Management said I was too uptight to work on C3, too stuffy. Doing GMG was one way to loosen me up, they said‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not normal, but you agreed?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good job, well paid, so yes, I agreed‚Äù she looked pensive ‚Äúand I thought it was an experience that I should try‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her. Her chest was heaving but I noticed her nipples were standing out. She was glowing.<br><br>‚ÄúHow do you feel right now? I asked<br>‚ÄúExcited and turned on. I thought I‚Äôd feel humiliated but once I got over that I realised that I had the power‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way most of us do this work‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI want to go back to C3‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMOS has a way of knowing that‚Äù I grinned at her<br><br>It took about 45 minutes, we‚Äôd done a few runs but MOS asked us to run the reverse, A4 to C3.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôll lead‚Äù she said ‚Äúyou follow‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo issue with that, I‚Äôm your wing man‚Äù<br><br>She‚Äôd had her hair up but quickly she undid it and it fell to her shoulders. She shook her head to spread it out.<br><br>Then over to A4, do the pickup and across to C3. At the door I said.<br><br>‚ÄúYou go, I‚Äôll be a few paces behind‚Äù<br><br>She grinned<br><br>She attacked the corridor. She did the thing on tip toes to emphasise her height and to make her legs even more attractive. She swung her hips like a burlesque dancer. The floor was initially stunned then a female voice shouted out.<br><br>‚ÄúGo for it Ruth‚Äù<br><br>She sashayed up to the desk, dropped the parcel with a flourish then spun round and headed for the mats. Cheers and applause swirled around. I turned and got to the mat first. She came over and in a very theatrical way lowered herself into the kneeling posture.<br><br>A crowd gathered round. I wondered if she could handle this but she was happy in the standard pose. There was a general hubbub of noise and some people were addressing her by name but she ignored them. She leant over to me and whispered<br><br>‚ÄúThat was great, I could get used to this‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBe careful what you wish for Ruth. Those of us who stick at it feel the same, thing is you probably make more than us‚Äù<br>‚ÄúProbably‚Äù her eyes were sparkling<br><br>The MMU very quickly sent us to D and we were gone.<br><br>At the end of the shift we were back in the shower room in A basement. The music was pumping and Ruth was dancing madly about the place, completely naked.<br><br>‚ÄúHey Ruth‚Äù I shouted ‚Äúyou realise that you are on camera, don‚Äôt you‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSure, of course, but this was such a great day I want to celebrate with a dance, join me‚Äù she yelled waving her arms over her head and grinding her ass to the beat.<br><br>I ran to her and we bopped around with the other girls.<br><br>Eventually she slowed and walked over to the Tango locker. I joined her. She reached out and swallowed me in a huge sweaty naked fleshy hug.<br><br>‚ÄúI never believed I could do this?‚Äù she said ‚ÄúI thought I would be too embarrassed.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOnce I got over the nudity I started loving it, if that makes sense‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, what you mean, I think, is once you get over your in built fear of being naked you discover that it‚Äôs actually great fun‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI thought it was OK for you girls, the supermodel Mail Girls‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSupermodel, hey come on‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou know what I mean, young, slim, small boobs, tight arses, pretty. That‚Äôs what most of you are, it‚Äôs OK for you but not for big birds like me. I don‚Äôt mind being naked in the right place but the office was never that place. But GMG says it‚Äôs a non negotiable requirement to be naked so you have permission, you‚Äôve made the decision‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou have a great figure Ruth, different from us but great‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd when I walked out there naked nothing happened, no bolt of lightning. Just people looking and some of them liking what they saw. Nearly everyone wants to be liked‚Äù<br><br>I smiled at her and gave her another hug.<br><br>‚ÄúSo what happens tomorrow, back on C3?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDunno. They‚Äôve all seen me naked now. For the women so what, it‚Äôs just variants of what they have hidden away. For the guys some of them might fancy me a bit more now. One thing, I‚Äôm going to dress a little more sassy from now on. Shorter skirts and a bit more boob. That will be conservative compared to the show they got today‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre happy‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYup, may do it again.‚Äù And she started tearing up ‚Äúit‚Äôs been one of those days that I will remember for the rest of my life. Thank you 28‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlice‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlice‚Äù and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.<br><br>Then a couple of weeks ago I was on the daytime shift. I‚Äôd left the afternoon before so Lily hadn‚Äôt been able to tell me that I would have a GMG with me from the beginning of the shift.<br><br>I rolled into the shower room at around 7.30 to find a naked stranger sitting in the Tango seat. She saw me and her face burst into a huge grin and she ran over.<br><br>‚Äú28, I‚Äôve been waiting for this for months‚Äù She had a strong West Country accent.‚ÄùI‚Äôm Sandy‚Äù<br><br>I looked her over. Petite, slim with a flat stomach and nice but manageable boobs. Pink nipples. She was completely shaved with tucked under vagina.<br><br>‚ÄúMorning, you are quick off the mark‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDont want to miss anything, get the full benefit. I am a charity GMG, I must do 4 hours but if I can do the full 8 then I will get the money matched by Messidor‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh, better get myself fettled and ready to go‚Äù I said, she was infectious.<br><br>I stripped off and headed for the showers, she followed me and copied my morning routine.<br><br>‚ÄúNo need to shave Sandy, I can see you are nice and smooth. I have to do it as part of my duties‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not missing out on any of this‚Äù she giggled and sat legs wide apart foaming and shaving her pretty little vagina.<br><br>‚ÄúSo this tells us where to go‚Äù she said as we sat on the bench at 8 looking at her MMU.<br>‚ÄúWell, it tells me where to go, you follow me‚Äù I smiled at her<br>‚ÄúToday it tells us where to go‚Äù she said, emphasising the us<br><br>She kept up very well. When we have a GMG the system is gentler with us and we don‚Äôt have the same issue with nominals. The idea is that at half way we swop over with another MG and get back to proper productive work.<br><br>About 3 hours in we were jogging across from C to D when she ran ahead and started running around me, laughing.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is so much fun, running around naked in the sunshine and nobody caring‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIf this was your job Sandy, you would care, the clock is running‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut you can go much faster, I know it‚Äù<br><br>On the mat after the delivery she sat with her knees very far apart, showing that pretty pussy.<br><br>‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had a plus job have we‚Äù she stated<br>‚ÄúWhen we have GMGs MOS doesn‚Äôt schedule them for us‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCan you override that?‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her. She seemed eager, her eyes were bright, I knew she was fit.<br><br>‚ÄúI can request that I go onto normal service, with you still following me for the second half of the shift if you want‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh yes‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut it could get brutal‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat, more than this‚Äù and she gestured around us. Some men had gathered for what they no doubt would describe as a meeting just at the end of the corridor in front of us. They were looking at Sandy clinically. I was used to this. With my eyes I indicated them to her.<br>‚ÄúI know, they can look, it‚Äôs a turn on isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúSo how much more brutal?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh not the exposure, not that, the physical stuff‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm good to go‚Äù<br><br>So at midday, after our break, she stayed with me as I went onto normal mode. A plus job came up pretty fast. C5 to A5.<br><br>I ran as if she wasn‚Äôt with me, pounding down the path and up to the fifth floor. She stuck at my back all the way. The package collected we ran the route and after delivery stepped into the stairs for a SD. She was panting but grinning.<br><br>‚ÄúShit that was good fun‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her<br><br>‚ÄúDo you want to be a MG?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot really, I live with my family in Bristol. I don‚Äôt want to move. I‚Äôll go back to work in the Messidor in Cabot Square‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut you are really enjoying this‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh God yes‚Äù<br><br>We must have run four plus jobs in the second half of the shift. She kept with me perfectly. On the last I let her lead and she did it without fault. Running behind her was a turn on, watching her bum move with the peeks of labia between her legs as we ran upstairs.<br><br>Towards the end, after the last plus we were in the stairs at C. She was sweating, glistening in the sun coming through the window. The light catching the hairs on her arms.<br><br>‚ÄúSandy you are a loss to the MG system, you would be a star‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh not like you Alice, that is your name isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah‚Äù I gave a good look, up and down ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure you wouldn‚Äôt beat me on the charts‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to do this, but I am not sure it would be OK with my parents‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDo they know you are here?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSort of, they know it‚Äôs official Messidor charity but if they know exactly what I am doing they are not talking about it‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd you won‚Äôt tell them‚Äù I asked<br>‚ÄúNo reason to have the discussion.‚Äù<br><br>She moved over and wrapped her arms around me, her boobs pressing into mine. I felt her leg lift so her thigh was on mine and I knew her vag would be exposed. I leant down and kissed her and her lips parted and her tongue shot our. Then the MMU buzzed and we parted.<br><br>At the end she hugged me again in the shower room whilst still naked.<br><br>‚ÄúI could so get used to this‚Äù she said ‚Äúbetter get back to Bristol‚Äù<br><br>A couple of days later Jackie Whitten asked me about her. I told her that she was happy in Bristol and didn‚Äôt want to be a MG. I understand that John Vaux doubled the Messier charity money, I guess the RMGs of her would be saved for a rainy wanking day in the upper echelons of Messidor.

      Phoebe was already an MG when I joined.<br><br>She was stunning. Tall with very long legs onto a slim body with nice boobs, quite big for an MG. She had black hair, dead straight hanging down as long as Messidor would allow, just kissing the top of her boobs. Moving around she was always very elegant, never a speed merchant, probably because of the boobs bouncing. She was popular with the textiles.<br><br>Initially, I found her decidedly distant. I‚Äôd smile at her in the shower room and she would seem to ignore me. If I needed to talk to her then no problem but that would be it, no real contact.<br><br>Then someone ran into her outside work and discovered that she wore glasses. We encouraged her to go to Jackie to check it was OK to wear them at work and Jackie had a look at them and said yes.<br><br>Suddenly Phoebe was everyone‚Äôs friend. She told us she had spent her time in a sort of fog with everyone a blur. She could tell us apart but didn‚Äôt pick up on expressions.<br><br>The new Phoebe was funny, lively, always giggling about something or other, would throw herself around in a conversation, as if talking was physical activity. She was great. Strangely the new Phoebe dropped down the charts, it seems the textiles liked the old goddess Phoebe, so she tended not to wear the glasses for runs, but in the basement, they went on straight away.<br><br>Her big thing though was outside of the campus. She lived in a large house by herself. She was married, but her husband was permanently in Tokyo and, according to Phoebe, ‚Äòshacked up with some Japanese tart‚Äô.<br><br>One day we were lounging in the shower room on a break and I asked if her MG job was a problem for her husband.<br><br>‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know. When he left he sent money for the mortgage and I kept my job in purchasing in G . But he stopped sending the money, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to stay on the salary I was getting, so when Jackie suggested Mail Girl to me I went for it‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSo how did it happen‚Äù.<br><br>She leaned back and stretched out those long legs.<br><br>‚ÄúI was in a regular appraisal. My manager asked if I was getting along OK at home, she knew about my husband, and I told her I wasn‚Äôt. I was finding the money side too hard and needed to do something. She said ‚Äòwhy not sell the house, get a flat‚Äô but I told her I really didn‚Äôt want to do that and in any event that meant dealing with my husband.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo she said, get your kit off and be a Mail Girl.‚Äù I interrupted.<br>‚ÄúCome on Alice; you know Messidor, nothing so obvious.‚Äù<br>‚ÄòYeah‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShe said she would speak to HR. I genuinely don‚Äôt think the MG thing would have ever crossed her mind.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut you knew we were up here.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOnly vaguely. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve noticed but the trees, which appear to be randomly spread across the park, actually provide a very impenetrable barrier to the corporate area. They have been planted with a lot of accuracy. From the top of G, which was my building, you could see the tops of the corporate buildings but not much more.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôd noticed that, very subtle, typical.‚Äù<br><br>She shifted her weight, sat up straight and rested her elbows on her thighs. Her boobs very slightly swayed as she did so.<br><br>‚ÄúThe MG thing was confidential, that was the Messidor line. Nobody knew how many girls there were. Initially, nobody knew who any of them were. We‚Äôd see people going up the paths but were they lawyers, marketing, accountants or mail girls. Who could tell.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThey are the ones not wearing much.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut back then they were told to come to work wearing office wear.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I‚Äôd never heard that before.<br>‚ÄúSo the details were a big secret. About a week later I was called up here to F and saw one of the HR underlings on floor 2. Bit more of a chat. She ran through other jobs I could do in G or H, slightly more money, maybe. Not enough for my needs. I must have looked disappointed. So then she said there was an opening in the Corporate area for a Communications Associate. I must have looked puzzled. She pushed across the desk a short job description which included the pay. That was all I could look at. If my eyes could have popped out of my head, they would have. The signing on bonus was bigger than my mortgage arrears. The pay was enough to keep the mortgage company at bay and have a very decent life.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDid you guess at this stage.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, talk about naive. The HR person asked if I was interested. I said ‚Äòobviously yes‚Äô. I was then taken up to F6 to Jackie.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHow did she do it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell things change but as we came out of the lift an MG went by at speed, it was Lita.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWow, they do a STOP now don‚Äôt they.‚Äù I said.<br>‚ÄúBut not then. I was excited and fascinated to see her. Jackie whisked me into her office and she started talking. The package etc etc. My head was swirling with the money, which would solve all my financial worries, oh, and the sight of Lita, naked, running through the office. Jackie then asked if I understood what the job involved, the uniform. It was then I clicked. ‚ÄòThis is a Mail Girl job isn‚Äôt it‚Äô I said ‚Äú so Jackie nodded and said because of my beauty I was an obvious candidate.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúBeauty, Huh, never thought of myself as beautiful.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCome on Phoebs; you are classically gorgeous.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, but who sees themselves as others see them. I knew I had a good enough figure but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo what happened next?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShe asked if I wanted a coffee and I said yes and she went out. I‚Äôm looking at the paperwork and trying to weigh up the money and the nudity. She comes back in and sits behind the desk; she plonks a coffee my side. She asks if I‚Äôm interested and I say yes. Good, she says, so we need to check you are suitable. Please take off all your clothes, she orders. I remember saying ‚Äòwhat here‚Äô and she says ‚Äòif you are going to do this then this office is quite discreet‚Äô which is of course correct.‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me with a grin.<br><br>‚ÄúI think we all get this moment,‚Äù she said<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm not modest. In fact at school I was known for flashing my tits. But this sort of unemotional nudity is weird. Getting undressed for sex is Ok, this was just dispassionate. What was uppermost in my mind though was the letter I knew was coming sooner or later from the mortgage company starting a process that would repossess the house. So the kit came off. I‚Äôm standing there stark naked and she begins a close-up examination. Has a tug at my pubes, which were trimmed but there. She sort of felt my arse which was weird. Then she says ‚Äòexcellent, even more beautiful naked. You would be a positive asset to the programme‚Äô. Then she goes out leaving the door open. I look around and some guy is out there giving me the ogle. I‚Äôm about to do the tits and pubes with my hands then I think, ... it and stay there naked. Jackie comes back and shuts the door.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDid she give you time to think about it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, so I dressed and took the paperwork home. Next morning I‚Äôm in her office signing up.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWho trained you?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSomeone you wouldn‚Äôt know, German girl, went back to Germany, I think she is running an MG operation over there.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúJackie told me that all MG managers have to have done the job at some stage.‚Äù I said.<br>‚ÄúShe told me that‚Äù<br><br>Then my MMU buzzed and I was gone.<br><br>Phoebe‚Äôs big house meant there was always a home for random MGs, Emily lived there for a long time, and it was the site for regular parties either planned or spontaneous. One of those parties I remember very well for its effect on my romantic life.<br><br>It was a planned party. I‚Äôd been at Messidor for around 3 months and most of my friends had made a decision either to forget me or to carry on as if nothing had changed. One boy from school, Deano, had initially dropped me but then he phoned a couple of times to ask me out. I wasn‚Äôt sure so for safety said ‚Äòwhy don‚Äôt you take me to this party‚Äô.<br><br>I had told him it was at the house of someone I worked with.<br><br>When we arrived, the party had taken over most of the ground floor of the house. There were an awful lot of people there, including, I quickly realised, most of the MGs not on duty. Now MGs are inevitably very cute, very fanciable. Deano was fascinated, he kept asking me if this woman or that woman were MGs and I kept saying ‚Äòwho cares‚Äô.<br><br>I began to grasp that he was interested in me not for me, but because of what I did. He probably assumed he would see a lot of naked flesh, or at least a lot of my naked flesh. Eventually I told him I wasn‚Äôt getting undressed for him and if that is what he wanted to get lost.<br><br>He said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve changed; running around naked with all those men watching you has made you a bitch, you know that don‚Äôt you‚Äù<br><br>I just shrugged and he moved away.<br><br>I wandered for a bit.<br><br>I found Erica who was looking bored with a man I didn‚Äôt recognise hanging off her. I leaned over her, ignoring the guy and whispered in her ear<br><br>‚ÄúEnjoying yourself?‚Äù<br><br>She gave me a look, then turned her body towards me and started snogging me hard. The guy with her was both taken aback and engrossed in equal measure. Erica then turned back to him and said.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm with my friend, you can go, ‚Äù and she took me by the hand and we went into the kitchen.<br><br>Phoebe and Emma were sitting on the worktop drinking beer. They laughed at our expressions as we came in.<br><br>‚ÄúIf we are going to have parties I think we either have no other MGs or we face facts and take our clothes off,‚Äù I said.<br>Erica added, ‚Äúmost of the men have come here for that and it‚Äôs a bit annoying.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWe could all get naked, wouldn‚Äôt be a big issue for us, but it would please these wankers,‚Äù Phoebe said<br>‚ÄúLet's do it, but just stay in the kitchen‚Äù Emma suggested.<br>‚ÄúAnd nobody, male or female, can come into the kitchen unless they are in our uniform‚Äù Erica added<br><br>Phoebe was already stripping off and quickly the rest of us followed.<br><br>The effect was slow. Gradually people, mainly men, started hovering around the door. Phoebe‚Äôs kitchen wasn‚Äôt huge but had enough space for the four of us to move around, help ourselves to booze and dance around a bit. One guy said.<br><br>‚ÄúI need more beer, can I come in.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou must be in uniform; you know what that is‚Äù Erica sternly said<br><br>He went away.<br><br>Emily arrived, looked in and grinned and then went away again. Moments later she returned with a tall willowy and pale girl with gorgeous long black hair. Emily said.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is my friend from home, Poppy‚Äù she turned to her ‚Äúcome on Pops, join in.‚Äù<br><br>Emily was stripping off looking back at her friend. Poppy seemed very nervous, sort of biting but not biting her fingernails and fiddling with her hair. She looked at us; we were all smiling at her. Then she slowly took off her trousers and blouse to reveal a slim body. Emily, now naked, went over to her, looked up at her friend and reached around her back to unhook her bra. Poppy was somewhat flat chested. Quickly, without Emily‚Äôs help, she stepped out of her panties to reveal a well trimmed and very black set of pubes.<br><br>‚ÄúOhmigod you are beautiful,‚Äù Emma said.<br>‚ÄúThanks, I can‚Äôt believe I am doing this‚Äù Poppy said in a very cut glass accent.<br><br>Phoebe gave her a glass filled with clear liquid, ice, and a slice. Probably one of Phoeb‚Äôs killer gin and tonics. Poppy slugged it down almost in one.<br><br>Daria looked in. She was dressed in a very classy black dress with gorgeous jewelry.<br><br>‚ÄúYou girls are too much‚Äù she shouted over the noise ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not at work, I stay covered‚Äù and laughing she moved on.<br><br>To liven things up at that stage a naked boy appeared. I knew him from school; he was OK.<br><br>‚ÄúI need to get to the booze,‚Äù he said slowly advancing into the kitchen.<br>‚ÄúYou know the rules, no touching,‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúMight be difficult, a bit crowded in here‚Äù he replied<br>‚ÄúMakes life more interesting‚Äù and I looked down at a reasonable willy ‚Äúand no erections either.‚Äù<br><br>He moved around my back, I felt a slight brush of skin and he made it to the beer. He stood there looking at us all in a very relaxed way, not focussing only on vags, although I did catch him clocking mine and Emily‚Äôs.<br><br>Then the dam broke, more naked men appeared.<br><br>‚ÄúGetting might crowded,‚Äù Emma said and opened the doors from the kitchen into the garden.<br><br>It was a warm night and we stepped outside. Erica took on the police role. Every time a clothed person tried to get into the kitchen she noticed and shouted at them to get out. I was interested that some other girls, not just Poppy and not just MGs were getting naked.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat you need Phoebs, is a swimming pool,‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúShall I ask Messidor to provide one, they are in the catalogue.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúFat chance.‚Äù<br><br>Poppy was standing off to one side, clutching a large probable gin and tonic. I went over.<br><br>‚ÄúSo how are you tonight?‚Äù<br><br>She looked around at me and her face came alive.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is fun. I seriously can‚Äôt believe I did it but now I have, naked is good.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHow do you know Emily?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúFrom junior school on. I live about half a mile from her parents.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDo people in the village know what she does?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúUh, yes, most of them. She has utterly scandalised everyone, and she doesn‚Äôt seem to care.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd you have now joined her.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm not going to be a Mail Girl, I‚Äôm pretty confident about that.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat do you do then?‚Äù<br><br><br>‚ÄúI work in an accountant's firm in Chelsea. Traditional work but I like it. Not one of the big firms, small with high net worth clients.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSounds like it could be interesting‚Äù<br><br>She smiled.<br><br>‚ÄúI live in a very nice recently refurbished house at Kings Cross. It was a brothel before but is now a high class set of flats. My parents bought the flat for me to use for the moment and eventually as an investment for their retirement. I work near Sloane Square. I can get to work in about 30 minutes on the tube or on the bus. The job is paid well and provided I pass the exams I will be an accountant. Unlike Emily I like the work, the people are interesting.‚Äù<br><br>She paused ‚ÄúMaybe I should go to work and strip off, be a Mail Girl for a day, that would cause a stir.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúProbably not advisable.‚Äù I said<br><br>Emily ran over and grabbed Poppy asking her to go and dance. They boogied around the lawn a blur of thighs, bums, tits, and vaginas. Both of them with hair swirling. Poppy was laughing with pleasure. A slow number came on and Erica found me and wrapped me in her arms, skin on skin.<br><br>It finished and she kissed me. Another slow number started and a there was a tap on my shoulder. I looked around. It was Poppy. She grinned.<br><br>‚ÄúMy turn.‚Äù<br><br>Erica laughed and let me go. Poppy threw her arms around my neck. I grabbed her around the waist and pulled her in tight. I could feel her legs up against mine and her small breasts crushed into my not much bigger breasts. She gently kissed me. The song finished. She let go and we both, simultaneously, grabbed each other's bum. I pulled her cheeks gently apart. She slowly disentangled.<br><br>‚ÄúI saw you with Erica and just had to have a go.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt apologise,‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúIt's the first time I‚Äôve slow danced a naked woman, whilst naked myself‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let it be the last; you are good at it.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh dear, visiting Emily is upsetting my karma. This is all new‚Äù<br><br>She wandered off to find Emily.<br><br>Over time the party wound down. Erica was on an early shift the next day and after giving me a huge sloppy kiss, she headed back to her place. I was left sitting in the garden with a large beer winding down. Poppy reappeared.<br><br>‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said ‚Äúget a drink and sit down.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlready got one.‚Äù<br><br>She waved a beer can at me and sat on the bench beside me.<br><br>‚ÄúEmily has taken some chap upstairs,‚Äù Poppy said<br>‚ÄúAre you sharing rooms?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôve got a room to myself.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOK‚Äù<br><br>She turned herself toward me.<br><br>‚ÄúCan I ask you something personal‚Ä¶.private?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou can ask Poppy; I will decide whether to answer.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúEmily is still straight but um, you and Erica, I mean um.‚Äù<br><br>I interrupted<br><br>‚ÄúHave sex with each other?‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúIs Erica your girlfriend?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShe is what is commonly called a friend with benefits.‚Äù<br><br>She looked relieved.<br><br>‚ÄúI mean, are you gay?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, well I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù A question I had asked myself ‚ÄúI think I am what they call bi-sexual. I still fancy some men but now I realise I also fancy some women.‚Äù<br><br>I smiled. She went silent still looking intently at me.<br><br>‚ÄúFor instance I fancy you Poppy,‚Äù I said<br><br>She blushed to her black hair roots. I fancied her even more. I leaned over and kissed her. She kissed me back, moving her body closer to mine. I reached around her and pulled her toward me by the small of her back. She didn‚Äôt resist. I ran my hand down her back to her bum, her legs were slightly apart and I reached in and pressed her anus. She gasped but didn‚Äôt pull away, if anything she kissed me harder and I felt her hand on my left breast.<br><br>‚ÄúPoppy if you want this to go on we need to go somewhere private‚Äù I whispered.<br><br>She broke away, her eyes were excited.<br><br>‚ÄúCome to my room.‚Äù<br><br>I looked around. Nobody was in the garden; there were still a few people in the lounge. I found my clothes in the kitchen and followed Poppy.<br><br>Upstairs the doors to all the bedrooms but one were closed. Poppy quickly went into the open door and gestured for me to follow. She threw herself on the bed. I dropped down next to her, she was on her back and I was to one side. We started kissing; her hands went to my right boob. I reached down, her legs were wide apart and I rested my hand on her vagina.<br><br>‚ÄúAre you sure about this Poppy?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh god yes‚Äù she breathed.<br><br>Still kissing I started gently massaging her vagina with my right hand, I then moved up and started stroking her left breast while kissing her right nipple. Then back to her vagina. As I touched her again, she raised her hips and groaned slightly. I rested the heel of my hand on her pubic areas and rubbed her lips with two fingers, she was wet.<br><br>‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù she whispered.<br><br>I moved around her and parted her legs wide and leaned down to her vagina licking her clit area while still rubbing her lips. She raised her hips again. She was lying back, her arms to each side of her head, spreadeagled on the bed. Her black hair was a frame around her face. She was breathing heavily.<br><br>As I worked her clit with my tongue her hips started moving up and down to emphasise the motion, I brought my hands around and cupped her buttocks to support her. It wasn‚Äôt enough, her head was hard into the bed and she was arching her back, I had to kneel to stay with her. I started ramming two fingers into her hard and she was crying out ‚ÄúOh. Oh. Oh‚Äù and gasping as she did it, bucking her hips up and down ending in a violent orgasm.<br><br>When she finished and fell back onto the bed, I moved down on top of her, still between her legs. She started kissing me hard and pulling me closer, wrapping her long legs around me. I knew what to do.<br><br>‚ÄúJust lie there Poppy.‚Äù<br><br>Kneeling on the bed between her legs I started slowly examining her vagina, telling her how nice it was. I tapped her a couple of times and she smiled. I slid one finger just inside her, then another then took them out and started rubbing her clit hard for a couple of seconds, she began breathing hard again, then I stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúJust getting going, round two.‚Äù<br><br>She was very wet; her legs were almost at right angles to her body, her vagina completely open. I spat on my finger and using that and her natural juices I slid a finger into her anus at the same time with the other hand rubbing her clit area hard. I started ...ing her anus gently while rubbing her clit hard; she began breathing heavily again and gasping and moaning ‚Äúyes, yes‚Äù Then I stopped the fingers on her clit but started licking again. She was going ‚ÄúOh Oh‚Äù and her hips started vibrating hard and fast and her back arched and she came for the second time in a violent jerking orgasm.<br><br>Again we wrapped ourselves together, she passionately kissing me.<br><br>‚ÄúOhmigod, those were the best two orgasms I‚Äôve ever had‚Äù she whispered ‚Äúthe first was fantastic but then a second, even better.‚Äù<br><br>I rolled off her and she lifted herself on one arm. She ran her fingers down my body, testing my breasts and nipples then down to my vagina. She started rubbing it gently.<br><br>‚ÄúYou can go harder Pops, I‚Äôm close, f**king you is such a turn on‚Äù<br><br>She did just that, kissing my boobs and rubbing my clit. I came fast, a nice orgasm. I kept quiet, didn‚Äôt want anyone to know I was there.<br><br>As we lay there, she said.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve slept with boys before, I‚Äôve got a regular boyfriend. They hardly ever made me come. Then this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWomen know what to do; boys are good for other things.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI suppose.‚Äù<br><br>She turned to me and wrapped me up in her arms and long legs. She was clearly about to go to sleep.<br><br>‚ÄúPoppy, I can‚Äôt sleep here, life would get too complicated.‚Äù<br><br>She looked disappointed but nodded.<br><br>I quickly dressed, crept out of the house without anyone seeing and cycled home.<br><br>When I ran into Emily at work a couple of days later, she said.<br><br>‚ÄúHey, Alice did you see who hooked up with my friend Poppy. She almost shouted the house down, must have had at least two massive orgasms. She refused to say anything next morning but looked very pleased with herself.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see her with anybody‚Äù I lied ‚Äúwas she interested in any boys there?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMust have been, kept it to herself though. Given the racket I wouldn‚Äôt mind trying him out myself‚Äù

      ‚ÄúYou may have grasped that the MGs were hardly a normal bunch of ladies. For whatever reason we had all been tempted into the system by money but decided to stay because, in addition to that money, we enjoyed the work. We would mostly arrive at the beginning of a shift not wearing very much because once in the shower room we would soon be wearing nothing, and that was just fine, no point in overdressing.‚Äù<br><br>Daria was different.<br><br>She came from Romania, her English was good but heavily accented. She was small. Generally she wore her dark brown hair pulled back in a long pony tail. She was very slim, almost but not quite flat chested. Naked she was very attractive, well proportioned and until she stood next to me, or particularly Phoebe, she would appear perfectly normal. Beside us her petite size became obvious.<br><br>Being small wasn‚Äôt the thing though.<br><br>Daria would come to work dressed like a model, very classy clothes and full make up. She dressed with considerable care and walking up to A she might well have been a particularly well kitted out and beautiful personal assistant. She never seemed to wear the same set of clothes twice. She would come into the room dressed up and very carefully take off her outfit and fold it into her locker. Once naked she would hit the shower, wash off the makeup, do the necessary lotion and shave and then put on the minimum makeup we were allowed at work.<br><br>At the end of her shift she would shower everything off, put on some more lotion then rebuild her face with full going out makeup, then retrieve her flashy outfit from the locker and head off home still looking as though she was a top level PA.<br><br>‚ÄúDaria why do you do this job when you so obviously love dressing up?‚Äù I asked her one day.<br>‚ÄúThe clothes are what I live for, fashion is my hobby, my obsession‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit weird though, running around wearing no clothes so you can buy expensive clothes‚Äù<br><br>She looked at me as if I were stupid.<br><br>‚ÄúWhen I was working in G I couldn‚Äôt afford these clothes, even with a Messidor staff discount. Working as a Mail Girl I can afford most of the clothes I want. Isn‚Äôt that what Phoebe does for instance, except she wants the money to keep her house. What is the difference?‚Äù<br><br>She gave me a quizzical look.<br><br>‚ÄúBut you can see my point though, all day not a stitch on to be able to spend the rest of the time dressed like a model‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes that is right, what is weird about that?‚Äù<br><br>To which of course the answer was, nothing.<br><br>Daria‚Äôs route to MG was similar to Phoebe. She wanted more money and Messidor offered her a little more in G or H or a lot more as a Mail Girl. Daria said it was an obvious choice for her.<br><br>‚ÄúDid you know about Mail Girls‚Äù I asked her<br>‚ÄúOh yes, by the time I joined they had been in the papers, those articles about how awful it was. I couldn‚Äôt see the problem, all the girls had decided to do the job, nobody forced them.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo you thought this was a way to be a Mail Girl?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNot really, I didn‚Äôt know how that happened, because nobody really knew. But at the HR meeting they showed me the money and I said yes before they got any further.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDid Jackie ask you to strip?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI offered to, I went in and said that I was good for the job and said I‚Äôd show her. She said yes and I stripped off. I signed straight away.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you think about it?‚Äù<br><br>Daria laughed.<br><br>‚ÄúOh yes, for about 30 seconds. I couldn‚Äôt see a reason not to do it. Back home we sunbathe nude on the beaches, I‚Äôve never had any shame about my body, I don‚Äôt see any problems. Anyway it‚Äôs good work, we all keep fit and enjoy flaunting ourselves, yes Alice?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes Daria‚Äù<br><br>It was obvious that G and H were a good recruiting ground for them either directly or indirectly.<br><br>Daria and I worked a very interesting weekend. I wasn‚Äôt due to be on duty but Jackie Whitten specifically asked me to change shifts with Emily.<br><br>‚ÄúIts because there might be a personal issue this weekend for Emily‚Äù<br><br>I looked puzzled.<br><br>‚ÄúYou will understand, Emily knows about it‚Äù<br><br>I wasn‚Äôt doing anything and weekend work paid overtime rates.<br><br>When I got in on Saturday I almost immediately got an A6.1 message. I waved to Daria and headed upstairs. The top floor was busy, which was unusual for the weekend. I went to Vaux‚Äôs office and waited by the door. He saw me and waved me in.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice, or maybe I should call you 28 today, we are planning to complete a big deal with a European company today. Some city lawyers, and the other side, will be turning up shortly. There will be a lot of traffic between Legal and Finance and here.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh good, so we‚Äôll be busy‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIs that a problem‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, usually weekends are boring‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh‚Äù he seemed relieved. ‚ÄúI wanted to warn you and 27 that there will be some non Messidor people around and they may find you um‚Äù he paused ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMight be fun‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBest behaviour young lady‚Äù<br><br>He turned away and MMU said B5a1>A6.1. So we were off. I passed Daria on the stairs and stopped her.<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be busy, there will be some strangers, non Messidor people around, be warned‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo worries‚Äù<br><br>I collected the package and headed back to A6. As I came out onto the floor a group of around 10 strangers were making themselves comfortable in the central breakout area, drinking coffee and eating the fruit. I jogged around the outside and as I did I heard someone say.<br><br>‚ÄúOhmigod, look at that‚Äù<br><br>I smiled inwardly. I was on home territory so didn‚Äôt care. Once the package was delivered the MMU said RESTA5 which was unusual. I suppose they didn‚Äôt want us flaunting our bits resting on 6 but wanted us nearby. Daria was already kneeling there.<br><br>‚ÄúDid you see the outsiders?‚Äù she asked<br>‚ÄúYeah, think I caused a stir‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo did I, they won‚Äôt get much work done if they stop to leer each time one of us appears‚Äù<br><br>Almost immediately she was off and then I got A6.2>B6.a.2+. This was Finance director to his deputy. I ran up onto 6 and round to his office. He saw me and waved me in. A group of strange men and women were there. The conversation stopped dead when I came in, the strangers looked at me very strangely, the Finance Director looked frustrated. He gave me the package and I ran out and across to B.<br><br>By mid morning either Daria or I were on the move most of the time. I was glad of my break and sat in the basement drinking a sports drink and munching an energy bar. Jackie Whitten put her head around the door.<br><br>‚Äú28, a word‚Äù she called me over. ‚ÄúSome of the strangers, mainly but not exclusively the women, are complaining about you and 27‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat have we done?‚Äù I said concerned<br>‚ÄúOh nothing, they just don‚Äôt like the Mail Girl concept‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThey think it is degrading‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that their problem‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWe agree. Please don‚Äôt change your usual work pattern, but please, please ignore any comments‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI always do‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôve also told 27. Just be aware.‚Äù<br><br>I did a couple of runs between A5 and B but the next time I went onto A6 a group of the outsiders stopped as I move around to my pickup. I heard someone say.<br>‚ÄúDegrading to women. Flaunting their bodies. Sexualising the office‚Äù and things like that. I breezed into Vaux‚Äôs office and he looked at me and grinned. He gestured to me. I went over and he leant into my ear.<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the team from the people we are taking over. They‚Äôd rather not have to sell to us and you are making it worse for them‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat should I do‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNothing, carry on as normal. I‚Äôm enjoying it‚Äù<br><br>Late afternoon Jackie caught up with Daria and me on A5.<br><br>‚ÄúGirls the deal is going through but very slowly. Can you two stay on please. You know what‚Äôs happening and it would help enormously‚Äù<br><br>We both nodded. After she had gone Daria said.<br><br>‚ÄúThere is a lovely leather jacket I want, might have the money now‚Äù<br><br>The deal was going very slow. Some high quality corporate finger food magically appeared on A5 next to our place and we could eat, although both of us were up and down all the time.<br><br>The vendor team had settled into A6.4. The Messidor external lawyers were in A6.2 or over in B. Our external lawyers tended to stop each time I appeared but didn‚Äôt say anything. They seemed to be enjoying our arrivals and departures. One in particular kept smiling at me and trying to catch my eye, that is when he wasn‚Äôt studying my tits or vag. Typical corporate type, didn‚Äôt fancy him at all. I remembered what Emily had said about corporate lawyers.<br><br>The crisis, if you could call it that, happened around 20.00. I had just delivered a package to A6.2 when John Vaux stopped me.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice come into my office‚Äù<br><br>The Messidor directors all seemed to be there, but nobody else apart from Jackie.<br><br>‚ÄúThe vendors are talking of walking away.‚Äù I tried to look interested rather than tired ‚Äúit is annoying, we have spent time on this deal and it makes sense to both sides. They have nowhere else to go but they are becoming emotional. Would you help us please?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMe?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt imagine what I could do.<br>‚ÄúI trust you to tell the truth, that is all we want‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOk. Where?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCome with me‚Äù<br><br>He walked out and along to A6.4 where the other side were based and walked in, gesturing me to follow. In the room everyone was suddenly silent.<br><br>‚ÄúYou have some issues, at this late stage‚Äù he said<br><br>A woman stood up, I recognised her, she had been one of the voices complaining all along.<br><br>‚ÄúWe believe we should not sell to Messidor. There are a number of reasons, this poor young lady being one of them‚Äù<br><br>I looked her straight in the eye, tired yes, but poor young lady, come on.<br><br>She turned to Vaux<br><br>‚ÄúYour business is built on Nazi gold. The commune you lived in 40 years ago was funded by Gerhard Stark who was an Nazi scientist‚Äù<br><br>I‚Äôd read this on the web. I had no idea if it was true.<br><br>Vaux smiled in his superior way.<br><br>‚ÄúHe did fund our commune and if you have done your research you will know he actually lived with us. He was a scientist. You know that in the 20s and 30s he created a significant pharmaceutical business based in part on his own research. That business he sold in the late 60s and he retired to our commune. It is true that in the 1930s he, like very many Germans, joined the Nazi party and during the war he helped the German war effort. All of that is true and is common knowledge. This business, Messidor, started in that commune so I suppose to a very small extent what you say is technically correct but grossly misleading.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAll of this‚Äù she waved her hand around ‚Äúis derived from Gerhard Stark‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh please, he died in the late 1970s. Messidor had only just got going as a small, hippy, mail order business. To credit him with our growth is hardly reasonable‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou expect us to sell our business to you, to entrust our workforce to you, a man who employs naked sex slaves in his offices‚Äù<br><br>Ah, I can see my role in this beginning to become clear.<br><br>‚ÄúYou really should do better due diligence. The Mail Girl programme is hardly a secret and you will know the Mail Girl licence is a product from which we derive profit. But you knew that, I‚Äôm sure‚Äù he turned to me, gave me one of his looks then turned back to the woman ‚Äúthis is one of our Mail Girls, 28, you have seen her diligently working all day. Feel free to ask her anything about the Mail Girls‚Äù<br><br>Anything? Oh well.<br><br>The woman stared at me.<br><br>‚ÄúPut some clothes on‚Äù she said to me<br>‚ÄúThis is my uniform whilst at work‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be doing this freely, you are being co-erced‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI chose to do this, nobody made me. I get well paid for doing this as I imagine your lawyers get well paid for doing what they do‚Äù<br><br>I sort of felt Vaux stiffen a little.<br><br>‚ÄúNo women with any shame would work naked in amongst all these men‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd women‚Äù I added.<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be clever with me young lady. You all have numbers not names, like a slave‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIts convenient, as you may know we are linked closely with MOS‚Äù I waved my arm showing the MMU ‚Äúcomputers prefer numbers. Numbers also serve as a form of anonymity for us, not massively sophisticated, but it has that purpose. You must know that staff members are not permitted to touch any of us. If they do they would probably be fired. Offices traditionally have art works, many offices have art galleries attached. We mail girls are a constantly changing art gallery, we are performance art. We move around doing practical jobs but providing a window into a different world for the employees as we work. If we are slaves we are a remarkably happy and well paid group of slaves.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut some of you can‚Äôt leave because of your contracts‚Äù<br><br>Good point. Fortunately my mother had insisted I save my signing on bonus.<br><br>‚ÄúI received a signing on bonus, as did most of us. Mine sits in an investment fund. If I wanted to leave early then yes I might need to pay some of that back. But that sort of signing on bonus is hardly unique to Messidor Mail Girls. If one of the girls has spent the bonus then they might have a problem I agree, but that is a personal choice for each girl.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut you are naked‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThe girls were naked in Sparta, didn‚Äôt stop the Spartans fighting to keep Greece free and save democracy. Cultural norms change one way and then change back. I am not ashamed of my body‚Äù<br><br>The woman looked frustrated. I realised that I was standing on a fissure between two cultures. I didn‚Äôt know anything about these people but I did know that Messidor was very different. Vaux started talking.<br><br>‚ÄúYour company is not like mine. Your company has been successful in the past, but no longer. If you walk away from us you will need to find another suitor, and I know you have tried, so far unsuccessfully. If you can‚Äôt find a buyer those employees you are concerned about will be out of work. You don‚Äôt have to like me or my company. You don‚Äôt have to approve of this young lady and the decisions she has freely made, this is business. I can save the jobs of most of your employees, that is in the contract as you know. You are making decisions based on your personal morals that will affect the lives of hundreds of your employees and their families. You say I was funded by Nazi money, well I hope none of you drive a Mercedes, BMW, Audi or VW. All those companies helped the Nazis‚Äù<br><br>He looked at her. She remained sternly hostile.<br><br>‚ÄúThis young lady is 28‚Äù he gestured toward me ‚Äúher name is Alice by the way, is going back to her world. I am going back to my room. You people need to make a decision.‚Äù<br><br>He looked at me and cocked his head, I followed. As we walked around the floor he said<br><br>‚ÄúBloody hell Alice, comparing yourself to lawyers was a bit rich, that flipping woman is a lawyer‚Äù he paused and laughed ‚Äúgood stuff though, well spoken, loved the bit about Sparta.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been reading about it‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGo back to Daria. I think we may be in for a night.‚Äù<br><br>We weren‚Äôt. I later understood that the buyers argued about a couple of points, Messidor gave in diplomatically, and the deal was signed. I was home by ten. I slept for about 12 hours.

      Emily was one of the most interesting of the Tangos I trained.<br><br>You would describe her as posh.<br><br>She was small, albeit perfectly proportioned for an MG. Classic English rose look with an elegant nose that revealed a slight hook in profile. Bright eyes and a ready smile. Brown hair centre parted falling to her shoulders. She has a very elaborate vagina, with lips protruding through. Her outer lips large and pronounced, especially given her diminutive size.<br><br>I trained her on the middle shift after she had done three days on the main shift. She was doing well. Life was quiet on the shift, and we sat in the A basement chatting. I was by now interested in how people joined Messidor as a Mail Girl, so I asked her.<br><br>‚ÄúI met Jackie Whitten at a garden party at my parent's house‚Äù she told me<br>‚ÄúA party at your parent's house!‚Äù I was shocked and puzzled<br>‚ÄúMy dad is a businessman, successful although not in Vaux‚Äôs league. He loves to network, and his companies do business with Messidor so having Jackie there wasn‚Äôt totally weird.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo she propositioned her host's daughter?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell yes but in a very subtle way. We have this big house with one of those huge gardens. It was a lovely sunny day, and I was just bumming around out on the lawn. You need to imagine me then, I had gone to Bristol, got a 2:1 in law, done my LPC and got a training contract at a top city firm. Dad helped that last bit, but the rest was all me. I had a parentally approved boyfriend, local minor aristocracy.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSounds boringly perfect, but‚Äù I hesitated ‚Äúhere you are, a Tango.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, by the time of the party I‚Äôd dropped out. I hated the law. It was okay as an academic pursuit, but in practice it was dull and boring. The lawyers I worked with were bad people. Status obsessed and prejudiced, as only the English can be. All they cared about was money and getting on with their careers, which is the same thing. They worked long hours and took drugs to stay awake. If the matter I was on was interesting, all I was allowed to do was photocopy. If I did proper legal work it was on the boring repetitive stuff. So I left. My father was livid, insisted I go back, told me how good my future was, all the usual bollocks‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI can see why he would take that view‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh, so can everyone. I was the pariah of the family. Dad told me that I had to go back to law or repay the thousands he had laid out for the LPC. He thought that would worry me.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI can see Jackie working into that gap.‚Äù<br>Emily smiled.<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rush me. So I‚Äôm at the party, and she starts talking to me. At first she seems to treat me as an entree to Dad‚Äôs world but gradually as I rant on about that world she changes tack. Very carefully she gets me to tell her about myself, about holidays in the Med, my boyfriend and all sorts of stuff.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShe is good.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThe best. By the end of the evening Jackie has told me that if I wanted to repay my Dad in both senses of the phrase she had an idea, Messidor could help. She gave me her card, and I gave her my email address.‚Äù<br><br>A job came up on the MMU, fifteen minutes later I was back.<br><br>‚ÄúWhere were we?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúEmails‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh yes. So maybe two days later an email comes from Jackie with all the Mail Girl financials. She was right, I could ultimately repay my father with the signing on bonus. I spent a day online researching Hiromoto and MGs. I picked up that Messidor and Hiromoto were at the respectable end of the business.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMmm, respectable?‚Äù I said quizzically<br>‚ÄúYou know what I mean. So I emailed and said I‚Äôd talk to her. She arranged for me to come here, put me up in a local hotel, and I came in to see her.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDirectly to her?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù Emily looked at me with a puzzled expression.<br>‚ÄúOK, go on, details.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo I go into her room, and she shuts the door. The first thing she says is‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúTake off all your clothes.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHow did you know? Does she do that to everyone?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúPretty well. The fact that you are here tells me you took them off.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell, I thought, if I‚Äôm going to be a Mail Girl they need to see me naked, and I have to expect that. I‚Äôd shaved off all extraneous body hair already. I‚Äôd been standing in front of the mirror at home and the hotel looking at myself. Anyway, I‚Äôm out of my clothes in a flash. She immediately notices that I have an all over tan and comments that I‚Äôm obviously used to being nude. Which was fair because I am used to it on Med beaches.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnything else happen?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGod yes, at one point I‚Äôm standing there, and there is a knock at her door. She goes over and starts a conversation with some chap. I looked round, and he is practically wanking on the spot.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat always seems to happen as well.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo she offers me the job subject to this training and the review.‚Äù<br><br>She leaned back and stretched her legs. As she did so, I could see her vag. It was a fascinating construction; even I was tidy compared to her.<br><br>‚ÄúDoes you Dad know?‚Äù I asked<br>‚ÄúGod yes, I told him‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhen‚Äù<br>‚ÄúStraight away. He was apoplectic with rage. He told me I couldn‚Äôt do it. I pointed out I was 26 so stuff him. He said I would bring shame on the family. I think I said I didn‚Äôt care. Then he told me he would have a word with Vaux and stop it. He wasn‚Äôt having the directors of Messidor ogling his daughter in the nude. How could he face them in a business meeting? I must admit I hadn‚Äôt thought of that, but it only made me more convinced, apparently I had seriously upset him, for once he wasn‚Äôt in control.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDid he speak to Vaux?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúProbably. I‚Äôve heard nothing, and here I am.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúVaux likes his MGs, I suspect he would have told your father to mind his own business‚Äù<br>‚ÄúPossibly. Mum called me and tried to get me to change my mind. She also said it would be good if I used her maiden name to save Daddy‚Äôs reputation. I told her that at work I was just a number and she seemed happy with that.‚Äù<br><br>She sat up.<br><br>‚ÄúHave you been on a nude beach?‚Äù she asked<br>‚ÄúNot before I started doing this,‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúIt's weird. You go to a nude beach and there are scores or even hundreds of people. You strip off, and there is a very short feeling that everyone is looking at you, but you soon realise they aren‚Äôt.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOr are being cool about looking.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah‚Äù she grinned ‚Äúand then you get on with your stuff. It‚Äôs completely different from this, isn‚Äôt it? On the beach it‚Äôs like us here, both naked, so the fear thing, or whatever it is, goes away. I‚Äôd spent most of the summer on a nude beach in France and was totally relaxed about my body. It‚Äôs all the clothed people here that make this different, scary but fun.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúPeculiarly exciting.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGod yes.‚Äù<br><br>She leaned over to me and lowered her voice.<br><br>‚ÄúMost breaks I have a wank in the toilets‚Äù she whispered<br>‚ÄúVery posh‚Äù I whispered back ‚Äúhad one on the stairs yet?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúChrist no, have you?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, I recommend it.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat if someone comes, if you‚Äôll excuse the pun.‚Äù<br><br>I laughed.<br><br>‚ÄúGot away with it so far.‚Äù<br><br>A couple of nights later I got the Vaux call at 22.00.<br><br>‚ÄúSo Alice how are we?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúVery good Mr Vaux.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôll persuade you to call me John. For heaven's sake Alice sit down.‚Äù<br><br>I sat down. Slightly more relaxed.<br><br>‚ÄúSo how is our Tango, Emily?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúVery good, excellent addition to the team in my view.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúGet on with her?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh yeah, she‚Äôs nice, I like her.‚Äù<br><br>He thought for a minute.<br><br>‚ÄúI want you to do something for me. If I tell you something you must not pass it on to anyone apart from the person I want you to tell, and that includes Erica. Do you promise.‚Äù<br><br>So he knows about Erica, oh well nothing secret here.<br><br>‚ÄúYes, I agree.‚Äù<br>‚ÄòEmily‚Äôs father is a business contact of Messidor.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI know, Emily told me.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh good, saves time, well her father called me up telling me how to run my business and ranting about his daughter not being a Mail Girl. What do you think I said?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúProbably politely told him where to go.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCorrect, although I‚Äôm not sure about polite. He is small fry. Good business connection but can be replaced. He threatened to blacken my name, and I suggested he read my Wikipedia page, which pulled him up short. However I don‚Äôt believe in being needlessly unhelpful. Emily will of course stay but can you tell her, and absolutely nobody else, that Messidor will not reveal who her father is to anyone, either internally or externally. At present the only people who know appears to be me, Jackie, you and Emily. I suggest you strongly urge her to keep the information that tight. I don‚Äôt mind her father worrying but see no reason to do more. Do we have an agreement?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you Alice, ‚Äù and my MMU buzzed BASE.<br><br>I ran into Emily a couple of days later; she was now fully online and out of Tango. I repeated the conversation. She looked relieved.<br><br>‚ÄúIt was the one thing Dad said that struck me afterward, the one thing that might have put me off.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs dealt with,‚Äù I said<br>‚ÄúYes luckily.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúEmily, never assume anything Messidor do is luck.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou could be right, ‚Äù and she ran off taking her gorgeous arse with her.<br><br>On another day Emily ran into a lady who was a particular problem. I was fortunate to avoid her, who knows why, but others tangled with her. She was a property administrator based in E. She apparently didn‚Äôt approve of us and was surly and rude when we had to deal with her, OK you don‚Äôt have to love us, and most of us have reasonably thick, albeit naked, skins. This lady was above and beyond acceptable.<br><br>Emily found me standing on a landing in E on SD; downloading oxygen after a plus run. She stopped.<br><br>‚ÄúI'm on a break,‚Äù she said and sat down on one of the steps.‚ÄùHave you run into that bitch on 4, she sits at b5‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think so, doesn‚Äôt ring a bell, don‚Äôt get much work from E4.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you do all the plus stuff, so you deal with top floor people.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, could be‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnyway, she is a queen bitch. She‚Äôs reported loads of us for one thing or another, Jackie knows all about her. Last week I got an INSP from her‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOoh‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôd reached the landing when I had to return. I got to her and got the Wait then Comply. She orders me to do the pose, so I‚Äôm standing there like a star fish while she starts inspecting me right up close. OK pretty gruesome but I‚Äôm facing into her pod. She was never Mail Girl material, trust me, and now she is old and ungainly. Getting down to inspect my vag was a battle for her and she told me to go further into the corridor and face the window, so I did. With a bit more space the old bag could finally get down to the right level.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDisadvantage of being short Em.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get too comfy, I doubt she could get down to yours either, anyway she does the usual, then does the touch the floor stuff.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou knew that was coming though, surely whoever trained you did that‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah but with Jackie in HR, not brilliant but sort of OK. This time I‚Äôm out in the corridor facing the window, and I‚Äôm about to give anyone behind me a full view of the works, vag, anus the lot. She is standing in front of me but looking over my shoulder, and I could tell there was an audience there from her expression. Nothing I could do so I touched the floor. The old bag ambles around me and seems to take ages to finish.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat were you thinking, did you drop into zombie mode?‚Äù<br>‚Äú I could hear people talking, and stuff and I could feel my heart pounding away. Then I started getting turned on. All those people I imagined looking at my .... In my head there were hundreds.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThen she just said Proceed. I stood up and looked behind me. People were hurrying back to their desks.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHundreds?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNar, ten maybe. So I flounced out onto this landing, right here where I am sitting‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCan I guess?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI just sort of touched my parts, a weird ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry down there it‚Äôs all fine‚Äô which is the worst thing I could do. I was wet and ready. I stroked my clit and knew I was so close that I could risk the stairwell. I gave myself a serious rubbing, fingers into vagina, two fingers on clit and had an eyes into the back of the head big O.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWelcome to the club.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs better than that, it was so good I squirted. I hardly ever do that.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúShit‚Äù and I started looking at the stairs for signs.<br>‚Äú... off Alice; it‚Äôs long since dried up. But Omigod what a beauty.‚Äù She leaned right back, stretching out ‚ÄúDoes MOS know, do you think?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI assume MOS knows everything, safer that way.‚Äù And laughed ‚ÄúWorth getting the old bag to do an INSP again?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI still hate her even though she was responsible for such an excellent finish.‚Äù

      JV started addressing the group.<br><br>‚ÄúWe are targeting Happy Trails. Their holiday business is a competitor of Messidor‚Äôs holiday business and they are logically a good fit with us. The takeover battle is likely to be played out at various levels. We will get attention from the financial journalists, something we are used to. However there is one other potential problem areas‚Äù<br><br>Vaux paused and looked around at the gathered MGs.<br><br>‚ÄúWe have also been told that the MG programme is likely to be brought into play. Happy Trails will no doubt go into the attack over our‚Äù he paused, as if searching for a word, then he looked happy and continued ‚Äúmoral suitability as owners of the Happy Trails business. We have already experienced this sort of issue as 17 and 28 discovered a couple of months ago. You ladies will understand that the UK tabloids will take great delight in running a business story with beautiful naked women as the visuals. Corporate takeovers are usually of little interest to the tabloid reader, but involve the MGs and the story is very different.‚Äù<br><br>He switched on the projector.<br><br>‚ÄúSo we are going onto a low key defensive mode.‚Äù<br><br>A map of the campus came up on the screen.<br><br>‚ÄúThe outer security has been strengthened. We frequently get people trying to access the campus with cameras, trying to get pictures of you. Usually these are voyeurs. They are easily stopped by security who see them coming much further away than they realise. The press are likely to be better organised. As you know we are well screened back here so they may try and bribe existing staff. Please be vigilant, if someone, a member of staff for instance, is acting strange don‚Äôt be the usual cool MGs, report through the MMU immediately.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat if they use drones?‚Äù Sasha asked.<br><br>He smiled an evil smile.<br><br>‚ÄúWe have ways of shooting down drones electronically. No, we are most concerned about bribery and direct personal approaches to you. Ladies be vigilant outside, is someone becoming friendly who previously wasn‚Äôt, have you met a stranger who seems to be interested in your work? That sort of thing.‚Äù<br><br>He paused again.<br><br>‚ÄúOne last thing, and this is something which is temporary only, can you ladies dress like office staff when coming to work. The staff in G and H say they can tell who the MGs are because they are the ones who head up here wearing shorts and tee shirts and yoga pants and sports gear. We must assume journalists will camp by the main gates and try to identify you. I don‚Äôt expect a fashion show but try to look like other staff whilst this is going on. We will put some extra hangers into the basement of this building for your clothes. If any of you don‚Äôt have office wear I can arrange for our clothing purchasers to supply samples for you to borrow‚Äù

      Phoebe and I were sitting in a bar in the middle of Bristol. JV had asked us to come and see an MG at one of Messidor‚Äôs clients.<br><br>‚ÄúUnusual to be working for Messidor, but wearing clothes‚Äù Phoebe commented.<br><br>I smiled. The bar was relatively quiet and we were waiting for the Mail Girl.<br><br>The Happy Trails takeover had, as JV warned us, turned nasty. The main attack, reminiscent to me, turned on the morals of the MG programme. Shareholders at the target company were being asked to balance their financial well being against the evils of the immoral Messidor.<br><br>Apparently well sourced press reports had carried stories reporting sexual and physical abuse of Messidor MGs. These stories had been repeated on national TV. We knew this to be untrue but the press were standing by their stories and the issue seemed to be the way that some users of the Hiromoto/Messidor system were behaving. JV had been pressed in a TV interview.<br><br>‚ÄúMr Vaux you say that no abuses are occurring in your company.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes, all of our Mail Girls are genuine volunteers and none have been illegally coerced or abused.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúBut you say that others, using your product, may be breaking the licence agreement‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes that would be one possible explanation of your story‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSo can you give a commitment that you will be taking action‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, unless investigating is taking action. I‚Äôve been given no proof.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSo you are prepared to allow these women to be abused by your customers‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt what I said. Look we licence the system, the same way Microsoft licence Word. You wouldn‚Äôt suggest Microsoft are liable if a user writes a defamatory news item using Word and this is the same thing‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh come on Mr Vaux, women are being abused‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAnd I promised to investigate‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAnd will you take action?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI will investigate. I won‚Äôt commit to anything until I have full information.‚Äù<br><br>So he had committed to investigate.<br><br>So here we were, investigating. One of the local MGs had agreed to talk, but only to other Mail Girls. JV and Jackie W had decided that this was a job for 17 and 28. The client in Bristol was a high powered financial company called Todmesh Investments. They had a generally poor reputation in the financial world, it was thought they dealt with a lot of dirty money. They operated from a fifteen story office block in the middle of the city.<br><br>Phoebe looked at her watch, our contact was late.<br><br>‚ÄúI hope nobody has got to her‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHow would they know?‚Äù I said<br><br>‚ÄúShe talked to a friend who talked to their version of Jackie‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh maybe‚Äù at which point I saw two women coming in ‚Äúthose two look like they could be MGs‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúTwo!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThey are coming over‚Äù<br><br>The two came over and one asked.<br><br>‚Äú17 and 28?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 28. Drink?‚Äù<br><br>They sat down. When I came back from the bar Phoebe introduced them.<br><br>‚ÄúOK, we have decided at the moment to stick to our numbers, so 28 this is 6 and 9.‚Äù<br><br>I smiled at them and asked‚Äô<br><br>‚ÄúSo which of you were we supposed to meet?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúMe, I‚Äôm 9‚Äù<br><br>She was very blonde in all senses of the word. Quite heavily made up and wearing a short skirt and loose fitting top. Probably around my height with good legs and quite large boobs, especially for braless running.<br><br>The other girl, 6, was also blonde but subtler shade. Much smaller in build but naturally prettier. She had on some nice loose fitting trousers and classy tee shirt.<br><br>‚ÄúI brought 6 along because she wanted to back me up‚Äù 9 explained.<br><br>Phoebe looked at me then said.<br><br>‚ÄúWell why don‚Äôt you tell us about your life first, there are a few things we need to check off at the end, if you haven‚Äôt told us anyway‚Äù<br><br>9 took a breath.<br><br>‚ÄúThe main problem is the demerits and what follows. You get a demerit if you exceed your time, one demerit for each minute or part over the nominal time‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSame with us‚Äù Phoebe said<br><br>‚ÄúBut the nominals are too short‚Äù 9 said with 6 nodding furiously<br><br>‚ÄúHow can that be‚Äù I said ‚Äúthey should be the time that a reasonably proficient mail girl takes.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo‚Äù 9 said shaking her head ‚Äúthey are just random, two minutes for this, three for that. No logic.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAnd they don‚Äôt stay the same‚Äù 6 added<br><br>‚ÄúYeah, one day you get 2 minutes for a delivery and the next day just 1 minute 30 seconds for the exact same delivery. It is impossible to do these times so we are always racking up demerits. We get punishment when we reach 25, which we do, on average, every 2 shifts‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the way it‚Äôs supposed to work‚Äù Phoebe said. ‚ÄúSo what happens when you get to 25.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWe get punished‚Äù 9 said.<br><br>Phoebe and I looked at each other.<br><br>‚ÄúPunished?‚Äù Phoebe asked.<br><br>‚ÄúBasically we get spanked or caned or paddled. What happens with you then?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúExtra hours and loss of bonus. It‚Äôs compulsory overtime and eventually it will affect your pay packet‚Äù I said.<br><br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù 6 interjected in a surprised voice.<br><br>The two of them looked at each other.<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôd heard about that but when we raised it with Todmesh they said it was just publicity, not true, just said to protect Messidor‚Äù 9 said with 6 nodding.<br><br>‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs true‚Äù Phoebe said.<br><br>The two girls sat for a short time saying nothing.<br><br>‚ÄúOK, let‚Äôs get those bastards at Todmesh‚Äù 9 said.<br><br>‚ÄúSo how do these punishments actually work?‚Äù Phoebe asked<br><br>‚ÄúThey are usually done by Miss X who is our direct boss. In our shower room there are tables set up, one with handcuffs and stuff. We bend over the table and she administers the punishment.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúDepends, there aren‚Äôt strict rules but the more often you get to 25 the more you are likely to get.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSo tell me more about this‚Äù Phoebe asked.<br><br>‚ÄúYou get taken to the table by Miss X. The other MGs are in the room, the MG system stops for this, apart of course for the cameras. It also means it is watched by every perv in the company‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhich is all of them‚Äù 6 joked, 9 smiled and went on.<br><br>‚ÄúMiss X decides how you are positioned on the table. Most of the time you just bend over so your head and hands are one side and your arse on the other. But sometimes she uses a different table and your ankles are strapped in, spread wide with your hands strapped on the other side. Lady bits fully on display with this one. Then off she goes using her hand, the cane or the paddle.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHow many hits‚Äù I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúOh usually ten, unless you are particularly bad‚Äù<br><br>Phoebe and I were silent.<br><br>‚ÄúMiss X doesn‚Äôt pull back at all, she hits hard so we end up with red welts over our cheeks‚Äù 6 said.<br><br>‚ÄúAnd you often get her massaging your bum afterwards, she certainly gets off on it all‚Äù 9 added.<br><br>Phoebe looked at me shaking her head.<br><br>‚ÄúThats not all though‚Äù 9 started saying.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat, there‚Äôs more‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh yes‚Äù 9 looked serious. ‚ÄúThe textiles with OS access can award demerits direct‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWHAT‚Äù I said, astounded.<br><br>‚ÄúYes, so on any whim they can add to your total. They ask you to do all sorts of things and if you refuse or are too slow then, ping, there is another demerit‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat sort of thing?‚Äù I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúUsually pose in a particular way whilst waiting for a package.‚Äù 9 said<br><br>‚ÄúThe crab is popular on the top floors‚Äù 6 added.‚ÄùYou lie down on your back, raise you shoulders on your hands then spread your legs and raise your hips so you are like a crab. They love staring at your pussy when you are like that.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAny physical contact?‚Äù Phoebe asked.<br><br>‚ÄúNot really, a pat on the bum sometimes from the top dogs, no point in complaining, Olivia Fisher has no power over them‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúShe is our Mail Girl Manager.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI had my boob squeezed by one of them, Olivia did nothing when I complained and I got multiple demerits over the next couple of shifts‚Äù 6 said<br><br>Presumably Jackie Whitten knew her, I thought.<br><br>‚ÄúOlivia tries to keep things under control but the top floors ignore her most of the time. She is very pretty, I expect they‚Äôll suck her into being a Mail Girl sooner or later, like they do with most good looking girls‚Äù 6 said.<br><br>‚ÄúIf she is a Mail Girl Manager she has been a Mail Girl somewhere, that‚Äôs part of the official training‚Äù I said.<br><br>‚ÄúOh shit, there you go‚Äù 9 said.<br><br>‚ÄúSo 9 how did you become a mail girl?‚Äù I asked.<br><br>She gave a rueful grin.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm married but my husband left me‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSounds familiar‚Äù Phoebe said.<br><br>‚ÄúWe had a house with a big mortgage. I‚Äôd been trying to keep the payments up, borrowing from my parents but it was getting difficult. I couldn‚Äôt sell the house because the sale price would barely cover the mortgage ignoring my arrears and the money I‚Äôd borrowed.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThis does sound a exactly like me‚Äù Phoebe added and she reached over and held 9‚Äôs hand.<br><br>‚ÄúYou have to remember Todmesh are financial services, they found out about my situation. I think they gather intelligence on all the potential mail girls looking for a way to influence them. Anyway I‚Äôm working as their main receptionist, you know the style, good make up, smart clothes and a ready smile.‚Äù<br><br>She had a distant look in her eyes.<br><br>‚ÄúMark Harris comes down with Olivia and Miss X. Mark Harris is the director in overall charge of the Mail Girls. He says they would like a word. I didn‚Äôt know who Miss X was but I did know who Olivia was and I could imagine where this was going. They ask me to come out from behind the desk.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThis is in the main reception?‚Äù I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúYup, street outside, central Bristol. So I‚Äôm standing there and Harris says they have good news for me. They realised I was in financial difficulties and they, Todmesh, have taken over all my debts including the mortgage. So now I owe them all the money, not the building society.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúCan they do that?‚Äù Phoebe asked.<br><br>‚ÄúOh yes‚Äù 6 said. ‚ÄúPerfectly legal, it‚Äôs one of the things I used to do in Legal‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHarris says that provided I take on the new role they have in mind for me they will not pursue any of the debts and at the end of the contract they will write everything off. He has this in a document and he shows it to me. I know what‚Äôs coming next but, lifting the cloud of financial worry from my mind is the one thing in life I desperately wanted. Then Olivia says that they are pleased to offer me the role of Mail Girl, starting now‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúLet me get this clear, you are still standing in the reception area‚Äù I asked.<br><br>‚ÄúYes. Oh, and Harris says if I don‚Äôt take the role they will call in their debt immediately with dire financial consequences for me. I said yes, I suppose in shock. Good, says Olivia, so into uniform now please. I said something like, what here and they said yes. Harris says Now, but louder‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúF**king hell 9, this is awful‚Äù Phoebe said<br><br>‚ÄúSo I start by taking off my blouse, skirt and tights. Now I am standing in my bra and knickers. So far nobody seems to have noticed outside. I‚Äôm hesitating and Miss X springs over with a f**king huge pair of scissors. Like a flash she cuts through my knickers so they fall off and while I‚Äôm recovering from that she cuts my bra off. In seconds I‚Äôm naked. I try to do the hands but Miss X grabs my shoulder from behind and pulls me upright. She is one strong cow that woman‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWho is this woman‚Äù I ask<br><br>‚ÄúShort, stocky not unattractive to be fair, but built like a brick shithouse. She normally wears black trousers and black tops. Jet black hair cut short, probably not natural colour.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSounds wonderful‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHarris comes over to me and starts looking at my pubic area. I‚Äôd shaved off my pubes previously for no real reason. He runs his hands over my pubic area and says that I need a shave. Then he spins me round and feels my arse, spreading the cheeks and then says I‚Äôll be fine. By now there are people outside looking in, phones are being held up. He turns round and shouts at them to f**k off then says to Olivia to take me to HR and do the paperwork‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHow long did you sign for?‚Äù I ask<br><br>‚ÄúTwo years. That was 9 months ago‚Äù<br><br>Phoebe got up to get some more drinks. 9 looked at me.<br><br>‚ÄúSo why do you do this job?‚Äù she asked.<br><br>‚ÄúBecause I like it, its exciting, fun, enjoyable and it pays well. Don‚Äôt you find that about the basic job, not the excesses, the basic job‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI guess I do. Once you get over the nudity it is fun and it is exciting. Do Messidor pay well?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh yeah, better than most other jobs I could get.‚Äù<br><br>6 was looking at me carefully.<br><br>‚ÄúSo how often do you masturbate at work?‚Äù she whispered.<br><br>I laughed.<br><br>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt keep count, let‚Äôs say often‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhere do you do it though‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúUsually in the toilets in the shower room, they have doors if you are shy, some of us tend not to be. I‚Äôve also wanked on the stairs. I‚Äôve certainly done it the moment I get home‚Äù<br><br>She smiled back.<br><br>‚ÄúNo doors on our loos, My name is Jessica, usually just Jess‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm Alice‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI think I trust you‚Äù and she looked at 9 who said.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm Amanda, never Mandy in any way at all‚Äù<br><br>Drinks back, Phoebe introduced, Jess told us about her recruitment.<br><br>‚ÄúI feel like Tom Hanks in Philadelphia. The bastards entrapped me with a vengeance, or at least I think they did. I worked as a para legal in the legal department. I wanted to qualify as a lawyer and working for Todmesh Legal was an obviously good thing to have on my CV. I did low level work most of the time, including documenting the deals when Todmesh took over loans as a lever on staff and other people, not just for MG purposes by the way. I would also get called in to help on the big deals and I did some work on Russian Oligarch files that were highly sensitive. The head of legal is a man called John Charles, typical corporate lawyer. When working on these sensitive files I would find myself in conference rooms with Gottfried Barth. He is the founder of the company and the self proclaimed genius who has built it up this far.‚Äù<br><br>Amanda interjected.<br><br>‚ÄúHe is a total German wanker‚Äù<br><br>Jess smiled.<br><br>‚ÄúI am sure he put me in the frame. I‚Äôd be in the room and a real MG would turn up for a bit of low level humiliation but he would be looking at me, probably imagining me naked. So one day I had to swear some documents for the court, low level formal stuff, nothing mega important. I went out to a local lawyer and did the affidavit. About a week later I‚Äôm in a big conference room with Barth and Charles making notes on some deal and ...ing Harris, Olivia and Miss X turn up. Now I‚Äôm the only possible MG in the room so I thought, f**k this, I‚Äôd always thought if they try it on me I‚Äôm just going to walk out. I didn‚Äôt owe enough on my credit cards for their usual approach to be persuasive. Obviously everyone in the meeting knew because they stop their meeting and Harris takes over‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWho was there‚Äù Amanda asked.<br><br>‚ÄúBarth, Charles, a couple of their arse lickers including Jill Cross from legal. It did cross my mind that she might be in the frame but she is early 30s and not really MG form, got kids apart from anything else. Anyway it was me. Harris makes me stand at the bottom of the table. He says the affidavit I had sworn last week was inaccurate and that I had deliberately amended the figures which meant I had committed the criminal offence of perjury. Now there is no way I would have done that, I worked from the data on screen, but he now produced different data and he insisted it was my error. I can see they had trapped me. He said because of Todmesh‚Äôs reputation they would have to report me unless‚Ä¶..‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúF**k them‚Äù I interrupted.<br><br>She went on ‚ÄúA criminal offence would ruin my future career, even suspicion might be enough. As per their usual procedure they gave me no time to think. Accept the MG job or go to jail, it was my decision according to Harris. I said OK. Then before I could think Miss X just yanks my blouse off, buttons flying. My nice smart trousers are ripped down, the zip gives way and there I am bra and knickers. The scissors come out and they are off leaving me stark naked. The whole thing took seconds. One minute I‚Äôm the smart lawyer, next minute the naked Mail Girl.‚Äù<br><br>I looked at her shaking my head.<br><br>‚ÄúThe worst wasn‚Äôt over. They make me sit on the end of the conference table and spread my legs. Barth comes round first and inspects my vagina. Like a lot of younger women in MG firms I was already shaved, the last thing you want is to suffer is a public shaving.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúBut you thought you would walk out‚Äù I said.<br><br>‚ÄúYes, but this was a back stop. Didn‚Äôt stop that German bastard stroking my labia to check. Olivia is there watching, no protection from her. Then the rest come round and give me a good inspection. I thought Jill Cross might hang back, female solidarity and that but no, she was the worst. She comes round and Harris says we should double check I am smooth so she licks her finger and gives me a good feel, even parts the lips and tries a bit inside.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat a c**t, if you‚Äôll excuse the pun‚Äù Amanda said.<br><br>‚ÄúThen downstairs for the shower and further inspections from Miss X‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúPresumably this is all on camera‚Äù I said.<br><br>‚ÄúProbably on the IT wankfest site.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWe could get it, get our hacker friends to go in‚Äù I was thinking about my fan club in D.<br><br>Jess laughed. ‚ÄúForget it, if they work for Todmesh I probably documented some debt transfers to keep them in line. My Dad, who was an old hippy, used to say ‚ÄòThe man can do anything you can‚Äôt stop him doing‚Äô.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúGood, so lets stop them‚Äù Phoebe said.<br>

      Jackie looked thoughtful. I was sitting on A6 with Phoebe and JV. Unusually we were dressed.<br><br>‚ÄúWe know Olivia Fisher at Todmesh‚Äù she looked at Vaux. He looked puzzled ‚Äúshe trained here on her way to becoming an approved MG manager. She was 88‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOh I remember her, yes‚Äù Vaux said.<br><br>I looked at Jackie.<br><br>‚ÄúYou knew about this?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, what I knew was that she was using a stricter regime, she told me that at one of our regular Manager meetings, but wholly within the licence she assured me. I didn‚Äôt press her, to be honest I didn‚Äôt think it worth enquiring.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt appear the sort of person who would permit this‚Äù Vaux said ‚Äúbut who knows what buttons Todmesh have pushed, that debt transfer thing is seriously evil.‚Äù<br><br>At this moment my big friend from IT appeared at the door. JV saw him.<br><br>‚ÄúJohn, come in. I understand we may have a solution‚Äù<br><br>He shuffled to a chair, he was wearing baggy combat trousers frayed at the bottom, a large tee shirt with some clever scientific slogan and a pair of old Vans. He gave me a big smile.<br><br>‚ÄúSort of. We have tried to hack into their system but it will be very difficult because of the security you had us build in to protect the MGs. Remember the system has only limited connection to the world. They must have modified our system to let them play around with the nominals and give users the ability to charge demerits.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThat would be a breach of the licence‚Äù JV said with a smile.<br><br>‚ÄúNow we do have access to enable us to routinely update their system. Just like any system there can be problems, security issues and useful updates. Most of these can be done without bringing the system down but some, just like on your computers at home, require a restart. So what we suggest is we create a special update for them, one that requires a restart, and we load in a super rigid version of the OS that goes back to default and doesn‚Äôt allow their changes. At the same time we can try and grab their video feed which should be available for at least the last 24 hours or so. After that the OS backs it up outside the system.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt you hackers get that?‚Äù Jackie said with a smile<br><br>‚ÄúMaybe, but they might see us doing it and get suspicious. If we go in on a routine update they won‚Äôt be suspicious until it‚Äôs too late by which time we‚Äôll be gone‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSeems good‚Äù JV said<br><br>‚ÄúOne problem. We have checked and it appears they don‚Äôt bring their system down for the big upgrades anymore. It may be they are aware of the risk and as a result they have simply not complied with routine automated requests to allow the upgrade. I understand from legal that we can‚Äôt insist.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat do you mean John?‚Äù JV said.<br><br>‚ÄúThe last two big upgrades that would have needed a restart haven‚Äôt happened. Missing one could be careless, missing two looks like a decision. I could get one of the team to phone them if you want in case it is an oversight‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, no, not yet. With all the publicity they might be getting worried‚Äù JV said<br><br>Everyone looked a bit deflated.<br><br>‚ÄúHowever D5 have a solution. As you know we occasionally upgrade the MMUs free of charge. We could modify the MMUs and send them down to Todmesh, and ask for the old ones back. The MMUs talk direct to the OS and we could easily insert on the MMUs a command to restart the system. We‚Äôd bury it in a menu somewhere. This would be a very small amount of code, and it could have a timer to make it execute in the middle of the night. All we would then need is one of the MGs to enter the command, the system will check for upgrades on a restart and we can do the OS upgrade, grab whatever and disappear without raising suspicion.‚Äù<br><br>JV looked at me and Phoebe.<br><br>‚ÄúCould we trust your ladies, the Todmesh pair?‚Äù<br><br>We both looked at each other then both shook our heads.<br><br>‚ÄúTodmesh has both of them under their control. Currently they are with us and they would probably do it. The problem is if identified I couldn‚Äôt be absolutely sure they wouldn‚Äôt tell Harris to get some benefits for themselves. Amanda in particular is massively under the cosh financially‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou will recall Olivia Fisher owes us a favour‚Äù Jackie said.<br><br>Vaux grinned.<br><br>‚ÄúShe does‚Äù he said<br><br>‚ÄúI could contact her and ask if she could take one of our MGs to experience her stricter training‚Äù Jackie suggested<br><br>‚ÄúYou could suggest the MG is a problem and you wonder if the stricter regime might be worth testing‚Äù JV was warming to the idea.<br><br>I could see where this was going. JV looked at me, not Phoebe I noticed.<br><br>‚ÄúWhoever did it would need to be in the Todmesh building for how long John‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúLong enough for some video of them to be on the system, less than a full day I would say. They could trigger the restart command as soon as they had an MMU then just go about their business.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhy do we need the video feed?‚Äù I asked<br><br>‚ÄúLegal want evidence that our person has been in Todmesh premises to avoid them claiming its fake news‚Äù Jackie explained.<br><br>JV was clearly thinking.<br><br>‚ÄúHow quickly could we get the adapted MMUs to them?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúTomorrow. I could phone my opposite number at Todmesh and explain what is going on, the cover story obviously, and asking him to collect the old MMUs, swap them for the new and send them back by courier. Once the old ones are back here we can check we have them all and then we know the ones in Bristol are the new ones.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOK get that rolling tomorrow‚Äù JV said. ‚ÄúThanks John‚Äù<br><br>Jackie and JV put their heads together and whispered something. I could guess what.<br><br>‚ÄúAlice we both think you should be our recalcitrant MG.‚Äù JV said ‚ÄúOnce the MMUs are in place Jackie can try Todmesh and if they fall for it you can be transferred for remedial training. You would need to be in their building for a day, that‚Äôs all. We would make sure you get a big bonus and our eternal gratitude‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúGratitude is nice, bonus better‚Äù I said.‚ÄùI dont want to be trapped in that place for more than I need‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll sort that stuff out, if necessary you could just do a runner‚Äù Jackie said<br><br>‚ÄúNaked?‚Äù<br><br>They both grinned.<br>

      They‚Äôd told me to be there at 7.45 and, as is me, I was early. The building was unremarkable, located in the city centre by the water. A fair traffic of people were walking by, heaven knows how many were there when Amanda was taken.<br><br>I was to go into the underground garage and ring the bell on the loading bay, Miss X was expecting me, the Messidor bad girl.<br><br>JV had made it clear I could back out at any time, but I knew he would be at best disappointed and probably annoyed. I might remind him of his old terrorist girlfriend but in the final analysis I was just an MG.<br><br>Anyway this would be an interesting 24 hours. I was testing myself again, pushing the envelope as they say. I took a deep breath and walked into the garage. Over to the left was the loading bay with a ramp leading up to metal sliding doors. There was a bell push to one side. I hesitated for a moment. Final decision time. I thought about Amanda and Jess and the other girls trapped by Todmesh‚Äôs altered system and the use they made of it. No brainer really, I rang the bell.<br><br>I heard a loud metallic clanging inside, nothing high tech here and the door started sliding back. They must have seen me coming because standing inside was MissX.<br><br>No question about this lady, short and stocky. Black trousers, black shapeless blouse, short black hair. Fierce expression.<br><br>‚ÄúYou are 28‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYou are not in uniform‚Äù<br><br>I looked around, I was still in the underground car park.<br><br>‚ÄúSorry ma‚Äôam, i didn't know where the uniform rules started‚Äù I said<br><br>‚ÄúThis is Todmesh property so you must be in uniform. Five demerits, uniform now.‚Äù<br><br>So it starts, I stripped off before she could use any scissors. She marched me through the loading area into the shower room. Other girls were already there including Jess who looked at me quizzically. I slightly shook my head. She looked away.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is 28, she is visiting us from Messidor. She has been a bad girl there so has been sent to us.‚Äù<br><br>She pulled me over to near two tables in the middle of the room.<br><br>‚ÄúWhen you get 25 demerits you visit me here.‚Äù She shouted. ‚Äú get ready for work, shower and shave‚Äù<br><br>I was ok with this, there was no French lotion like at our place but it was in other regards similar. Once I had finished Miss X grabbed me again.<br><br>‚ÄúInspection pose‚Äù<br><br>She subjected me to a rigorous inspection which extended to running her fingers over my labia and anus. I could feel myself moistening.<br><br>‚ÄúYou'll do‚Äù she finally said.‚Äù Your login details have been sent to us‚Äù and she gestured to a standard login screen.<br><br>The MMU was the new model, I was very relieved to see. John from D5 had drilled me on the process over the last few days. The actual command was buried in a menu rarely used by MGs and looking like a dead end. What it didn't say was ‚Äòcrash the system and restart‚Äô although that it what it was supposed to do. I was told to wait until I was alone before setting it in motion.<br><br>The building was organised much like ours. The commands gave a floor and location. I sat down on a bench and waited. It didn‚Äôt take long, I was called to the eighth floor, I was given two minutes. I ran out of the room and into the service stairs. I reached the door to the eighth floor and then stopped.<br><br>I was used to going out into Messidor, it was totally normal to me, but this was totally new. I could see the counter going down, deep breath and in, run to the location, just made it. A secretary looked up, stared at me, then gave me a package. The MMU buzzed with a destination. She didn‚Äôt speak. Fortunately it was down and by rushing dangerously down the stairs I made the nominal, again just. This was madness, I was fast and I could just about do the runs. I headed for the mat which was by the lift. Remembering the basic rules I knelt and stared at the floor in front of me.<br><br>As I got my breath back I wondered how I was going to get the time to run the routine on the MMU. I‚Äôd have to take some de merits next time on the stairs. I was aware that a couple of men were staring at me, new girl I suppose, make the most of me, I‚Äôll be gone soon. The MMU buzzed and I was off again.<br><br>Into the stairs I checked up and down then stopped. Quickly I found the menu and hopefully set the programme running. It would have been nice if the MMU had said ‚Äòthanks Alice‚Äô but all that happened was it reverted to the home screen which showed I had 30 seconds to do four floors. I did my best but picked up more de merits.<br><br>Just after lunch the MMU sent me to the top floor, the place Gottfried Barth hung out. I came out of the stairs and a secretary saw me and waved me into a big conference room. Barth was sitting at one end of the room working on the large table. There was a spectacular view over Bristol behind him.<br><br>He was medium height, thin with a bald head. He had on the sort of wire framed glasses that Germans always seem to wear in TV films. I noticed he was very tanned.<br><br>He was alone. There were papers spread around. He was wearing headphones. In front of him was a large chrome thermos mug. I was surprised there was no laptop but he had two phones off to one side.<br><br>He looked up when I came in.<br><br>‚ÄúAh the new girl‚Äù he said with hardly any accent. He took off his headphones and beckoned me with his finger.<br><br>I walked upto him.<br><br>‚ÄúVery good,‚Äù He tapped the table top. I looked at him with a puzzled expression. Buzz Buzz I felt two demerits hit my phone.<br><br>‚ÄúOn the table so I can look at you‚Äù<br><br>I wasn‚Äôt expecting that, I hesitated and as I did so my MMU buzzed, another demerit. So I stepped on a chair and up onto the table. He was sitting down and I was now towering over him. He was looking up at me, studying me, studying my parts.<br><br>‚ÄúI am the boss around here, you do what I say, do you understand‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes sir‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúGood, sit down on the table‚Äù<br><br>This seemed OK so I sat down keeping my legs together, he smiled.<br><br>‚ÄúSpread your legs, as wide as you can‚Äù Buzz, buzz as I hesitated again.‚ÄùIf you are too slow I give you demerits and we can then all enjoy Miss X dealing with you. Come on.‚Äù Buzz buzz.<br><br>This is what I was here for. Presumably all of this would be on the videos that D5 were going to ‚Äúacquire‚Äù tonight. I spread my legs wide.<br><br>‚ÄúGood girl, now let me see inside of you, open your vagina up, I need to see all of you‚Äù Buzz Buzz Buzz. I reached down and did what he said. I was moist down there, something I imagine he could see. He studied me for a little while then looked at my face.<br><br>‚ÄúYou know something I find very funny, you girls think that we might take pictures of you. Why do I need to do that‚Äù He emphasised the ‚ÄòI‚Äô. ‚ÄúIf I want to see your c**t, inside your vagina, your anus, even your little pearl all I have to do is order you up here and tell you to show me, I don‚Äôt need the images on my computer. I can look at the real you anytime I want.‚Äù He smiled an oily smile ‚ÄúYou can go.‚Äù<br><br>And as if nothing odd had happened he returned to his paper work as I climbed off the desk. I walked out with as much dignity as I could muster. At Messidor we were naked women, maybe art works. Here at Todmesh we were porn stars, that was the point. Their system was set up to deliver demerits allowing the abuse. You did what they said or got demerits.<br><br>His secretary gave me a funny look as I went out onto the stairs. I immediately got 5 demerits, I realised I should have hit the mat so I returned. As I knelt down his secretary mouthed ‚Äòsorry‚Äô and gestured back at him in his conference room.<br><br>The afternoon flashed by in a blur of hard running up and down stairs. I wondered how much they had modified the system, were the nominals the same or did they flex to increase the pressure on the girls as the demerits ranked up. I was suspicious because runs that I thought I could do in the morning became impossible in the afternoon.<br><br>I collected demerits. I was dreading the shower room, Miss X and her tables. I wondered which one I would get, that I would get one of them was a given. I was hoping as a new girl I‚Äôd get an easier introduction.<br><br>At the end of the shift I was sitting in the shower room with all the other girls. There was no conversation. Miss X was moving backward and forward between her office and the lobby area outside talking on her phone. She was shooting fierce looks at the girls as she talked, the impression was that she was talking about us to someone, not discussing a Just Eat delivery with her partner.<br><br>The phone call over she called the first girl up. The girl bent over the simple table and received 10 smacks from the hand. It didn‚Äôt look too fearsome. After it was over the girl thanked Miss X, I noted that. The next girl also bent over the same table but this time Miss X was rather more violent, hitting the girl much harder and leaving red marks on her bum cheeks. The girl yelped as each smack hit and was panting quite wildly as this went on. She received 15 of this smacks and at the end she rather unsteadily got to her feet and quietly thanked Miss X. She seemed breathless as she passed me to sit down. So far Miss X hadn‚Äôt said anything other than to call out the girls number.<br><br>Then she called out 28. I got up.<br><br>‚ÄúThis is the new girl who has come to us from Messidor where she was disobedient. She has been disobedient today with us. We need to show her what happens to girls like her at Todmesh.‚Äù<br><br>To my horror she moved to the other table and she gestured me over. I noticed a paddle resting up against one of the legs.<br><br>Now I realise that a bit of spanking is part of some people's sex life, but it hadn't ever been part of mine. None of the frankly inexperienced boys I had shagged would have dared try it, they were often scared to even touch a real girl.<br><br>Erica had shown no signs of liking it either.<br><br>It certainly wasn't one of my erotic fantasies. So this was pretty frightening. There didn't seem to be much I could do to escape so I approached the table submissively. Maybe she was just scaring me, I thought.<br><br>No, as I got close she grabbed my shoulders and pushed me over the table. Before I could do anything she pushed my legs apart with her feet and reached down locking first my left leg then the right in ankle bracelets attached to the table. Then, very fast, she repeated that approach with my wrists on the other side.<br><br>For the second time that day my legs were spread wide apart with my vagina exposed.<br><br>‚ÄúLet us see how 28 likes this‚Äù she announced with some pleasure.<br><br>She hit me hard with the paddle. I let out an involuntary grunt. It hurt. She had hit me at the bottom of my bum cheeks, where they met my thighs. The second blow came quickly followed by the third.<br><br>Then something started happening. I started getting aroused. The pain continued with each blow but each blow stimulated my clitoris. I know now that endorphins and adrenaline start pumping round the body and coupled to the stimulation to my pussy that was the reason I was somehow enjoying it. I thought that the panting and breathlessness of the previous girl might be for different reasons than pain.<br><br>The blows went on, the pain remained and an orgasm started building. Oh shit, I thought, what if I come right here. Then she stopped. I'd lost count of the blows.<br><br>‚ÄúI think that's enough‚Äù she laughed ‚ÄúI think 28 might be a little slippery‚Äù<br><br>She released my hands then my feet. Unsteadily I stood up, remembering to thank her. I carefully sat down, bum was sore and hurt as I sat on the hard bench, I shifted from side to side to try and get comfortable.<br><br>‚Äú28 you are to stay here overnight, I have confirmed that with Jackie at Messidor. You may get a call on the MMU, if you do you must respond. Don‚Äôt think about leaving us, your clothes will be locked in my office and in case you think of running out naked, like the whore you are, none of the outer doors will open so long as you have the collar on‚Äù<br><br>After she had gone one of the girls went out into the lobby and came back with a pillow and duvet.<br><br>‚ÄúHere, they are clean. She often does this, we are used to it.‚Äù She looked at me sympathetically ‚Äúwhat did you do at Messidor to end up here?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúLong story, I‚Äôm sure you will find out soon enough, don‚Äôt want to talk about it.‚Äù I grimaced ‚Äúmy bum is sore‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúShe is evil‚Äù she looked at me sideways and whispered ‚Äúwere you close to coming?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúDid it show?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSort of, she knows exactly how to do that, she is very good at stopping just before you actually orgasm. Someone said she learned how to do it when she was a BDSM dominatrix‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúMy bum is probably all red‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIt will be, takes a few days to go away. She‚Äôll get you again once you‚Äôve recovered a bit. Tomorrow your demerits will be much lower then it‚Äôll ramp up again‚Äù<br><br>I nodded. Hopefully I‚Äôd be gone by then.<br><br>We‚Äôd planned what JV insisted on calling my extraction over a number of scenarios. Best result was going to be me walking out in the evening, getting back to the hotel and phoning in. We had however anticipated the possibility that I wouldn‚Äôt get out so easily and luckily Messidor would know what was happening because Miss X had spoken to Jackie. Assuming the operating system went down as planned I would be able to get out whilst the system was rebooting and someone would be outside at around that time to pick me up. Lack of clothes was an issue but it would be early morning and hopefully nobody much around.<br><br>I sat on the pillow and drank some water.<br><br>Around 21.00 my MMU buzzed. Top floor. No alternative but to set off.<br><br>Coming out of the stairs I looked around. The secretary wasn‚Äôt at her desk but I could see Barth in the conference room with a large fat man. Barth waved me in. Both men studied me as I walked in. I tried as far as possible to walk very straight, no hip swinging. No deliberate bounce inducing steps. Barth tapped the table, I knew now what this meant so I climbed up.<br><br>‚ÄúTurn around please 28 and get down doggy style‚Äù at this point he became formal ‚Äúsorry I didn‚Äôt introduce Mark Harris, the head of the Mail Girl programme here, amongst other things. So Miss X administered one of her beatings, lets see what that looks like‚Äù<br><br>Both men were now behind me.<br><br>‚ÄúHead on table please‚Äù Harris said. My bum and vagina would now be sticking up in the air.<br><br>‚ÄúNice pretty anus‚Äù Barth said.<br><br>‚ÄúRed cheeks‚Äù Harris said and they both laughed.<br><br>I was aware that the secretary seemed to have returned.<br><br>‚ÄúSarah, come in here please‚Äù Barth shouted out.<br><br>I was amazed to see the smart secretary come into the room. She was naked apart from a suspender belt and stockings and some high heels. She was seriously tall and slim, pretty well flat chested. Her legs, to quote the old line, went up to arm pits. Her hair was long, dark brown and straight, earlier it had been up but now hung down. Her pubes were completely shaven. I imagined that every other young woman in this building had taken that precaution.<br><br>‚ÄúNow Sarah have a look at this young ladies bottom. That is what will happen to you if we have any more disagreements.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYes Herr Barth‚Äù she had a very cut glass accent.<br><br>I looked up from the table at her, without expression she turned and walked back to her desk. The two men were still behind me presumably staring at my undercarriage.<br><br>‚ÄúShe has a nice vagina‚Äù Barth said and in a harsh voice ‚ÄúCrab please‚Äù<br><br>I knew this one. I turned over, wincing as my sore bum hit the conference room table and adopted crab. Harris leant in and tapped my knees to move wider.<br><br>My feelings at that moment were difficult to understand. I was used to nudity by now. I was used to people, even seriously creepy men like these looking at me. This was a level or two up from kneeling on a mat at Messidor.<br><br>But, but, on another plane it was very sexy. They were staring not just at my labia but at the detail of my vagina, that generally only happened as a part of sexual activity. Were it not for the fact that the crab was uncomfortable and my bum hurt I knew I would be getting excited.<br><br>‚ÄúVery pretty, lovely lips‚Äù Harris said and laughed again.<br><br>‚ÄúThank you 28, enjoy your night, sleep well‚Äù Barth laughed and he gestured me to go.<br><br>I walked slowly out. The men behind me were involved in a conversation. I reached the secretary who was typing away in her stockings and high heels. She had sad look. I mouthed ‚Äòyou OK‚Äô. She gave me the ‚Äòcomme ci, comme ca‚Äô hand single and wrinkled her nose.<br><br>The abuse of women in Todmesh was obviously endemic. I wondered what they had on Sarah.<br><br>Back in the shower room I settled down. I didn't want to sleep so every time I nearly dropped off I got up and walked around. The room was a little chilly which helped me stay awake.<br><br>I knew the reset should occur at 02.00. As the time approached I got increasingly nervous. The girl also on duty was trying to sleep and so I paced up and down in the lobby of the loading bay.<br><br>As the time approached I was ready. I watched the seconds tick down on the MMU. At 2.00 exactly the login screen went blank and the MMU reverted to a simple watch face. I tried the neck collar and it simply unclicked. JV had said to leave the collar and the MMU behind so I rapidly hung them up.<br><br>The other MG woke up.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat's happening‚Äù she asked sleepily<br><br>‚ÄúDunno, but I'm off, not staying here with that bitch‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúGo for it girl‚Äù she shouted as I opened the door.<br><br>The loading bay door unlocked easily and I ran out into the garage and up the ramp to the street. I looked around, nothing much going on, quiet night in corporate Bristol. There was some sound from bars over the water.<br><br>Very slowly, and hugging the wall, I crept out. Fortunately the traffic was non existent. In front of the offices the road was deserted, no people and no cars. To my right there was some light from a 24 hour convenience store. I turned to my left into the road running down the side of the building. As I did so the head lights flashed on a car parked opposite and a voice I knew shouted.<br><br>‚ÄúOver here Alice‚Äù<br><br>I ran over and jumped into a Fiesta parked on the water side of the road. Inside was Sandy, who high five‚Äôd me.<br><br>‚ÄúAlways in uniform 28‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNot planned, my clothes are locked up in there.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI'll take you to my place, I've got things you can wear‚Äù
