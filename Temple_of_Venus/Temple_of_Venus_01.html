<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Prologue:</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">It is the year
2039. The world has recovered from the Crisis of the 2020s, and order has been
restored. The Crisis began with a series of economic, environmental, political,
and social disruptions erupting within a span of four years beginning in 2021,
exacerbating each other. A resulting cascade of global incidents and disasters
caused the outbreak of world war three in 2025. After war&rsquo;s end in 2029 new
governments are established in the remnants of the old world and now a new era
has begun. By 2039 the world is rebuilt. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Slavery is now
legal and accepted across the world. Strict regulations regarding the welfare
of slaves are well enforced, and slavery is no longer an atrocity. Slaves are
made in punishment for crime or voluntarily as an escape from poverty. Training
centers turn slaves into valuable commodities. The most common professions for
slaves are agriculture, home servants, and prostitution. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">———</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian turned 13
years old on a rainy night in October. The weather was appropriate for the
occasion. In real life it&rsquo;s rare for the weather to mirror the tone of events
as perfectly as it did on Lillian&rsquo;s birthday. Thunderstorms don&rsquo;t conveniently
happen during dramatic moments, sunny days aren&rsquo;t always happy ones, and rain
doesn&rsquo;t usually mean depression. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Tonight however in
spite of it being her birthday the rain was entirely appropriate for how
Lillian and her mother felt. They blew out her birthday candles together. Her
&ldquo;cake&rdquo; was a pair of store bought cupcakes. One with a number one candle, the other
with the number three candle. Thirteen. It was just them sitting together in a
mostly dark kitchen. Dad was in jail and they couldn't afford a party. Dad
would be sent off to one of the centers to become a gardener or a janitor or
something else, it was only a matter of time. It was his fourth DUI conviction
that got him there. Mom already had the divorce papers finalized, just in time
to celebrate their daughter&rsquo;s birthday.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">If she didn&rsquo;t
divorce him she would have been given the choice to join him, and become slaves
together. That&rsquo;s how it worked. Families couldn&rsquo;t be split apart against their
will, so if Mom had chosen that route Lillian would&rsquo;ve been made a slave as
well. She was a child in the eyes of the law and not allowed to decide for
herself. They&rsquo;d all live in a slave compound together, a happy little family.
Mom would be sent to work as a maid or janitor as well. Lillian might end up
going to the... that one school.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The rain beat down
on the roof of their duplex, the owner of which lived in the other half. He was
a sweet old thing, very kind to them during these troubled times. But the fact
remained that they were very behind on their rent and would likely get evicted
soon. Lillian and Mom sat opposite each other at the small wooden table in the
dining nook attached to the kitchen. Through the sliding glass door beside them
they could see a distant flicker of lightning. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Ooh let&rsquo;s count.&rdquo;
Mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian didn&rsquo;t
join in as her mother counted to thirteen. She trailed off after that, not
hearing the thunder.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Too far away.&rdquo;
She said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian took a
bite of her cupcake. Red velvet, with too much colorful icing on top. It was
the saddest birthday cake in her life.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The night passed
in silence, save for the steady beat of the rain while they ate their cupcakes.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Happy Birthday.&rdquo; Her mother said as Lillian
stood to go to bed. She wasn&rsquo;t tired, but there was nothing else to do. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She changed into
her PJs and flopped down onto her bed. Her Birthday hadn&rsquo;t been completely
terrible, she reflected. Her friends had at least given her some presents and
brought sweets of their own to share at school. She&rsquo;d been taken out to a movie
after school by her friends as well. But as they were leaving the theater she&rsquo;d
been given the news (via text message) that their father was being enslaved for
repeat DUI convictions and Mom had divorced him. That had put a real damper on
her special day.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">As she lay awake
pondering the future her need to sleep was checked by her need to think. She
wouldn&rsquo;t go to school the next day, instead she would be helping Mom pack in
anticipation of eviction. Mom had said that they had a new place lined up, but
wouldn&rsquo;t say where. Lillian hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t have to switch schools.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Finally her need
to sleep so she could function the next day became too much. She had one tool
left to put her into a drowsy state and thus into sleep. She threw back her bed
covers and shimmied her pajama bottoms down to her knees. She had to resort to
the rubbies. That&rsquo;s what she called it. It helped her get to sleep in the past.
She was hardly in the mood tonight, but if it helped her sleep she would try.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Her fingers found
the warm, moist place between her legs. She rubbed her girl area gently at
first, and then more vigorously as she became wetter down there. She knew her
girl area had a more scientific name, and even knew what that name was, but it
just seemed so... weird. Likewise she&rsquo;d heard the real word for the rubbies
before, a long ugly sounding word that started with an M, but she couldn&rsquo;t
remember it. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">It felt good, and
she moaned a little bit as she found the sweet spot with her fingers. To help
her along Lillian pictured in her mind her cousin, Bobby, who she had seen
naked for a moment earlier that year. She felt like she was doing something
wrong, he was her cousin after all, but the memory of his boyhood swinging as
he walked helped her finish. With one final moan she &ldquo;reached the top&rdquo; as she
called it. It worked. She immediately felt drowsy and was asleep a few minutes
later.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She woke the next
morning to Mom walking in unannounced. In her sleepiness she had forgotten to
pull her PJs back up. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; She
complained, quickly pulling a blanket up to conceal her exposed private parts.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s not
like I&rsquo;ve never seen it before.&rdquo; She said. She tossed a stack of flattened
boxes onto the floor along with a tape gun.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Already?&rdquo; She
asked sleepily.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yep, we&rsquo;ve got to
get started ASAP.&rdquo; She answered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian grumbled
as she got out of bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna shower first.&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Without waiting
for permission she pushed past Mom and walked down the short hallway into the
bathroom they shared. She slipped off her PJs and entered the small shower. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She turned on the
water and waited for it to get warm before aiming the nozzle at her body.
Except it didn&rsquo;t get hot. As she waited she realized that the house was
unusually cold. After three minutes with no change in the water she opened the
door a crack and called out &ldquo;Mom, is the heat out?&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yup, gas has been
disconnected. Cold shower for you sweetie.&rdquo; Mom answered from elsewhere in the
house. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian rolled her
eyes so hard they might have popped out of her head. She stepped into the icy
cold spray and winced. She lathered herself up quickly, not wanting this
unpleasant experience to last a second longer than necessary. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">As she rinsed
herself off she noticed something that made her heart stop. On the shelf where
the shampoo and body washes were kept was a camera. A Gopro, half obscured by
bottles, its lens pointing right at her. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She screamed and
slapped at it, sending it and all the bottles flying. She scampered out of the
shower and wrapped a towel around herself, expecting Mom to come running in at
any moment. Except she didn&rsquo;t.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She cracked open
the door again and called out for help.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Sweetie it&rsquo;s
okay, why don&rsquo;t you come out here?&rdquo; Came Mom&rsquo;s voice.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Mom there&rsquo;s a
fucking camera in here!&rdquo; She shouted.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Hey, language! We
have a visitor.&rdquo; Mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Something was
wrong. There was no way her mom would be okay with this, unless she was the one
who put it there. Lillian could scarce comprehend it. Still wrapped in the
towel she exited the bathroom, and made for her bedroom. Mom was in there,
along with a man she had never seen before. They were looking at a tablet
device together, sitting on her bed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian gasped in surprise
and adjusted the towel that hid her nakedness. &ldquo;Who, who are you?&rdquo; She
demanded. He must have arrived after she got in the shower.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Lillian, this is
Mister Reynolds, Mr Reynolds, my daughter, Lillian.&rdquo; Mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor and
a pleasure to see you in person Miss Lillian Harcourt.&rdquo; The man said, extending
a hand.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">He was a thin man,
maybe fifty, with a kindly demeanor, like a grandfather. He wore an old
fashioned suit and a bowler hat, which he removed upon offering her his hand. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Still extremely
uncomfortable and now growing a little frightened, Lillian extended her hand.
After shaking it Mr. Reynolds did not let go, but instead turned her hand over
and looked at it closely. He rubbed his other hand over the skin of her hand.
She yanked it away brusquely.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Lacking in the
manners department, but her skin is as flawless as you claimed, Mrs. Harcourt.&rdquo;
Mr Reynolds said to Mom. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;My skin...?&rdquo; She
asked. Even more so than ever she wished she were dressed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yes, your skin.
Your mother promised me you were beautiful with soft baby like skin, and I
can't say she was wrong on either count.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Mom, who is this
man? Why is he here, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; She asked warily, taking a step towards
the door.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;ve made
a choice for our future, and it&rsquo;s time you found out.&rdquo; Mom said, shifting
slightly. As she did so the tablet she was holding tilted enough for Lillian to
see the screen. It was a live feed. A live feed of a bathroom from the
perspective a camera resting faceup on the floor.<i style=""> Their</i> bathroom. Her blood turned to ice in her veins. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;You, you were
watching me in the shower...&rdquo; She said, hardly able to get the words out.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yes. So now that
you know that we&rsquo;ve seen you naked already, why don&rsquo;t you drop your towel so we
can look at you properly.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said, nodding at the only thing
preserving her modesty. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I, I can&rsquo;t
believe this.&rdquo; She said, hot, angry tears forming in her eyes. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;You told me she
was a smart one, Mrs Harcourt. She is being remarkably dense.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds
said. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Honey, please do
as he says, we can&rsquo;t make a poor first impression.&rdquo; Mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian turned and
left the room as fast as her towel would permit. Normally she would flee to the
sanctity of her bedroom, but that space had been invaded. She had nowhere to
go, she couldn't go outside, her nakedness prevented that. Her only option was
the kitchenette or the small living room. She chose the latter. She sat down on
the tattered sofa and crossed her legs. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She wasn&rsquo;t
immediately pursued. She could hear mom and the strange man talking but she
couldn&rsquo;t make out the words. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><i style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Why</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">
were they watching her shower. Who was Mr Reynolds, and why was he so keen to
see her, a thirteen year old girl, naked. The only reason she could think of
was that he wanted to...</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Oh shit. The
realization hit her like a speeding semi truck. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">No no no. It
couldn&rsquo;t be true, her mother never would, she wouldn&rsquo;t do that. She had
divorced Dad so they could <i style="">avoid</i>
slavery. There had to be another reason. What is was though was a mystery.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She noticed some
papers on the coffee table. She looked at them. One of them was a partially
filled out form titled &ldquo;Voluntary surrender of parental rights and informed
consent of sale of minor child into legal slavery.&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She couldn&rsquo;t
breathe. No, no, no, NO! She flung the form away from her. Underneath it was a
thing that looked like a brochure. She picked it up. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Temple of Venus
school for the art of lovemaking.&rdquo; She read to herself, deciphering the florid
cursive the title was written in. The cover of the pamphlet was a dark
silhouette of a man and a woman standing on a sandy shoreline at sunset,
embracing at the water&rsquo;s edge.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She heard her
bedroom door creak open. She looked up to behold Mom and Mr Reynolds entering
the living room. She was too angry and humiliated for words. They saw her
holding the brochure and saw the surrender document on the floor, and Lillian
could tell they knew that she now understood what was happening. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Mom spoke first.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sweetie, I wanted to tell you sooner, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself
to. Mr Reynolds understands that finding out can be a nasty shock and is
willing to forgive your poor manners. He&rsquo;s one of the representatives of The
Temple of Venus training center, that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;How could you?&rdquo;
Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
simple, really.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said. &ldquo;Your parents are in dire financial and
legal situations, and your mother knew that one of you, you or her, was going
to have to be sold. You, a nubile, beautiful young girl is worth considerably
more than what your mother is.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Please, try to
understand honey, it&rsquo;s not a bad life. I&rsquo;ve read all about this school, they
will treat you well. It won&rsquo;t be forever, just until I can get back on my feet
and make enough money to buy you back. Please, you&rsquo;ll get three good meals a
day, and they&rsquo;ll teach you a profession. It&rsquo;s much more than I could ever give
you, it&rsquo;s the best choice for both of us.&rdquo; Mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Some of Lillian&rsquo;s
anger melted away as her mother began to cry. The tenderness of her words and
the honesty in them made Lillian feel a small pang of sorrow for her mother&rsquo;s
plight rather than anger.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I am sorry about
the shock in the shower. Part of my assessment of potential purchases is
getting candid video of them, so I can see what they look like when they aren&rsquo;t
trying to impress anyone. You impress me, Lillian.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said, a genuine
smile on his face. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other
way?&rdquo; Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that or be
homeless. Homeless are usually rounded up and put into slavery anyway. With the
money I&rsquo;ll get from you I could finally start my own business. My very own.
Imagine it. When I make enough from that I&rsquo;ll buy you back, and then we can be
a family again.&rdquo; Mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;The decision has
been made regardless. I need to know if you are obedient, Lillian. It&rsquo;s the
final box on my assessment. Now, please, stand up and remove your towel.&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds said firmly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian looked at
Mom. With tears in her eyes she nodded. Lillian stood, and let the towel drop.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian tried not
to scream as Mr Reynolds examined every inch of her nubile young body. There
was no lust in his eyes, only a keen appraiser&rsquo;s demeanor. He was looking at
her as if he were assessing the quality of a car or racehorse. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Hmm, emerging
breasts, A cup. Wide hips with well shaped legs. Thin but not skinny. Beautiful
creamy white skin tone, fair. Auburn hair, wavey, shoulder length. Slightly freckled
face. Brown eyes. Thin but visible pubic hair emerging in groin area. Thick,
rounded mons with visible labia and cleft. About 157 centimeters tall, healthy
weight. Turn around.&rdquo; He said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">It took her a
moment to realize he had directed the last part at her. She turned around,
grateful to hide her front from him.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Rounded buttocks,
nicely shaped. Skin on the back is as flawless as the front. Spine, straight.&rdquo;
He concluded.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian remained
facing away from him as Mr Reynold spoke to her mother.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take her.
She is a very sexy specimen, and obedient enough. Manners need work, but that&rsquo;s
what the school is for. You can turn back around, Lillian.&rdquo; He said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She did so, this
time covering her private parts with her hands. Mr Reynolds and Mom sat down on
either side of her on the sofa, and at Mom&rsquo;s urging Lillian sat between them.
She couldn&rsquo;t speak. She just had every inch of her completely naked body
examined by a man who wanted to buy her. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Can I get
dressed?&rsquo; She asked after a minute had passed of Mr Reynolds and Mom discussing
the terms and value of the sale. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian didn&rsquo;t
think about the implications of that question, they were just too horrible. For
what felt like an hour the man and Mom filled out paperwork and decided her
future. When at last it was done the woman who had been her mother had her
check for a very large sum of money, and Mr Reynolds had his new made slave.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Say your
farewells, quickly. It is time to leave.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said after he snapped his
briefcase shut. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Sweetie, I&rsquo;m so
sorry, I had no other choice.&rdquo; Mrs Harcourt said to the girl who had been her
daughter. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian said
nothing. She was surrounded by strangers. At Mr Reynolds&rsquo; urging she stood. Mrs
Harcourt followed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Can I go get my
things?&rdquo; Lillian asked quietly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;My stuff, like my
clothes, my phone, you know?&rdquo; She asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Mr Reynolds
chuckled. &ldquo;None of that belongs to you anymore. You belong to us now. You go to
the school exactly as you are.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Naked?&rdquo; She
asked, horrorstruck. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yes. It is a
reminder of what you are now. You own nothing.&rdquo; He said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian was once
again unable to speak. Mr Reynolds nodded approvingly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fast
learner. From now on you should only speak when spoken to in the presence of
your masters. Failure to do so will be punished.&rdquo; He said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian timidly
walked to the front door at Mr Reynolds urging. When she opened it the cold
autumn air hit her body and her skin erupted into goosebumps. She shivered
slightly, both at the air and at her exposure to the world.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The walk from the
door to the white van in the driveway that Mr Reynolds had arrived in was
horrifying. Every car passing on the adjacent street could see her, every
neighbor she had known for her whole life could see her. Her bare feet objected
to the cold, rough concrete. She was <i style="">naked</i>.
It was with great relief that she climbed into the front row of passengers
seats from the driver&rsquo;s side.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">To her surprise
there was another girl there already, sitting on the passenger side of the
front row. Close to her in age, this girl was blond and ever fairer of skin
than her, with shining blue eyes. She greeted Lillian with a genuine smile and
a wave. She was clothed, wearing a simple white dress that hung to her knees. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;My name is
Amber.&rdquo; She said. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian didn&rsquo;t
answer, she was too confused and upset. Tears were rolling down her face now.
She buckled up habitually and then covered herself with her hands. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">If Amber was
insulted by Lillian&rsquo;s silence she didn&rsquo;t indicate as much. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t like
that at the school.&rdquo; She said matter of factly. Mr Reynolds started the van and
backed out onto the road.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t like what?&rdquo;
Lillian managed after thirty seconds of continued silence.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Crying. Or
covering yourself.&rdquo; She answered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Are all girls
like, always, you know?&rdquo; Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Naked? No, just
when they arrive, and sometimes for punishments and lessons. But when you are
naked you get punished for covering yourself.&rdquo; Amber explained. Her voice was
crisp and sweet.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right.
Lillian, move your hands.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said from the front seat.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian obeyed,
but fresh tears appeared. She was so exposed, it wasn&rsquo;t fair. The upholstery
was itchy on her bare backside. She wiped the tears away, remembering that
Amber said they were forbidden as well.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty
name.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Why are you
here?&rdquo; Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re buddies.&rdquo;
She answered. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Buddies?&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Like partners.
When I was sold two weeks ago there was no one to be my buddy. So when Mr
Reynolds was sent to buy you they sent me along to drive with you to the
school.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Where is the
school?&rdquo; Lillian asked. It was getting easier to talk now.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Far. Like two
hours away. We left really early in the morning.&rdquo; She answered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">They fell into a
long silence after that. They were on the freeway now. Every person in every
passing car could surely see her as they passed. Rain began to fall again as
they drove. Lillian shivered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s cold.
I was super cold when I came to the school.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;What does a buddy
do?&rdquo; Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re partners.
We go to class together and we help each other, we practice some things with
each other. Oh and we share a bed.&rdquo; She said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Share a <i style="">bed</i>?&rdquo; Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Mhm. The other
girls are jealous and give me a hard time since I get my own bed because I
don&rsquo;t have a buddy yet.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">There was another
long silence. They were leaving the big city behind and were now traveling into
the countryside.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Hey Lillian, I
have an idea.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Would you be more
comfortable if I got naked too?&rdquo; She asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The offer touched
her. Maybe having a buddy wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; She asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
buddies are for.&rdquo; Amber said, kicking off her simple sandals and undoing her
seatbelt. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Thank you Amber.&rdquo;
Lillian said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber pulled her
dress over her head, revealing her skinny torso and simple cotton panties.
Lillian could see her ribs. Amber didn&rsquo;t have noticeable breasts yet, only
rounded lumps. With some effort Amber shimmied her underwear off as well,
leaving her totally nude like her buddy.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">They looked at
each other, both blushing a bit, Lillian more so than Amber. Lillian had never
seen another girl her age naked before, only babies and toddlers and even then
only rarely. She was curious in spite of herself. Amber&rsquo;s body was girlish and
less developed than hers, but beautiful in it&rsquo;s own awkward and gangly way.
Amber was thin as a stick with long, skinny limbs. Her privates were small,
tight, and hairless, which contrasted with Lillian&rsquo;s which were thick and had a
small tuft of hair. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
you two bonding already.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said from the front. Lillian had almost
forgotten him. His interjection almost ruined the moment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re
pretty.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;You too.&rdquo; Lillian
said with a smile.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d grow
boobs.&rdquo; Amber said mournfully, looking down at her chest. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;You will.&rdquo;
Lillian said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yeah but the
other girls tease me.&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;How many are
there?&rdquo; Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Thirty six girls
between the ages of twelve and sixteen. Thirty five not counting yourself.&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds answered uninvited.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian and Amber
both indulged in a dirty look at the front seat. Amber was right, stripping
down did make her feel better. Being naked isn&rsquo;t as bad when you&rsquo;re not the
only one.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;What about boys?&rdquo;
Lillian asked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;No boys. Only
girls. There is a school for boys next to ours and they tell me that sometimes
we do stuff together, but the Temple of Venus is girls only.&rdquo; Amber answered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Enough talk.&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds said. &ldquo;Amber, show her how to kiss to pass the time.&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Kiss?&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Yeah, all the
girls practice kissing with their buddies.&rdquo; Amber explained as she unbuckled
and scooted over.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I, I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;
Lillian said apprehensively.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a
request.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said sternly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian looked at
Amber, who was now right beside her in the middle seat. Amber nodded. Lillian
nodded back. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber leaned in
and planted a gentle kiss on her lips. At that moment a fire lit in Lillian&rsquo;s
stomach. She&rsquo;d been thinking about girls lately, as well as boys. She had seen
boys and girls kissing before, and often imagined doing it herself with
someone. When doing the rubbies at night sometimes her thoughts accidentally
went to girls she knew at school. When Amber&rsquo;s lips touched hers she knew in
that moment that she wanted to kiss her back, so she did.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">They pulled apart,
grinning girlishly at each other. &ldquo;That was only the beginning of how we&rsquo;re
supposed to do it.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Keep going.&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds ordered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;The other girls
taught me, but we&rsquo;re supposed to do it with our buddy.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Then show me.&rdquo;
Lillian said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber answered by
scootching in all the way so their hips and shoulders were touching. The bare
skin on skin physical contact was warm and pleasant. She tilted her head in and
licked Lillian&rsquo;s face, from her right jawline, up the check, and stopping just
below the eye. Lillian&rsquo;s eyes went wide.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber giggled.
&ldquo;Now you.&rdquo;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian&rsquo;s heart
was pounding. Here she was, in a van that was carrying her to a lifetime of
slavery, naked as the day she was born, and now she was expected to kiss a girl
she barely knew. It was too much.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Please, Lillian.
We&rsquo;ll get in trouble.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian remembered
the fire she had felt the first time and the desire to kiss her new friend.
That combined with a desire to not get her or anyone into trouble, inspired her
to lick Amber back. She passed her tongue over her face in the same way she
had. The feel of her skin beneath her tongue, the taste of her, was
enthralling.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber planted a
long kiss on Lillian&rsquo;s lips, and this time their mouths opened. Lillian&rsquo;s heart
beat even faster when Amber&rsquo;s tongue entered her mouth. She moved her tongue
over her friend&rsquo;s as they kissed. They pulled apart after three or four
seconds. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;That felt really
good.&rdquo; Amber said. Lillian answered by smiling.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian initiated
the next kiss, this time licking her friend twice, once on the forehead and
again from the jaw up to the ear. Amber shivered as Lillian&rsquo;s tongue passed
over and partially into her ear. Amber answered by again kissing her on the
lips and exploring the inside of Lillian&rsquo;s mouth with her tongue. This time the
kiss lasted almost a dozen seconds before they pulled apart.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;This is so much
more fun than when I had to do it with the other girls.&rdquo; Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Suddenly very bold
Lillian began marinading her friend&rsquo;s face with saliva, using her lips and
tongue however she chose, while Amber did the same to her. It was fun,
ecstatic, and for a time Lillian forgot about the terribleness of her
situation. When at last they decided to finish they were both sweaty, blushing,
and their faces were wet. Damp spots had formed on the upholstery in between
their legs.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen
two buddies take to each other as well as you two have.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds commented.
</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber reached over
and cupped Lillian&rsquo;s left breast in her hand. Lillian recoiled and pushed it
away. Suddenly the gravity of her situation returned in full force. The
temporary reprieve provided by making out with Amber was gone.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian turned
away and leaned against the door, her shoulder pressed against the cold glass.
Tears ran down her face like the raindrops on the glass. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Amber didn&rsquo;t say
anything but scooted back to the passenger side seat and buckled in again. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Finally Mr
Reynolds turned the van off the freeway and onto a single lane road that cut
through empty land.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Almost there.&rdquo;
Amber said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo; Mr
Reynolds said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The road created a
small incline and then the Temple of Venus came into view.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your new
home Lillian.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The school was a
complex of minor buildings that surrounded a large central structure that
looked like an Ancient Greek or Roman temple. They weren&rsquo;t kidding with their
name.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">The van parked
near a wrought iron gate in the high stone wall that enclosed the complex, in a
covered row of parking places that were filled by identical vans and personal
vehicles. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian&rsquo;s sense of
exposure increased again as she and Amber exited the van. Her nakedness was
exacerbated further when Amber was made to put her clothes back on by Mr
Reynolds, who said that only Lillian should be nude for her orientation. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian had to
battle the urge to cover herself with her hands as they passed through the gate
one after the other. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Immediately ahead
of them was a one story brick building set on a small incline. A stairway led
from the stone walkway up to the main doors. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">They ascended
these stairs. Lillian keenly kept her eyes open for students and staff but saw
none. As they approached the doors a stern looking woman close to Mr Reynolds
in age and similar in their professional yet somewhat uncanny demeanors emerged
and stood at the top of the stairs.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Good morning Mrs
Andrews, I&rsquo;ve brought to you Lillian, age thirteen by one day. Lillian, this is
Mrs Andrews, she will process you from here.&rdquo; Mr Reynolds said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian held out
her hand to shake and was met with a cool glare in response. Mrs Andrews looked
at her outstretched hand as if it were a dead squirrel on the walkway. She
pulled it away. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Mr Reynolds, her
papers.&rdquo; She said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">He handed her a
binder from his briefcase. She flipped through the contents quickly. Lillian
shivered in the air. At least it had stopped raining. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Hmph. It would
appear from his assessments that Mr Reynolds thinks rather highly of you.&rdquo; She
said. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">She gave Lillian a
long look, surveying her nude body with eyes that felt like X-ray beams. Her
skin crawled under her gaze.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&ldquo;Well we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
Mrs Andrews said. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve met your buddy already. Follow me. We&rsquo;re going
to make a proper slave out of you.&rdquo; </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN">Lillian and Amber
followed her into the building. The doors shut behind them, ending Lillian&rsquo;s
old life forever. </span>
