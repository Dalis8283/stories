                    title: "Chapter 1",
                    subtitle: "PROLOGUE - Saturday in the Park",
                    content: `"I’ve found this brilliant place for us to go on holiday this summer!" Conchita said with her customary enthusiasm, and I felt that familiar mixture of fear, trepidation, excitement and anticipation. She was always coming up with ‘bright ideas’ and, somewhere along the line, they usually involved me getting into trouble. I gave a sigh and raised an eyebrow, wondering what she had come up with this time.<br><br>Conchita had been my best friend throughout school, since we had both arrived on the same day at the rather exclusive girls’ boarding school as thirteen-year-olds. I was sick with nerves and on the verge of crying my eyes out. My father was an officer in the British Army which paid for me to go to boarding school in England while he and my mother were posted around the world. This was great, except that I didn't come from money like all the other girls there, my upbringing had been relatively impoverished by comparison, and I felt out of place, and out of my league. I was sure that I was destined to become the butt of their jokes, and the target of their bullying.<br><br>Conchita, by contrast, was the exact opposite. She was bright, bubbly, and completely at home in the privileged atmosphere of the school. She was from Mexico, and she told everybody that her father was a very rich industrialist, although the rumour quickly spread around the school that he was actually a drug lord, and she made very little effort to dissuade people of this. So, she was foreign, exotic, very pretty, and, with her murky background, potentially dangerous. Of course she was immediately the leader of the cool gang, and she loved it. I don't know why, maybe she felt sorry for me, but she took me under her wing, and into her protection, and we were firm friends from that day on.<br><br>Our plan on leaving school was to get in a bit of R&R, probably lazing on a beach somewhere, then spend a few months working, doing bar work or waitressing, that kind of thing, earning enough money to fund a few months of travelling around the world, before we went off to university. At least, that was the plan until Conchita came up with a better idea.<br><br>"Go on then," I said with an air of resignation, entirely faked to disguise my extremely piqued level of interest, "what's your latest brilliant idea?"<br><br>"Hey, less of your cheek, Missy," she retorted, wagging her finger at me, "that kind of insubordination can get a girl a good spanking!"<br><br>"Yes, Mistress!" We sometimes joked around that we were a dominant-submissive couple. At least, I think we were joking.<br><br>"You remember that time you told me about your little ponygirl fetish?" she went on, "well, I found a place we can indulge your dirty little fantasy!" I simultaneously blushed and groaned at the memory of that embarrassing night several months previously, the one where we had spent hours drinking and schlepping around the seedier parts of the Internet, encountering and exploring many strange websites showing all manner of perversions. I'd hoped she'd forgotten, but I should have known better - she never forgot anything, certainly not anything which could embarrass me as much as that!<br><br>"Chi!" I pleaded, " I told you, that was just a joke to wind you up!" I could feel my cheeks burning with shame.<br><br>"I know you better than that, Sarah," she smirked, "you were so hot, I thought you were going to orgasm right in front of me! I bet you've been secretly fanning the flames of that desire since, haven't you?"<br><br>"I never!" I protested, but I knew I was going even more red as she nailed it.<br><br>"You’re a rotten liar," she said triumphantly, "so stop trying to deny it and listen to what I have to say." Glumly, I put my most sullen look on my face and shut my mouth, knowing that I was already beaten.<br><br>"That's better, my slutty little friend," she said, reaching forward and stroking my blazing cheek like I was her pet or something, "I found this website for a place in Devon which does all sorts of things for girls like you who’re into this stuff – weekends, training courses, shows, events, get-togethers. It sounds right up your street!"<br><br>Reluctantly, I agreed to take a look. I didn't want to encourage Conchita, but when she was in this kind of mood - excited and enthusiastic - it was almost impossible to refuse her.<br><br>The organisation, called ‘Specialist Pony Training Stables’, sounded very professional, while phrases like "all-female staff, fully trained and experienced in handling ponygirls", "focused on your safety and enjoyment", "5-star accommodation and Michelin-starred food" provided reassurance. I found that the phrase "handling ponygirls", along with the accompanying photographs, was making me very interested.<br><br>"It sounds very expensive," I said doubtfully.<br><br>"Don't worry," Conchita said breezily, "my dad doesn't know it yet, but he'll be paying for it out of my allowance."<br><br>"I don't know," I said nervously, excited but also afraid of the unknown, "Will you do it with me?"<br><br>"I wouldn't miss it for the world!" she exclaimed with a broad grin, obviously feeling triumphant that I had caved. "Let's fill in the application details right now!"<br><br>And that's what we did, right there, right then - I think Conchita wanted to get me signed up before any doubts or second thoughts set in. She pulled up the application page on the website, and I was rather overwhelmed by the list of questions. It started with a worrying message:<br><br><i>WARNING: you must not apply to Specialist Pony Training Stables if you suffer from any of the following conditions - asthma, hayfever, difficulty with breathing, heart conditions, high blood pressure, or if you have undergone in-patient treatment in the past 12 months, are currently being treated for a medical condition, or are on any prescribed medication. Failure to declare any pre-existing medical condition to SPTS will invalidate your insurance and SPTS will not be liable for any incident related to such a condition.<br><br>NOTE: All participants must be over the age of 18 on the first day of their visit.<br><br>I have read the above notices and declare that I am over 18 and do not suffer from any pre-existing medical condition [ ]</i><br><br>"It's just boilerplate," Conchita said dismissively, "just tick it and let's get on with it." Rather less enthusiastic than I had been only moments before, I put an tick in the box and read on. The next set of questions were fairly straightforward and I quickly filled them in:<br><br><i>Date of Application: [03/04/2015]<br>Name: [Sarah Johnson]<br>Date of Birth: [09/06/1997]<br>Height: [5] feet [9] inches / [ ] metres<br>Bra Size: [32D]<br>Waist: [23] inches<br>Hips: [34] inches<br>Shoe Size: UK [6] EUR [ ] US [ ]<br>Hair Colour: [blonde]</i><br><br>I was, as always, embarrassed by entering my vital statistics because I knew that anyone reading them would immediately do the calculation "blonde + big boobs = bimbo". I had been quite a normal, nondescript little girl until puberty kicked in, and then my body seemed to go crazy, giving me the perfect physique for a dumb nymphomaniac. So many people had said to me ‘oh, you should go into modelling’ - by which they meant nude, glamour or pornography - as if that were the pinnacle of female ambition. The fact that I was predicted to get straight A’s in my A levels and planned to go to a good university to do a degree in Philosophy made no difference to the guys who regularly letched and leered at me, barely able to lift their eyes from my tits and ass to actually look me in the eye.<br><br>"When are we going to go?" I asked as I looked at the next question.<br><br>"Right after school’s finished," Conchita replied instantly, "strike while the iron’s hot!"<br><br>"How long for? I didn't see the options, or the prices," I said, chewing my lip doubtfully, "I don't think-"<br><br>"No, honey, I do the thinking, you just look pretty! We'll go for two weeks, from the 14th of July."<br><br>"Two weeks?!" I exclaimed in astonishment, "what if we don't like it? What if it's too weird? What if-"<br><br>"Shhhh!" Conchita chided, pressing a finger against my lips, "I'm paying, so I make the rules. Go on, fill it in!"<br><br><i>Preferred Date of Visit: [14/07/2015] to [28/07/2015]<br>Service Level: Full [ ]  Session [ ]<br>Tack: Full [ ]  Intermediate [ ]  Beginners/Trial [ ]<br>Dress: None [ ]  Swimwear [ ]  Full Bodysuit [ ]  Bodysuit+Hood [ ]</i><br><br>"I've got no idea what those questions even mean!" I wailed, not liking the sound of any of them.<br><br>"Don't worry, hun, I've checked it out, just cross the first box on each."<br><br>"But, ‘Service Level’, what does that mean?! ‘Tack’? Shouldn't we be going for ‘Beginners’? And ‘Dress’, does that mean we have to be naked?! I don't-"<br><br>"Will you just shut up and trust me!" Conchita barked rather angrily, this time covering my whole mouth with her hand, "this is your one chance to experience this - let's go for the Max!" Very reluctantly, and with severe misgivings, I did as she ordered.<br><br>"I don't know how to answer this one - ‘Preferred Pony Name’. What you think?"<br><br>"Well," Conchita said thoughtfully, "I think you should draw attention to your best assets."<br><br>"What, you think I should be called ‘Big Jugs’ or something?!" I asked wryly, only half-joking.<br><br>"No," she replied patiently, "they may be  your most obvious assets, but not your best. I really like your baby blue eyes. I think you should be called ‘Bright Eyed Beauty’."<br><br>"I think we should leave the ‘Beauty’ to the eye of the beholder, I'll just go with ‘Bright Eyes’," I said, writing it down. "There, all done. Satisfied?"<br><br>"Well done, my soon-to-be little pony, now run along and play with yourself while I do mine and fill in the payment details and such." With that, she shooed me out of the room and I went back to my own bedroom, wondering what I had just committed myself to.<br><br>I didn't actually get much time to think about it over the next term because it was just so busy. First there was my eighteenth birthday, which was rather spoiled by all of the exam revision I was doing. Then there were the exams themselves, which seemed to go on forever and take all of my energy. And then, at the end of term, there was the Leavers’ Ball. All the girls in the final year always vote for who should be Queen of the Ball and, to my total astonishment, I was chosen. I'm pretty sure Conchita had somehow organised it that way, because the tradition was that the week before the Ball, the girls would go out to the nightclubs in the nearby city, and there was always some hazing of the elected Queen, usually involving too much alcohol and some risque photographs.<br><br>It was generally agreed later, especially by the staff, that on this occasion, things had gone a little too far - no, actually, make that a lot too far! I don't know at which point I lost my dress, but I do vaguely remember a lot of sexy, semi-naked dancing, plus throwing up in the gutter, and then trying to snog a policeman as he and his colleague ‘helped’ us back to the minibus. Everything after that point is pretty much a blank until I woke up in bright sunlight to find that I had been stripped naked and handcuffed to the Founder’s statue in front of the school. As if that wasn't bad enough, the entire senior staff of the school, led by the Headmistress, were standing in front of me, staring in horror at their upcoming Queen. And as if that wasn't bad enough either, they had to get a locksmith - a male locksmith, at that - to come and cut me free. Talk about embarrassing!<br><br>Conchita seemed to become more and more controlling all week. She told me that she would be choosing my formal evening dress for the Ball, and she wouldn't let me see it before the big night, despite my desperate pleading. When it was finally revealed, it was everything I had feared and, to be honest, fully expected. It was red, body-hugging and backless, with spaghetti shoulder straps supporting a deep cleavage, preventing me from wearing any kind of bra, and it was so low-cut at the back that I was showing a little cleavage there too, forcing me to wear a thong so that there were no panty lines. To compliment this was a pair of strappy red high heels, and when I put them on, it took me all my effort not to fall off them again and sprain an ankle. They were taller than any I'd ever worn before, and I had to practice just standing up in them, never mind walking!<br><br>The Ball was fabulous and, I have to admit it, the dress was a spectacular success. Our school was twinned with a boys’ boarding school, and their final year pupils were always invited, bringing their own ‘King of the Ball’, who would escort and dance with the Queen. He was very attractive in his tuxedo, and had enough class and sophistication to not drool when we started the first dance. Normally, once the formalities have been completed, the girls and boys tend to gravitate back to their own groups, but it didn't happen that night, if only because they were taking their lead from their King and Queen who were, apparently, inseparable.<br><br>I'm not a great one for dancing myself, but Darren, my partner, was quite a good conversationalist, and every dance became a slow dance, regardless of the actual tempo of the music, as he pulled me in close, his hands creeping down until they were each firmly clasping a plump buttock through the sheer material.<br><br>"I have to admit," he said with a smile, "I'm not usually keen on dancing either, but then again I don't usually get to dance with such a beautiful girl as you. Do you fancy a breath of fresh air?"<br><br>We picked up a drink at the bar and went out into the gardens through the French windows. As we strolled down one of the paths, we held hands and smiled up at each other.<br><br>"Where do you think you’re going, Sarah? Darren?" I turned to see the PE mistress walking after us. We dropped each other's hand like we’d been electrocuted.<br><br>"Just taking the night air, Miss Pemberton," I replied innocently.<br><br>"I'm sure. Back inside, both of you!" Rather dejectedly, our unspoken plans spoiled, we walked back to the school hall, followed at a not-so-discrete distance by the suspicious teacher.<br><br>"Where have you been?" Conchita asked accusingly, grabbing my arm and leading me towards the toilets.<br><br>"We were just… anyway, Pembers stopped us before anything could happen. Just as I thought I might finally lose my virginity!"<br><br>"Get in there," she ordered, and I realised we were standing outside the loo. "Lock the door, take off your dress and that thong, and wait for my signal." Before I could protest, she had opened the door and shoved me inside. Unable to think for myself, and overcome with fears of being discovered, I blindly obeyed my orders and stripped. I waited for what felt like hours before there was a knock on the door.<br><br>"Open up, fair Queen," I heard Conchita say, "your prince is here, ready to fuck your brains out!" With trembling fingers, I unlocked the door, let him stumble in, and locked it again, pressing my back against it. My heart was pounding and I was struggling for breath.<br><br>"Holy crap!" Darren breathed as he stared at my naked body, my breasts rising and falling in rhythm with my rapid gasps for air. He started scrabbling to unfasten his trousers but, as he pulled them down and I saw the tent in his boxer shorts, he suddenly stopped.<br><br>"Oh shit!" he whispered, "I don't have a condom! I never thought…"<br><br>"Don't worry," I said with a smile as I pointed to the sticking plaster on my arm, "I have a contraceptive patch - ironically they insist on it here. Now, do like the woman said and fuck my brains out!"<br><br>And, to be fair, he did a pretty good job of it. Admittedly, I didn't have anything to compare it to then, but I reckon he was a good fuck. I wrapped my legs around him as he held me up and dropped me onto his very stiff erection. I buried my face in his neck to try and stifle my cries as he pumped me mercilessly, until I reached a glorious climax, just before he came.<br><br>As I sat on the toilet, trying to get my breath back and get his spunk out of me, he straightened his attire.<br><br>"That was amazing, Sarah, thank you so much," he whispered, leaning down to kiss me whilst he copped a last feel of my breasts. "I'd better get back before they send out a search party!" With that, he was out of the door and I locked it behind him. I couldn't believe that I had lost my virginity in the toilets at a boarding school. What a cliché!<br><br>A week later, Conchita and I were on the train to Devon. It was the first time I had really had the opportunity to think about what we were doing, and why I was attracted in the first place to the idea of being a ponygirl. When I had first seen the pictures on the Internet, I had immediately thought how sexy the women looked in their regalia, and I began to wonder what it would be like to be dressed like that, and to be treated like that - part animal, part slave, all sex object. I started to do some research into the whole subject and found out that this kind of pet play was part of BDSM, something I had never come across and of which I had no experience at all. I learned that it was, at heart, about power exchange, about trusting someone enough to give up control to them.<br><br>I realised that I was going to be giving up control to complete strangers although, as I understood it, they were trained, professional strangers. It started to dawn on me that I didn't really know what I was getting into, and that I had no verifiable proof about this organisation. I was certainly very grateful that I wasn't here alone, and Conchita was clearly very surprised when I gave her a spontaneous hug.<br><br>"I hope we're not doing something incredibly stupid," I said nervously as the train pulled in to the station.<br><br>"Stop worrying, will you?" Conchita said with exasperation in her voice, "I've got everything under control. You're going to love this!"<br><br>We got off the train at Exeter and looked around for the woman who was due to meet us.<br><br>"Hello, Ms Johnson? Ms Alvarez? I'm Diana, and will be taking you to the hotel today." The woman, in her early thirties, certainly looked the part, wearing tan jodhpurs, black riding boots, a white blouse and a navy jacket. We followed her to the car park, where she indicated for us to climb into the back seat of a BMW.<br><br>"We like to keep the location of our facility secret," she said as she turned around in the driver’s seat, "we don't want to be troubled by nosy reporters. So I'm going to have to hold onto your mobile phones and ask you to wear these." She handed a pair of sunglasses to each of us. I took out my phone but looked at her questioningly.<br><br>"Most mobiles have GPS," she explained with a smile, "can't be too careful." Conchita shrugged and handed over her phone, and I followed suit. When I put the wraparound glasses on, I realised that they had been blacked out so that we would not see any of the journey. Well, I thought, they are either extremely cautious or human traffickers leading us into a life of slavery. Trying to relax, I sank back in the seat as we moved off.<br><br>The journey took about half an hour, and passed in silence. When we finally stopped, we were allowed to take our glasses off and we found ourselves outside a very impressive hotel. Diana led us into the lobby whilst another woman in riding gear took our bags inside.<br><br>"Wow, this place looks amazing!" Conchita enthused as we looked around the plush surroundings. We approached the reception desk, where another woman, this one dressed rather more like a hotel employee, had us sign the register.<br><br>"If you'd like to come with me," Diana said, "I can show you around the stables and we'll fit you for your pony tack." As she led us back out of the hotel and down a path towards a large building, I could feel my excitement growing, knowing that my strange fantasy was about to come true. I beamed a nervous smile at my friend, who returned it with enthusiasm. We went inside, into what felt like a kind of anteroom with several doors leading off it. After a few moments, the girl who had taken our bags entered the room.<br><br>"Sarah, this is Chloe," Diana said, introducing the young girl, who smiled and shook my hand, "she will be your personal groom throughout your time with us, and will deal with all your needs, as well as leading you through our ponygirl training programme. If you would like to go with her, I will sort out Conchita."<br><br>Chloe beckoned for me to follow her through one of the doors and, with a nervous but excited look over my shoulder at Conchita, I went into the next room. Chloe closed the door and led me over to a desk, where we sat on either side, her looking at a computer screen. I looked around, noticing that it was a lot like a locker room at the gym.<br><br>"Okay, Sarah, I just need to check that we still have the right details from your application," the young woman said, "then we can do an inventory of your things, so nothing goes missing whilst you're here."<br><br>She read through all the questions I had answered before, having me confirm my answers. I found this a little weird, given that some of my answers had been cajoled out of me by Conchita, and I had to actively resist the temptation to change my responses to something I felt safer with. As we went through them, my feelings of nervousness, excitement and anticipation grew again as I tried to imagine what was about to happen.<br><br>Chloe then had me turn out my pockets so that she could note down everything I had brought - keys, credit card, cash, lipstick, and so on – and  I also took off my watch, bangles and my gold necklace. She put everything into a clear plastic bag, which she then sealed and placed into a metal box which had a label stuck to it, reading ‘SARAH JOHNSON (Bright Eyes)’. I suddenly had the feeling that I was being admitted to prison!<br><br>"Very good," she smiled, "now I just need you to take your clothes off and put them in the box as well." I suppose I should have seen that coming, but it was still a surprise. After a moment's hesitation, I stood up and pulled my T-shirt off over my head, kicked off my shoes and pulled down my leggings.<br><br>Feeling my face flush with embarrassment, I picked up my clothes and folded them neatly before putting them into the metal box. I shot a glance at the woman on the other side of the table, probably only a few years older than me, and then unfastened my bra and added it to the pile, finally taking off my panties to leave myself naked. I watched as Chloe closed the box and locked it, taking it over to one of the lockers and returning with another box. This one had a label on it saying ‘BRIGHT EYES (Sarah Johnson)’, signifying, in my mind, that I was now making the transition from girl to ponygirl.<br><br>"We'll start with the boots," she said as she opened the box and took out the strangest pair of boots I had ever seen. "Just sit down and pull them on - they're surprisingly comfortable."<br><br>"How would you know?" I asked sceptically, examining the huge hoof-like soles, the lack of heel, and the shiny black leather uppers which would reach to my knees. I noticed that they even had what looked like authentic metal horseshoes on the bottom!<br><br>"Because I’ve worn them," she replied without rancour, "we spend a week training as ponygirls as part of our induction so that we fully understand what you are experiencing." I was surprised but greatly reassured by this, and pulled the boots on.<br><br>It was like wearing very high heels with platform soles - my toes went into the hoof part and my heel was left suspended in the air, but supported by the firm structure of the boot. Chloe laced them really tightly, and I gingerly stood up, fighting to keep my balance. After a few seconds, I risked taking a faltering step, then another, holding my arms out at my side to maintain my equilibrium.<br><br>I was actually rather astonished to find that the boots were not only comfortable but also relatively easy to walk in. The hoof sole splayed out so much on either side of my foot that there was little danger of falling off them and twisting an ankle and, even if I had, the boots were tight enough to leave virtually no sideways movement – it was like wearing a pair of ski boots. I spent several minutes walking up and down, getting my confidence. They were heavier than any footwear I had worn before, and I had to pick up my feet as I stepped forward, making me feel like I was walking in diving boots. When I put my hooved foot down, it clattered on the tiled floor in a very authentic imitation of a horse’s hoof, which I found strangely exciting.<br><br>"Well done, Sarah, it looks like you’ve got the hang of that pretty quickly. Let's sort out your other hooves now!" She took what looked like more boots from the box, but I could see that the hoof did not fit with the rest of the leather in the same way, and overall they were much shorter. These were obviously for my hands.<br><br>I held out my left arm and Chloe pushed the hoof over my hand. I had expected my fingers to be cramped inside this very strange glove, but I was perfectly free to stretch them out and move them around inside the stiff casing, although I knew they rendered my hands useless. The leather came up over my wrist about halfway up my forearm, and was fastened in place when she buckled a leather strap around my arm. She repeated this on my right hand, and I found myself looking down at two large brown hooves at the end of my arms and, beyond that, two more at the end of my legs. The glove-hooves were also surprisingly heavy as they were also shod with authentic iron horseshoes, and I found it difficult to hold my arms up for any length of time, it being much less tiring to leave them dangling at my sides.<br><br>"Your harness is next," Chloe said as she held up a mass of leather and brass before me. Once she had untangled it, she placed it over my head, leaving two straps across my shoulders, with the rest of the harness hanging down in front and back. The shoulder straps attached to two large brass rings which she fitted over my breasts, having to ease and manipulate them through the rings because, as I mentioned before, I have large breasts. She pulled the leather straps joined to the sides of the rings behind my back and buckled them together, attaching the shoulder straps so that it felt like I was wearing a leather and brass brassiere. The sensation was reinforced when I realised that small flaps of leather were attached to the bottom of the rings and were supporting my breasts, thrusting them forwards, on display.<br><br>Leather straps led down from the breast rings to a smaller brass ring which lay over my navel. This also had straps at the side which buckled together behind my back. A fifth strap hung down from the ring and ended in a metal buckle, obviously ready to accept a strap which I guessed would be added between my legs.<br><br>"Okay, Sarah," Chloe said calmly, "place your hooves on the table and bend over for me." I did as I was ordered, wondering what was coming next. My groom took what looked like a long, thin blonde wig from the box and held it up before me. After a few moments staring at it, it dawned on me that this was to be my ponytail and, when she turned it slightly, I understood just how literal that was. The hair was attached at one end to a phallic shape which, alarmingly, ended in a sphere about the size of a golf ball.<br><br>"Oh my God!" I breathed in horror, "you're not going to… put that inside me, are you?!"<br><br>"Don't worry," Chloe replied as she smothered the monster in lubricant, "it looks far worse than it feels. You'll get used to it soon enough." I felt her hand on the small of my back, then the cold touch of the slippery silicone between my buttocks, pressing against my anus. I closed my eyes and bit my lip, preparing for the worst.<br><br>If she had been right about the boots being more comfortable than they looked, I would definitely dispute her claims about the butt plug. I let out an anguished gasp as the ball forced my little brown flower to open and stretch way beyond anything I had ever experienced before. I was sure my skin was going to tear, and I couldn't suppress a howl of pain as she pressed it harder against me, forcing me wider, wider, and then - plop! It was inside me, and my sphincter closed gratefully around the much smaller diameter of the following shaft. The flanges of the plug pressed against the skin between my cheeks, leaving me feeling as though I was suffering the worst case of constipation ever.<br><br>"Good girl," Chloe said condescendingly, "now straighten up for me." As I did so – slowly, carefully, uncomfortably - she pulled a thin leather strap between my thighs and up over my bare pussy before attaching it loosely to the buckle below my waist. I felt her fingers on my pussy lips, parting them around the strap so that it lay along the soft flesh of my cleft, and I realised that the inside surface was uneven, it's strange bumps gently pressing against me although, curiously, I couldn't feel it squeezing my clitoris. After a few seconds and a bit of squirming, and I decided that there was another small brass ring in the strap, and my clitoris was poking through it!<br><br>The strap was gently pressing against me, that is, until she took hold of the end of it and yanked it as tight as she could before fastening the buckle. I let out another gasp as the strap simultaneously forced the butt plug deeper into my rectum and drove the ridged strap and the brass ring hard against my most sensitive flesh.<br><br>As I tried to come to terms with this intimate violation, Chloe attached leather straps around my upper arms, then bent my arm until my hoof-covered hand was by my shoulder. A small clip on the retaining strap of the glove attached to a D-ring on the strap around my bicep and, immediately, I had lost the use of my arms, pinned uselessly in place.<br><br>"Okay, time for the interesting part," the girl smiled, "the bridle." She picked up another tangle of leather and brass, smaller than the body harness, and brought it to the top of my head. She gathered my hair together into a ponytail and passed it through a ring in the top of this new harness. A wide leather strap went across my forehead, buckling tight behind and attaching the strap holding the ring around my hair so that it lay snugly over my scalp. More straps now came down either side of my face, and I found my field of vision restricted by leather panels at my temples - I was blinkered.<br><br>The straps ended in brass rings which lay against my cheeks, and were held firmly in place by straps which buckled at the nape of my neck and underneath my chin. Chloe reached into the box once more and turned back to me holding a metal rod with various attachments on it which I didn't understand at all.<br><br>"Open," she ordered, holding the device in front of my mouth. When I did so, she pushed it between my lips, deep into my mouth until I started to gag and choke as part of it touched the back of my tongue. The rod went right across my mouth, forcing my jaws open and my lips to stretch, while the attachments I had seen earlier hooked behind my teeth to hold it in place. Some kind of plate pressed down on my tongue, preventing me from lifting it or moving it around. I tried to force the bit out of my mouth, but Chloe held it in place until she had clipped each end on to the rings of the bridle, at which point it was firmly in place until she might decide to remove it.<br><br>"The most important rule of being a ponygirl is that ‘Ponies Don't Talk’," she said as she rummaged in the box once again, "that bit well obviously help you to remember that, but this will ensure that you’re not tempted." She was holding up a wide leather collar and, on the inside at the front, I noticed two vertical metal strips.<br><br>"These lie either side of your throat," she explained, "they detect the movement of the muscles in your esophagus and check for the movements involved in forming words. If a recognised pattern occurs, the collar will deliver a mild electric shock to… remind you." She fitted the collar around my neck and fastened it tightly in place, forcing my chin upwards. I could feel the metal strips against my skin, and also something sharp pressing into my neck on either side. I was alarmed, starting to panic that I had just been locked into a machine which would automatically - without feeling? without mercy? - punish me if I tried to speak. I managed to rein myself in, as it were, after a few moments - all I had to do was keep my mouth shut, which shouldn't be too difficult, it's not like I'm a big talker anyway.<br><br>"Okay, you're done," Chloe smiled, turning me around and leading me across the room to stand in front of a full-length mirror on the wall. "Welcome to the world, Bright Eyes!"<br><br>I was stunned. I looked like all those pictures I had drooled over on the Internet, and all I could think about was how sexy I was! The most impressive thing was the tail which, rather than hanging down limply between my legs, sprang upwards from between my buttocks and cascaded down and out, more like a rooster's tail than a pony’s. I couldn't wait to show Conchita, and to see how incredible she looked - her dark eyes, silky black hair and coffee-coloured skin would just look great against the leather and brass of the harness.<br><br>"Walk on!" Chloe commanded as she took hold of one of the rings on my bridle. I followed her to the door and back out into the anteroom we had been in earlier.<br><br>"Oh my God, Sarah, you look amazing!" I found that, because of the restriction of the collar around my neck, I had to turn my whole body towards the sound of the voice to see my friend. But I was astonished and confused to see that she wasn't dressed in her ponygirl outfit, but was still wearing the same clothes as earlier.<br><br>"Huh?" I grunted, a look of bafflement on my face as she walked up to me, smiling broadly as she stroked my cheek.<br><br>"What?" she laughed, "you didn't really expect me to let them do this to me as well, did you?! This is your fantasy, honey, not mine!"<br><br>"Chi! What the f-Aaaaaaayiiiieeeoowwwww!!" My protestations were cut short as I felt pain shooting through me from the collar, making my jaw clamp down convulsively on the metal bit. It didn't last long, but it felt like my head was about to explode, and I screwed up my face, staggering a little under the assault.<br><br>"Oops, sorry, I didn't mean to get you into trouble," Conchita said, clearly not remorseful at all, "I'll leave you to enjoy your training. I hear the siren call of a margarita waiting by the pool. Adios, sweetie, see you later!"<br><br>"Walk on!" A sharp tug on the bridle turned my head away so that my so-called ‘friend’ disappeared from my field of vision behind the blinkers and, as the bit dug sharply into the corner of my mouth, I stumbled after Chloe, unable to do anything but follow wherever she was leading me.<br><br>She opened the door and we stepped out into the bright afternoon sunshine. It appeared that I would be facing my ponygirl training alone…`

                    subtitle: "The Journey Continues",
                    content: `As we walked out into the afternoon sun, Chloe leading holding my bridle, me clip-clopping along behind her, I tried to come to terms with what had just happened. The reason I was here, in these stables dressed as a ponygirl, was because of my friend Conchita, who had talked me into this crazy adventure, having discovered my interest in the fetish and persuaded me that we should explore it together. Except that we weren’t together - she had tricked me and now I was about to experience God knows what, on my own.<br><br>Although, as it turned out, I wasn't going to be all on my own.<br><br>"Time to meet your stablemates," Chloe said as we walked out into a grassy field. I could hear movement around us but, because of the blinkers, I could only see what was directly in front of me as we moved forward. She brought me to a stop, holding my bridle firmly, not allowing me to turn my head to look around. I saw another young woman in riding gear walking into view a few yards away. She was holding a rope, leading…<br><br>"Bright Eyes, this is Scarlett Sunset," my trainer said and there, standing before me, was another woman dressed exactly like me! She was about my age, maybe a year or two older, with red hair and pale skin. She turned and, when she saw me, her green eyes crinkled and her mouth, already stretched by the bit between their teeth, widened in a smile of greeting. I smiled back as best I could, amused when she waggled her hips and her long ginger tail swished from side to side. We looked at each other in wonderment at what we were doing, and what we were allowing them to do to us. Her groom pulled on the rope and led Scarlett away, out of my sight.<br><br>"This is Scheherazade," Chloe said in introduction as another groom led her charge in front of me. If it hadn't been for the bridle and its strap under my chin, I think my jaw would have dropped open in astonishment at the incredible sight now before me. This ponygirl was magnificent - she was in her mid-twenties, tall, black, and with an athletic body, muscular arms and thighs, firm buttocks and a flat six-pack of a stomach. Her harness and bridle were made of white leather, which contrasted wonderfully against her ebony skin. Her breasts bulged through the brass rings, and her large, prominent nipples were pierced with beautiful gold hoops. She seemed to me to be the most beautiful woman - the most beautiful creature! - I had ever seen.<br><br>She tossed back her head and made a noise - "Neeeyyaaayy!" - which sounded remarkably like the whinny of a real horse, while she pawed the ground with her hoof. Her trainer gave the command "Walk on", and she obeyed instantly, moving along with a sinuous elegance, making me want to be as graceful as her.<br><br>"And this is Belle," Chloe said as the third woman was presented, and I could instantly see that she was different. She was older, probably in her mid-thirties, although still fit and attractive, but the startling difference was that she was not naked - underneath the leather harness, she was wearing a white bikini. Somehow, it looked incongruous, out of place, wrong, even though I remembered that this was one of the dress options. It seemed a bit cowardly, given that the rest of us were in the buff. But each to their own, I suppose.<br><br>I began to notice other differences as well. Her bridle didn't include blinkers, and the bit between their teeth was made of black rubber rather than metal. I also noticed that she wasn't wearing the stiff, high shock-collar, so presumably was not prevented from speaking. She gave me a relaxed smile before being moved on by her handler.<br><br>Chloe now clipped a rope to one of the rings of my bridle and led me forward, so that we were following the others in line. I looked at Belle in front of me, at her bikini-covered bum, and noticed that her tail was attached to the harness rather than to her. I could see that the harness strap was giving her a major wedgie, but I was sure that it was far less uncomfortable than the plug currently lodged in my butt!<br><br>I was brought to a halt and I watched as the other ponygirls also stopped and their handlers walked away from them until the rope between them, about ten feet long, was taught. They then reached down and picked up what I realised was a long whip, manoeuvring it so that the end lay against their charge’s back. I knew that Chloe was doing the same when I felt the touch of the whip against my shoulder blades, with the rest of it trailing down my back, tickling my buttocks.<br><br>"Walk on, Bright Eyes." As the whip prompted me with a light tap, I began to walk around in the circle described by the rope, watching as the others did the same. Around and around I walked, a little tentatively at first but quickly gaining confidence in my ability to manage the hoof-boots, but receiving the occasional slap of the whip against my behind if my pace slackened. It wasn't painful, but it definitely got my attention and made me concentrate harder.<br><br>"Step!" The new command confused me initially, but was soon clarified. "Get those knees up! Come on, higher! That's it! Good girl! Step! Step!" Under the prompting of the whip, I raised my knee on each step until my thigh was parallel with the ground and, in this vaguely goose-stepping way, I completed another ten circuits at the end of the training lariat.<br><br>"Prance!" I had no idea what this meant, but didn't have a good feeling about it, one which only got worse as things became clear. "Step and… Jump! Step and… Jump! Come on, pony, Jump!" The whip flicked painfully against the back of my standing leg as I was forced to leap from one foot - hoof - to the other until I was gasping for breath, perspiration breaking out across my brow. My breasts bounced alarmingly as I pranced, but the little leather platforms beneath them prevented them hurting too much.<br><br>Eventually I was allowed to stop, and I stood there, panting, feeling the ache in my thighs and tightness in my stomach muscles. Chloe walked over to me carrying a water bottle with a plastic straw, which she poked between my lips past the bit and squeezed. My mouth flooded with sweet, refreshing, cold water, which I guzzled down gratefully, not caring when it overflowed and ran down my chin to drip onto my overheated body. I appreciated it even more when she pulled the bottle away and squirted the water into my face and then over my breasts.<br><br>"Well done, Bright Eyes," she smiled, "let's go again." She disappeared from view and, moments later, I felt the whip against my back and obediently began to walk in circles once more.<br><br>We all went through the full routine again, circling around, moving from walk to step to prance, before we were introduced to another command.<br><br>"Trot!" Under the prompting of the whip, I moved from a walk to jogging around, completing lap after lap until I began to feel like a long-distance runner. I wondered how much sponsorship money I could raise for charity if I took part in the London Marathon dressed like this!<br><br>"Giddyup!" For the first time, the whip smacked really hard against my buttocks and, in startled response, I began to run around the circle. Suddenly, my hoof-boots came together and I tripped, losing my balance. I tried to put out my arms in front of me to stop my fall but, of course, I could do nothing, and I crashed to the ground in a heap. Luckily, the grass was lush and soft, cushioning my fall so that I was merely badly winded, and I lay there gasping for breath.<br><br>Chloe came over and helped me back to my feet/hooves, dusted me off and, once I had stopped wheezing, went back to the other end of the rope. Moments later, I felt the whip swipe my buttocks, and I started once again at walking pace.<br><br>I soon found out that there was a fourth speed that I had to achieve. After the initial walk, there was the ‘Trot’ at jogging pace, followed by the ‘Canter’, which was the fast jog at which I had fallen previously. But, after a couple of circuits of that, Chloe shouted "Gallop!" and whipped me hard. Now I was flying around the circle, going faster than I felt was safe, but unable to slow down without receiving another painful swat from the training whip.<br><br>At last, I was given the command to canter, then trot, walk and, finally, blissfully, to stop. I was panting, literally, like a racehorse, with sweat covering my body and dripping from my hairline into my eyes. My bottom lip and chin were also covered in saliva, which was even dripping down onto my breasts!<br><br>As I stood there, trying to recover, I turned and saw the other ponies - I mean girls – Scheherazade, Scarlett and Belle. They were just as exhausted and sweaty as me but, in truth, Scheherazade’s glistening black body looked even more magnificent in that state, with her muscular thighs and buttocks, her super-flat stomach, and her puffy labia split by the white leather strap. I realised I was staring, and I dragged my eyes away in embarrassment, surprised and confused by the strength of my reaction.<br><br>I felt the tug of the rope on my bridle and turned to follow my trainer as we formed a line and headed back towards the building where I had been transformed from a fairly independent girl into this strange creature who could be led around on the end of a rope and forced to do things which were certainly not natural for me - I'm quite fit, but I don't go to the gym or anything. Now, here I was taking part in this bizarre fitness programme!<br><br>I was following Scheherazade, and I found myself staring, as if mesmerised, at the perfect hemispheres of her buttocks swaying from side to side, swinging the black-haired tail jutting out from between them back and forth. Once again, I had to drag my eyes away as strange feelings began to stir within me.<br><br>We were just approaching the building where we had started when we were diverted, and our trainers led us into a fenced paddock. Chloe untied the training rope from my bridle, took the bit out of my mouth, and unclipped my wrists from the straps by my shoulders. As I exercised my jaw in relief, closing my lips for the first time in hours and running my tongue across my teeth to see if any damage had been done (I was relieved to find they were fine), Chloe and the other grooms left the paddock and closed the gate, shutting us inside.<br><br>To my surprise, I saw that Belle had not been left in the field but was being led back into the building. I looked around and saw that Scheherazade and Scarlett were still with me, which was reassuring, but I wondered what was happening with our fellow ponygirl. I went over to the gate and examined the fastening, which was quite simple and could have been opened in a moment, if I'd had a hand instead of a hoof at the end of my arm! As it was, we were trapped there until someone let us out, just as securely as if they had used padlocks and chains.<br><br>"Neeeyyaaayy!" I heard a whinny, and turned to see Scheherazade standing beside me. She smiled warmly and blew me a kiss, which I found funny, and I smiled back in what I hoped would be seen as a friendly response. I was surprised when she moved closer and, moments later, her body was pressed against mine. I felt the fence behind me and, when the black ponygirl hooked her hand-hooves over the rail on either side of me, I was cornered!<br><br>As our sweaty breasts squished together and she lifted her leg to rub her thigh against my hip, I looked up at her in alarm, only to see her lips stretched in a wide smile, with an amused, lustful look in her eyes. I had no idea what was going on or what I should do, and I basically just froze and stood there as she leaned forward, managed to turn her head against the restraint of the collar, and pressed her lips against mine.<br><br>I felt her grinding her hips into me as her tongue pushed its way into my unresisting mouth. Despite my girls-only public school upbringing, I had never experienced a lesbian kiss before - was it still a lesbian kiss if we were both ponygirls, I wondered. Her body sliding against mine felt good, she tasted salty and sweet at the same time and, without having taken any conscious decision to reciprocate, I was soon kissing her back with enthusiasm, our tongues wrestling as our mouths opened wider and we began to exchange saliva as well as sweat.<br><br>She managed to spread my legs by jamming a knee between my thighs, and pretty soon she had grabbed my leg between hers and was humping it like a dog in heat! I could feel the strap of her harness rubbing on my skin as she moved up and down against me and, as she pressed harder, I could feel the edge of the ring in the strap, the one which, if it was like mine, encircled her clitoris. She was getting herself off by ‘fucking’ my leg!<br><br>She began to make small, squeaking noises through her nose and then, as she became more aroused and rubbed herself against me harder and faster, she began to moan, at first into my mouth as we were still locked together in a desperate, passionate kiss and then, when she broke away, into my ear.<br><br>Without really thinking about it, I put my foot-hoof onto the bottom rail of the fence behind me, thrusting my knee forward and bringing my thigh up, giving her a much better angle to rub her pussy, and her clitoris, against me. I saw her smile at me in thanks as she put her head back, panting for breath, and pumping my leg even harder. My thigh started to feel warm and wet, and I knew it wasn't just the friction or the sweat that was causing it.<br><br>Her moans changed to inarticulate cries and shouts as she finally brought herself to orgasm. Her whole body seemed to shudder, then freeze, then slump in post-orgasmic exhaustion. She kissed me on the lips, on the cheeks, on the eyelids, and on the forehead, before finally disengaging and slumping down onto the grass, her eyes closed and a look of ecstatic bliss on her face. I stood there, looking down at her in stunned bemusement - I had just had my first experience of ponygirl sex! I had to admit that it left me feeling incredibly aroused!<br><br>A movement caught my attention, and I looked up to see Scarlett staring back at me, glancing down at the prone girl, her face a mask of confusion, alarm and, I'm pretty sure, disgust. She backed away into the far corner of the paddock, retreating as if I were coming at her with a knife. It looked like the pretty, young redhead would not be interested in joining in any forthcoming pony ‘games’!<br><br>Still feeling very horny, but realising that I wasn't going to get any satisfaction from my companions, at least not at the moment, I looked around the paddock and surrounds for some distraction. The paddock was set up in a large grassy field which was bounded on three sides by thick woods and on the other side by the large building where I had been ‘processed’ earlier in the day. The door through which I had originally entered was at one end, and the path leading away from the door went up to the hotel in the distance. On the side of the building facing us were two large, sliding wooden doors, closed at the moment, hiding the interior.<br><br>The only other things of interest were two shiny, stainless steel troughs against the fence at the side of the paddock, but they were empty and I didn't pay them much attention. So, all in all, not a lot to look at. The only things of real interest were Scarlett, who had sat down in the corner furthest away from me with her back against the fence and her knees drawn up in front of her protectively, and Scheherazade, who was still lying on the grass, a satisfied grin across her face. I turned away and leaned on the fence, watching the sunset.<br><br>Just then, the side door of the building opened, and a very attractive woman stepped out. She was wearing a figure-hugging black cocktail dress and high heels, and her hair and make-up looked perfect. I wondered what she was doing here, when she turned towards us with a smile.<br><br>"Good night, ponies," she called out, waving her hand, "see you in the morning!" As she started to walk up the path towards the hotel, it slowly dawned on me that this was Belle - or, at least, the woman who had been Belle. She must have signed up for ‘Sessions’, I reasoned, and was now going off to enjoy the luxury of the hotel. I wondered, rather nervously, what the three of us had to look forward to.<br><br>As I watched her walk up the path, I saw another woman, dressed in a stripy chef’s apron, coming the other way. She was carrying a bucket and, rather than going into the building as I had expected, walked up to the paddock, smiling at me as she did so. She went to the side of the paddock and, putting the bucket down on the ground, picked up a hosepipe from the grass. She put the nozzle through the fence and draped it into one of the steel troughs, before turning it on and filling the trough with water.<br><br>She turned off the hose and put it back on the ground, then picked up the bucket and emptied it into the other trough.<br><br>"Here you go, ponies," she said with a pleasant tone, "dinner is served. Come and get it!" As the woman walked away, whistling to herself, I stared in dismay at the trough, now filled with salad, vegetables, potatoes, pieces of chicken, the odd bit of steak, and God knows what else. So much for Michelin-starred dining, I thought, it looked like we were going to be fed on scraps!<br><br>As I just stood there, gazing in disbelief at what we were expected to put up with, Scheherazade crawled over on her hands - I mean her hooves - and knees and, without a moment's hesitation, stuck her head into the trough and began munching away at the food. She started to make appreciative ‘mmmmm’ noises, and I suddenly realised just how hungry I was. Ignoring my feelings of humiliation at being treated like this, I walked over and got down alongside her, sticking my face in and trying to get the food into my mouth with my lips, tongue and teeth.<br><br>As I gradually assuaged my hunger pangs, I admitted to myself that, actually, the food was very good. I was enjoying the dressing on the salad, and the bits of meat that I had managed to find and chow down on were beautifully cooked and seasoned. Okay, it was rather humiliating to be eating leftovers out of a trough, but I knew I wasn't going to starve here. In fact, I was soon completely full.<br><br>I finally raised my head and noticed that Scheherazade was now looking at me and, as well as the broad smile on her face were bits of food, and her cheeks and chin were slick with oil from the salad dressing. I was sure that I looked just as messy, and I smiled back at her to acknowledge the fact. Moments later, we were laughing as we licked each other clean. We moved away from the trough, allowing Scarlett to move in and get her meal without having to squeeze up against us, which had clearly been the reason she had been hanging back.<br><br>My new friend and I shuffled across the paddock on all fours, but it was obvious that the black girl was in a playful mood, and we had only gone a couple of yards, all the time rubbing hips and shoulders, when she deliberately bumped me hard, knocking me onto my back. Before I knew it, she was kneeling over me, not face-to-face, but face-to-crotch! She pushed my legs wide apart and then lowered herself onto me, and we were in the perfect 69 position.<br><br>I let out a wail of a surprise as I felt her tongue on my pussy lips, and then her mouth closing around my clitoris, her tongue rolling wetly around on it. Surprise quickly turned to sky-rocketing arousal, and I was soon gasping for breath. My lover shoved her groin into my face as a reminder that there was a quid pro quo required here and, snapping out of my self-absorbed reverie, I went at my job with all the enthusiasm of the keen novice that I was.<br><br>The experience was amazing. I had never given or received cunnilingus before, but I had heard whispered stories from other girls of the ecstasy it could bring, and now I believed every word. I was involuntarily bucking my hips as Scheherazade worked on me expertly, while I tried to reciprocate, following her every move. It felt like the outside world had disappeared, and the only sounds I could hear were the ones we were making, the only thing I could see was her glistening body above me, the only sensations those in my loins. Except that those sensations seemed to bespreading across my body, making my skin tingle, becoming super-sensitive, to the point where it seemed that I could feel the grass growing beneath me!<br><br>It gradually became clear that Scheherazade was not a beginner at this. Whenever I thought I must surely explode in orgasm, she would back off or transfer her attentions to some slightly less sensitive part of my body - my inner thighs, my lower abdomen, or the skin over my hip bones - and wait until I had come back from the brink before continuing. She also ensured that I didn't make her cum too quickly either, lifting herself away from my eager tongue whenever necessary.<br><br>I don't know how long this teasing went on, but I was fit to scream by the time she finally relented and let nature take its course. I think I did scream when I finally came, but luckily my mouth was full of cunt at the time, so I wasn't too noisy. I felt a great sense of achievement when I finally managed to make her reach her orgasm as well, and we rolled apart, lying on the grass exhausted but satisfied.<br><br>"Come on you two, time to put you away for the night." I opened my eyes and looked up to see Chloe standing over me. Embarrassed to be discovered like this, and wondering just how long she had been watching, I scrambled to my feet and followed as she took hold of one of the rings on my bridle and led me out of the paddock towards the building. Scheherazade and Scarlett were in front of me, also being led by their grooms.<br><br>The sliding doors were now open so that I could see inside, and it was immediately obvious that this was a stable block, the rooms I had seen earlier just a small part of the whole, simply ante-rooms for processing purposes. What I was facing now was a row of stalls, each with a space for a nameplate on the door, but only the first three were labelled with the words "BRIGHT EYES", "SCHEHERAZADE", and "SCARLETT SUNRISE". These were to be our stalls for the duration of our stay.<br><br>We were each led into our respective stall. When I entered mine, I saw that it was nothing more than a basic rectangle with wooden sides, the whitewashed brick wall of the building at the back and the gate-like door at the front. There was no furniture or decoration, and the floor was covered with straw rather than carpet. Assuming that I was expected to sleep here, I looked around for a bed, but there was nothing except a pile of clean straw in one corner. They really are treating us like ponies, I thought - so much for 5-star luxury!<br><br>While I had been looking around, Chloe had fetched a toothbrush and paste, and she proceeded to clean my teeth for me, before allowing me to sip some water from a plastic beaker to rinse my mouth. I leaned forward to spit into the cup, but instead, she tossed the excess water onto the floor and turned away. With little alternative, I spat onto the floor.<br><br>"Good night, Bright Eyes, sleep well." Chloe walked out of the stall and closed the door, sliding a bolt into place on the outside. I went over and checked the door, but it was just as well secured against me being able to open it as the paddock had been. I looked out into the main part of the stables and saw that all three of the stable-maids were leaving and, as the large wooden doors were slid shut, the whole place was cast into gloomy shadow. I heard a noise and looked to my left, where I saw Scheherazade leaning over the gate of her own stall. She smiled, blew me a kiss, and waved a hoof, before moving into the stall, out of my sight. With nothing better to do, I did the same.<br><br>It can't have been later than 8 o'clock in the evening, but I was tired from the excitement of the day, the strenuous exercise earlier in the field, and the strenuous sexual activity in the paddock. With no other option presenting itself, I went over and lay down on the straw bed in the corner, making myself a little nest to lie in.<br><br>Although it was a little scratchy against my bare skin, the straw was unexpectedly comfortable and I soon found myself dozing off. As I thought back over the day, which had started off on such a sour note with the revelation of Conchita’s deceit, I realised that, to my surprise, I had enjoyed it all - the dressing up, being forced to exercise more than I ever had, my sexual encounter with my sister ponygirl, Scheherazade - it had all been totally amazing.<br><br>But the most striking thing had to be the way that Chloe had treated me, not as a customer to be pampered and humoured, but as if I really was just a dumb animal to be controlled, trained and, ultimately, looked after because I couldn't look after myself. That I (or Conchita's dad) was paying good money to be treated like this felt like a huge cosmic joke. I wondered what the next day would bring, what new adventures awaited and, with such happy thoughts, I fell asleep.`

                    subtitle: "", 
                    content: `"Good morning, Devon! It's Thursday, it's 6 o'clock, and it promises to be a bright and beautiful morning! Welcome to Radio Devon and, for the next three hours, your host, Dave Cheetham!"<br><br>I woke to the tinny sound of a transistor radio playing some awful record made before I was born and sat up, groaning as pain shot through me from my aching back and sides - the straw bed had not been as comfortable as I had thought when I first lay down the night before. I went to brush the hair out of my face and bashed myself on the nose, having momentarily forgotten that my hands had been transformed into a hoof. Sleepily, I stood up and staggered over to the door, peering out into the still-gloomy stable.<br><br>The three grooms were bustling around the place, doing something or other, I don't really know what, and then Chloe walked over to my stall.<br><br>"Good morning, Bright Eyes," she said as she unbolted the door and took hold of my bridle, "I hope you slept well and are ready for a busy day!"<br><br>She led me out of the stable and over to a frame with posts about ten feet apart and a bar across the top a couple of feet above my head. She lifted one of my arms and used the clip on the strap around my forearm to attach it to the bar, then repeated with the other arm, leaving me standing there with my arms in the air, simply but securely restrained.<br><br>A couple of minutes later, Scheherazade and Scarlett were also brought out of the stable and fastened to the bar alongside me. I tried to look around at them, to give them some sort of morning greeting, but the constraints of the collar and the blinkers meant that I couldn't make eye contact with either of them, and had to just stand there and wait to see what happened next.<br><br>Chloe came back and, to my surprise, began to strip the harness off me. She pulled out the butt plug holding my tail, and I let out a squeal as my poor little sphincter was stretched painfully and then tried to close. I felt a sudden urge to empty my bowels but, clenching my buttocks tightly together, I managed to resist it. Once she had removed the body harness, Chloe then took off my bridle.<br><br>"Now, remember," she said sternly as she unbuckled the collar around my neck, "ponies don't talk, regardless of whether wearing the collar or not." She put the tack, including the collar, onto a table a little way away, alongside that which had been stripped from the other ponygirls, then went back into the stables for something.<br><br>I stretched my neck, feeling relief that it was no longer so restricted in movement, and looked over at the other girls, who were doing much the same. Scheherazade smiled at me and blew me a kiss.<br><br>"Hi," I whispered, "I'm Sarah. What's your name?" Rather than answering me, she looked horrified and tossed back her head, letting out that whinny that she seemed to have perfected.<br><br>Suddenly, Chloe came stamping out of the stables and straight up to me. Feeling rather frightened and intimidated, I saw that she was carrying a riding crop.<br><br>"Bad pony!" she shouted, and whacked me hard across the buttocks with the crop, "ponies DO NOT talk!" She hit me again and I squealed in pain. "I don't know whether you are disobedient or just stupid, but if you can't keep quiet, I’ll have to keep you quiet, won't I?"<br><br>She thrust the crop into her belt and took something from her pocket. It was a piece of rubber with a short tube and a small bulb attached. She forced the rubber, not too gently, into my mouth and began squeezing the bulb. The rubber was actually a small bladder which was now expanding rapidly, completely filling my mouth and forcing my jaws apart. Now I couldn't breathe, never mind talk, and I began snorting rather desperately through my nose, alarmed by her abrupt and rather violent treatment of me. She let go of the bulb, which hung near my chin, and went back inside. I looked over at Scheherazade, but rather than showing me sympathy, her expression was one of disappointment, as if saying ‘well, that serves you right!’<br><br>A few minutes later, all the grooms came back out, and each was carrying a large plastic bag full of a clear liquid. Chloe hung the one she was carrying from the bar just beside me and, with the long tube hanging below it, it looked like an oversized saline drip. It wasn't until I saw her putting lubricant on the nozzle at the end of the tube that I began to suspect what it was really for.<br><br>My suspicions were confirmed when she pushed the nozzle into my anus and then turned the tap at the bottom of the bag. I had the weird feeling of luke-warm water rushing into my rectum and quickly filling my bowel until I became painfully full, and my lower belly began to bulge out. I felt a desperate urge to urinate as pressure was applied to my bladder, and I had to fight to keep it in. However, when I looked to my side to see how the others were coping, I saw that Scheherazade was, without embarrassment, spraying the ground in front of her with a steaming golden arc! Realising that being embarrassed about pissing on the floor was pointless, and not something a real pony would do, I let go and felt the relief of pressure as my pee splashed into the dirt.<br><br>The stable girls busied themselves with other jobs for about a quarter of an hour, as I became more and more uncomfortable. I watched as they cleared out the old straw from our stalls and replaced it with fresh - nice to know we get clean bedding every day, I thought, the very least I would expect from a five-star hotel!<br><br>I was really grateful when Chloe returned, placing the bucket she was carrying on the ground between my legs. Without a moment's hesitation, she pulled the nozzle out of my arse, and the urge to evacuate my bowels was overwhelming. Due to my upbringing since I was in nappies, I tried to hold it in, but it was only a matter of seconds before I heard the liquid hitting the bottom of the plastic bucket. The smell was pretty disgusting, and it was obvious that there was a lot more than just water coming out of me.<br><br>Again, the relief was enormous and, when the flow finally stopped, I felt so much better and, somehow, cleaner inside. But then I felt the nozzle being forced back into me and realised that the enema was not yet finished. The bag hanging beside me was still half full, and water once more flowed into me. As the bag emptied, Chloe squeezed it until she had forced the last drop out of it and into me.<br><br>After another rather uncomfortable wait, the enema was released and Chloe took the smelly bucket away. One of the other girls moved down the line with a hose and gave us each a thorough soaking with icy-cold water, leaving me shivering and, with my hair lank and dripping, feeling like a drowned rat.<br><br>I was immensely relieved when Chloe deflated the bladder in my mouth and removed it so that she could clean my teeth. She then shampooed and conditioned my hair, before lathering me up with a soapy sponge, cleaning away the stale sweat and grime of the previous day, and the splashback from the earlier toileting. Then the other girl came back with the hose and rinsed me down.<br><br>Chloe dried me with a towel, before putting my damp hair up into the high ponytail, applying sunscreen to every inch of my body and then dressing me in my ponygirl tack once more. I braced myself when it came to reinserting the butt plug, but it wasn't as bad as the first time - I guess my poor little sphincter was getting used to being stretched all out of shape.<br><br>After what felt like hours of standing under that rail, we were released and taken over to the paddock. Breakfast was served from a bucket into the trough, just like the previous evening's dinner and, once again, it looked like we were receiving the scrapings from the guests’ plates or the leftover food from the buffet. There was a mish-mash of eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, tomatoes and mushrooms, along with cereals like muesli, cornflakes and nut clusters, as well as fresh fruit chunks, all swimming in milk.<br><br>I got down on my hands and knees and, rather tentatively, began to nibble away. It seemed that somebody had been eating pancakes, because there was the distinctive taste of maple syrup over everything. Once I’d got over the bizarre nature of the situation - three supposedly grown-up women on their knees in a field, eating waste food out of a trough - it was perfectly palatable, and I found myself wolfing it down.<br><br>Once we had finished eating, the three of us turned to each other and did our best to converse, without anyone actually speaking. The communication generally consisted of smiles, winks, blowing kisses and waving arms, but it seemed to work, and passed the time. Scarlett seemed much more friendly than the previous evening, even rubbing cheeks with me. Maybe she felt a bit left out before, with Scheherazade and me getting on so well, but we were all now best of friends again, so that was good.<br><br>We didn't have to wait long before the stable girls came over and, after restraining my arms as before and inserting the bit between my teeth, led us out of the paddock. At this point, Belle rejoined us, once more in her pony gear, looking bright eyed and bushy tailed, having presumably enjoyed a comfortable night and a pleasant breakfast. I envied her, not only for that but also for the nice warm shower she would have had, even the use of the toilet, rather than having to pee on the grass and shit in a bucket! The whole thing had been rather uncomfortable, very humiliating, and strangely erotic. On reflection, I wondered just how much I did envy her…<br><br>The morning’s training session was very much the same as the previous afternoon - walking, stepping, trotting, cantering, galloping - except harder, and for longer.<br><br>It was a sweet relief when we were led off the field and back to the paddock, the sun now high in the cloudless sky. Belle was led away once more, no doubt for a relaxing lunch, maybe by the pool. In one way I was jealous, but in another I felt that she was missing out on so much of this wild experience. Maybe she is just into the dressing up and the exercise, I thought, but I knew it was so much more to me and, almost certainly, to the other two.<br><br>I was sweating profusely, and a little bit dizzy from the heat, and I gratefully ducked my face into the trough of water as I drank as much as I could. I was disappointed to see that the food trough was empty as I was feeling quite hungry and, leftovers or not, I would have been more than happy to ‘trough down’ on it.<br><br>One corner of the paddock was under the shade of a large oak tree, and the three of us retreated under it to get out of the blazing sun. As we sat there, my eyes almost inevitably wandered over to my beautiful black companion but, even though I was having naughty thoughts about her, I was still surprised to see her sitting with her legs wide apart, lazily playing with herself, rubbing her hoof-glove against her crotch! With her amazingly muscled, ebony body glistening like latex from the sunscreen and sweat, I found myself almost drooling with pent-up desire for her. I still didn't think of myself as a lesbian - I fancied boys, I couldn't be a lesbian! - but I couldn't deny that I had the serious hots for this particular sexy beast.<br><br>She smiled when she saw me looking at her, and crawled over to me with a wicked look on her face. She pushed me onto my back on the ground, pinning my arms with her shins and, still smiling in total confidence, lowered herself until she was sitting on my face. I needed no prompting to start using my tongue on her clitoris and pussy lips, licking her around the leather strap covering her vagina. She began to rock back and forth, smearing her juices across my face as I worked hard to make her cum.<br><br>What happened next took me completely by surprise, and was totally amazing. I felt something cold and hard on my thighs, and I realised it was the metal of horseshoes touching me, pushing my legs apart. I assumed it was Scheherazade, but then - oh my God! - I felt a warm, wet tongue lick my little bud! It had to be Scarlett, and suddenly we were having a girly three-way! I thought I might cum right there and then, just from the excitement, but I managed to control myself, just a little, and could then enjoy the enthusiastic work of the redhead. Her efforts made me redouble my own as I strove to bring the woman riding me to the peak of excitement.<br><br>After a couple of minutes, Scheherazade suddenly disengaged herself from me, but it was only so that she could turn around, now facing down my body, and she pushed her wet pussy lips down onto my mouth again. I heard her making some noises and then Scarlett also repositioned herself, before resuming licking me so delightfully. As the stifled noises and squirming above me increased, I realised that Scheherazade must be licking Scarlett's pussy, meaning that all three of us were giving and getting the most amazing sensations, all at the same time!<br><br>It would have taken an unbelievable feat of organisation for us all to cum at once, but we weren't that far off. I think I came first, but it only spurred me on to greater efforts, and Scheherazade quickly reached orgasm. Scarlett was last, but only by a matter of seconds, half a minute at most. The other two fell away from me onto the grass and we all lay there, gasping for breath and enjoying the moment.<br><br>Once I had actually come back down to earth, I lay there just looking up at the leaves and branches above me, trying to come to terms with what had just happened. I tried to rationalise my feelings about this whole ponygirl thing, about the women around me, about sex, but eventually I gave up and decided to just enjoy it and let whatever was going to happen, happen.<br><br>I assumed that the afternoon training was going to be the same as the morning, but how wrong I was. We were led away to a different part of the field, and what lay before us was daunting, and a little frightening. It was a fully blown showjumping course!<br><br>When I got over my shock, I could see that it was actually specially designed for us ponygirls rather than, as I had first thought, one for real horses and ponies. The jumps were much smaller, and the rails much thinner and lighter so that, if they were hit, they would not necessarily trip up the pony. But in terms of layout, colour and design of the fences, it looked just like the real thing.<br><br>"Okay, Bright Eyes," Chloe said quietly and calmly as she attached leather reins to either end of the bit in my mouth, "you're going to go first. Don't worry, I'll be there to guide you around the course." Somehow, I didn't find this news particularly reassuring, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.<br><br>Pulling gently on the reins, she led me until I was standing in front of the first jump. Three red and white poles rose just a couple of feet off the ground - it doesn't sound too dramatic and, under normal circumstances, it would represent no challenge at all, but wearing heelless hoof-boots, it scared me witless. I was rooted to the spot, and I looked pleadingly at my trainer, silently begging her not to make me do it.<br><br>"Come on, pony," she said patiently but firmly, pulling the reins forward, "jump!" I tried to resist, but Chloe was now standing on the other side of the fence and was dragging me towards it. I knew I had no choice…<br><br>With a strangled squeal, I lifted one foot over the barrier and pushed off with the other, leaping into the air. My leading foot came down and, much to my surprise and relief, my ankle did not twist, and the horseshoe didn't slip on the ground. Suddenly I had both feet back on the ground and I was on the other side of the fence, still upright, still in one piece!<br><br>"Well done, Bright Eyes!" Chloe exclaimed excitedly, patting me on the back, "well done! Okay, let's move on to the next one." I thought jumping one fence was quite enough, but I didn't really have a choice but to do as I was told.<br><br>The second fence was a little higher, but I had gained enough confidence from clearing the first hurdle that I jumped over it with barely any hesitation. I cleared three more without a hitch, all about the same height, and I was starting to enjoy this. But then I faced another challenge.<br><br>Fence 6 was what they call a combination obstacle - two rails had to be cleared in quick succession, with only enough room for a single step in between. But, by now, I was seeing the fences as a challenge rather than something frightening. I gathered myself, took two rapid steps forward, and jumped the first obstacle. My foot touched down and I immediately pushed off, leading with my other leg over the second half of the jump. I just cleared it with both front and trailing hoof, and then I was back on the ground, breathing heavily and sweating, but receiving the praise of my trainer, which I found surprisingly gratifying. I'm a good pony! My trainer says so!<br><br>I jumped another couple of fences relatively easily, and I could see that I was nearly at the end of the course, just a couple more fences and I would have a clear round, and that thought spurred me on, not with a sense of relief that I would have survived, but with the knowledge that I would have achieved something which my groom would be proud of. Bizarre!<br><br>But it wasn't going to be that easy. The last but one fence was, I could now see, a water jump - a relatively simple rail fence, but behind it was a trench, 6 to 9 inches deep and about a yard, maybe less, wide, filled with water. I would have to leap over the water if I was to clear the fence.<br><br>I clamped down on the bit in my mouth and gathered myself. Chloe, knowing that I was now fully into this, held the reins loosely, no longer having to prompt me. I took a short run-up and leapt as far as I could, feeling like I was soaring into the void. Almost in slow motion, I reached the zenith of my jump and then began to descend, but I could see that I was going to be close, but agonisingly, just short. My hoof splashed down into the edge of the water and I squealed as my legs started to buckle underneath me. But I managed to recover and get both feet on dry land.<br><br>"Oh, good effort, Bright Eyes," Chloe said soothingly as she stroked my shoulder, "so close! Don't worry, you'll get it next time." Despite my disappointment, I knew she was right - I could do it, and I would do it, I was determined. I almost wanted to turn back and try again right there and then, but I knew that's not how this worked. I had to complete the course, and maybe I would get another chance later.<br><br>And so to the last obstacle which, to my consternation, was a triple - three fences in one! I took several deep breaths, and then went for it. I cleared the first fence easily, landing on my right hoof and bouncing up and over the second part. Except that I didn't. The front of my hoof-boot caught the top rail and sent it flying. My trailing foot then caught the next rail down and knocked that one off as well. Thrown off balance, I stumbled as I landed and, despite all my efforts, I could not take off properly. I tried to get my legs sorted out, but I crashed straight into the third element of the jump, knocking the entire structure over, sending rails flying in every direction, and me sprawling on the grass.<br><br>Chloe helped me up, wiped the soil and grass cuttings off my sweaty body, and led me back to the others. I felt like a complete failure, but I could see that Scheherazade and Scarlett were smiling, and the other trainers praised me for my efforts and skill in clearing so many of the fences on my first attempt. As Chloe continued to stroke me, her hand moving down my back to my buttocks, I gradually started to feel better about myself, and I also started to really enjoy her touch!<br><br>It was Scheherazade’s turn next, and I watched her with interest. She was magnificent! She looked so elegant as she cleared the jumps with ease, and she completed the course with a clear round, no problems. As she walked back towards us, she was barely out of breath, and she held her head high and proud as her groom brought her in. I didn't feel any jealousy, only happiness and pleasure that she was so good. I gave my best impression of a whinny in appreciation and acknowledgement of her prowess.<br><br>Scarlett didn't have such a good round. She fell twice and had three fences down in all, as well as a foot in the water. But, as she came back to our starting position, she was smiling and rolled her eyes as if to say ‘what am I like?’ I was so impressed with her attitude, and she received warm and heartfelt compliments for her effort. Scheherazade was also allowed to go up to her and pressed her body against her - our equivalent of a warm hug.<br><br>Belle was last to go. She started off easily enough over the first few fences, and then approached the combination jump but, to my surprise, she was led around it by her handler, before continuing with the following normal fences. She carried on until she reached the water jump, but then just turned for home and came back to us. It seemed as though she had been spared the difficult parts of the course, and I wondered whose decision that had been - was it the stables’ policy not to allow part-timers, as I thought of her, to try anything too risky, or had it been discussed and agreed beforehand with the woman/ponygirl? Whatever the reason, I felt that she was missing out on the challenge, and the fun, that sense of achievement at accomplishing something you didn't initially think possible.<br><br>My second time around the course didn't go well. I think I must have been concentrating on the difficult jumps to come, because I knocked off the top rail of two of the simple fences which I had cleared quite easily first time around. And then I still had a foot in the water and clattered the triple combination at the end. Definitely not my finest hour!<br><br>By the time I started my third attempt, I knew I was getting tired. My muscles ached and I was struggling to lift the heavy hoof-boots to get them over the fences. Suffice it to say, I did not go clear.<br><br>"I think you've had enough for one day, pony," Chloe said as we returned to the start. I knew she was right, but it still rankled and left me with a feeling of defeat. "Never mind, you can try again another day." A little bit depressed, I trudged back to the paddock with the others.<br><br>Dinner was the same as the previous evening and, afterwards, we were all too tired to do anything but sit and doze until we were taken into our stalls. Remembering my discomfort from the morning, I pushed as much straw as I could together to plump up my ‘mattress’ before lying down to sleep.<br><br>As I drifted off into the land of Nod, images, thoughts and feelings of the day ambled through my tired brain, gradually lulling me into a warm and contented slumber. Despite the weirdness of what I was experiencing, I was loving every minute of it!`

                    subtitle: "", 
                    content: `What had been so unusual and exotic the previous morning was now established as routine. Being stripped, washed, toiletted and re-dressed, then being put in the paddock for breakfast were all as before. The morning training session was also the same, although it seemed that, as we got fitter, the training became more intense, really pushing us to the point of exhaustion.<br><br>What could never be routine, however, were the games the three of us played when we were left alone in the paddock. I had seen the phrase ‘ponyplay’ before, and it seemed the perfect description of what we were doing. There was much touching although, because we didn't have the use of our hands, this took the form of rubbing our bodies, slick with suncream and sweat, together – breast to breast, thigh to thigh, loins against buttocks, bosom against shoulder blades, all were incredibly sensual, erotic and arousing.<br><br>There was a lot of kissing, licking and sucking going on as well of course, much of it sexually charged, targeting mouth, breasts, nipples or clitoris, but not all. As with the rubbing together, a lot of it was for reassurance, comfort after a bad fall or a tough training session, or just because it looked like the other girl needed it. This might be delivered as a kiss on the shoulder, stomach or buttock, depending on what was easily accessible at the time.<br><br>I assumed that the afternoon would be taken up with further circuits of the showjumping arena, and I prepared myself mentally for the challenge - I was definitely going to get that perfect score today! However, Chloe and the others had something completely different planned for us.<br><br>The reins were fitted to the bit,  but we were only taken to the stables, where we were ordered to stand and wait. The girls went inside and then a few minutes later emerged, pulling a small, two-wheeled buggy! They brought it over to where we were standing and then went back inside, bringing out two more. I looked around and realised for the first time that Belle had not joined us after lunch - she obviously wasn't going to be included in the afternoon's activity. So there was one small carriage for each of us!<br><br>Chloe led me to the end of the long metal poles - traces, I think they're called - which protruded forward from the buggy, and between which the pony - or, in this case, ponygirl - would be harnessed. The buggy itself was little more than a bench seat, wide enough for one person, and a footplate, with a wheel at either side. The only other thing I noticed, although it did attract and hold my attention, was a vertical metal tube on one side of the seat, which held a long riding whip. I didn't fancy that being used on me!<br><br>I could see that the shafts were joined by a wide leather belt. Chloe lifted the shafts and backed me between them until the belt was against the small of my back. Three buckles fastened the belt tight across my stomach and hips. Chloe unhooked my wrists from my shoulders, reattaching them to the shafts on either side, and there I was, harnessed and ready for action!<br><br>I tested the weight of the buggy, taking a step forward and a step back, turning a little to one side and then back the other way. It turned out that it was quite a light contraption, and pulling it was no more work than pulling a wheelbarrow, or a couple of suitcases heading through the airport. I saw that Scheherazade and Scarlett had both been similarly restrained, and our trainers now led us in a line, each handler walking in front, holding the reins.<br><br>We came to a path which stretched away in either direction, and we were led out onto it. It was a kind of compacted light-coloured dirt, quite smooth, and I found the buggy easier to pull than on the grass. Chloe drew me to a halt and then put the reins over my shoulders, before walking behind me. Instinctively, I tried to look around to see what she was doing, but the collar prevented me turning my head, the harness of the cart prevented me turning my body, and the blinkers prevented me from seeing anything except what was in front of me - it made me realise that I was even more restricted than I had been before in the training sessions.<br><br>I heard the squeak of springs behind me, and the shafts of the cart to which I was attached swung upwards, taking me by surprise for a moment before I recognised what was happening - Chloe had climbed into the seat of the buggy.<br><br>"Walk on," I heard from behind me, and I felt the touch of the whip against my buttock, not hitting me, just prompting me to move. As soon as I stepped forward, I could feel the extra weight behind me, and I had to lean forward and strain somewhat to get the thing moving.<br><br>Once the wheels were rolling and we were in motion, I walked along the path relatively easily, although it did require extra effort to pull the driver as well as the cart. But then I felt the left rein shortening, pulling the bit between my teeth to one side, making me choke a little on the plate on my tongue, and making the metal bar dig painfully into the corner of my mouth. I tried to alleviate the discomfort by turning my head, and by twisting in the harness, but the tension on the rein was maintained. Unable to do anything else, I swerved the whole cart to the left until I was moving across the path as much as along it. At this point, I was relieved to feel the tension released, and the bit stop cutting into me. I had clearly just completed my first turn.<br><br>I wondered whether I should straighten up and head down the centre of the path, as I had been doing before, but I was nervous that this would only result in another painful correction. But we were running off the edge of the path, and I was actually on the grass, although the wheels of the cart were, just, still on the smooth surface. At that moment, the right rein was tugged and, responding a little more urgently, I turned to the right until the pressure stopped. Now I was veering across the path to the other side.<br><br>We proceeded in this fashion for quite a while, and it was obvious that Chloe was doing this to teach me about responding to her commands, transmitted through the reins. When she felt that I was obeying as quickly as possible, without hesitation, she straightened us up and we continued down the path until we reached a T-junction. I waited for the silent command, and then turned to the left as ordered.<br><br>"Giddyup!" I heard, and felt the reins slap against my shoulders, making me visualise a stagecoach driver in an old Western urging his horse to speed up. In response, I leaned further forward, strained harder, and moved up to a trot.<br><br>"Come on pony, giddyup!" Again, the reins flicked against my shoulders, and I forced myself to drag the buggy until I was cantering down the path, sucking in oxygen and feeling the effort in my thighs and calf muscles. Suddenly, a sharp pain across my shoulder blades told me that I had just been whipped, and not in a playful or ‘prompting’ manner - this was a serious hurry-up! She whipped me again, then a third time and, desperately, I shot forward, now running as fast as I could.<br><br>I was blowing hard, my lungs aching as spittle flew from my lips, and my muscles burning from the build-up of lactic acid, but I didn't dare to slow down for fear of the whip. I was on the point of exhaustion, my legs ready to buckle at the knees, when I felt the bit pulled sharply back in my mouth.<br><br>"Whoa!" came the command. Gratefully, I began to slow, working out as I did so how to counter the momentum of the carriage, which was now pushing me forward rather than me pulling it. Finally, we reached a halt and I stood there, gasping for breath, desperately hoping that that was the end of a lesson I would not have to repeat anytime soon.<br><br>"Well done, Bright Eyes, you did very well." Chloe was standing in front of me, mopping the sweat from my brow, and the drool from my chin and breasts, with a cloth. She held up a plastic bottle and squirted cool, sweet water into my mouth, which I drank greedily, then into my face and over my head. It was so refreshing that I was pathetically grateful to the young girl, almost forgetting that it was she who had driven me so hard, and whipped me so mercilessly. It was strange - I feared her and loved her at the same time.<br><br>As I started to recover, I looked around as best I could, and noticed that we were close by the showjumping ring. There was a ponygirl there being led around the course, and I realised that it was Belle - so this is what she's doing, I thought, rather than the carriage driving. It struck me how quickly things change - yesterday, jumping over fences had seemed so extreme and yet now, when I was being made to gallop along pulling my trainer in a cart, it seemed so safe and easy. Funny how your perspective can change in a trice.<br><br>Chloe mounted the buggy again and, with a flick of the whip and a slap of the reins, the drive continued. I could hear the other ponies and traps behind me but, of course, I didn't see them, so had no idea how they were getting on - I was in my own little world, concentrating only on the subtle changes in the tension of the reins, trying to detect any command before it resulted in pain. I was brought up to a gentle canter this time, which I was able to sustain for much longer without becoming distressed.<br><br>And so it went on, following these paths around the property, never having to double back on our tracks, indicating that the hotel and stables were set in quite a considerable acreage of grounds. From what I saw, it was largely fields and pastures, some fenced and containing cattle or sheep, but my view was so restricted that I never got a clear impression of the whole place.<br><br>From the bends and turns in the path, and from the pain in the left side of my mouth, I guessed we were going in a generally circular or square route and, at one point, I got a view of the hotel to my left, indicating that we were going round it.<br><br>At another point further on, we must have approached closer to the hotel, because I could hear the sound of voices, and splashing, quite close by. We were going past a row of Poplar trees to my left at the time, and I desperately hoped that these were hiding us from view, because I was sure that, only a few yards away, quite a large number of people were chatting and playing by the pool!<br><br>The thought that ‘ordinary’ people might be looking at me in my ponygirl harness, pulling a cart, gave me strangely mixed feelings - part fear, part humiliation and embarrassment, and a combination of fluttering in my stomach and tingling in my pussy which signalled extreme arousal.<br><br>But there were no cries of surprise, no people rushing to find out why a naked girl with a tail in her arse was going by, so I guessed they didn't see me. We were soon out of earshot, and a sense of relief washed over me - accompanied, maybe, by just a hint of disappointment. These reactions shocked me - what kind of pervert was I turning into?<br><br>By the time we returned to the stables, I was dead on my feet and the afternoon was fading. I pulled the cart into the stable block, where Chloe released me and led me, along with Scheherazade and Scarlett, to the paddock. I slumped to the ground, sprawling on the grass as if someone had shot me to put me out of my misery. If only they would, I thought momentarily, but it wasn't serious - I knew the aches and pains I was feeling would pass, sooner or later, and my enjoyment would return.<br><br>After a few minutes, I managed to drag myself up onto my elbows, and I saw that, while Scarlett looked as shattered as me, Scheherazade seemed fine - a little red in the face and sweaty, but standing and looking down at us piteously. I began to suspect that this was not her first time pulling a buggy or, indeed, her first time as a ponygirl - she just seemed too familiar with the routine, too fit, and just too damn good at everything!<br><br>I stared at her in wonder, once more mesmerised by the tone of her muscled body and the swell of her succulent breasts. Unable to stop myself, I got to my feet and staggered over to her, bending down and taking one of her nipples into my mouth, running my tongue around it, feeling it become stiff. She just stood there, as if condescending to allow me to pleasure her in this way.<br><br>I sucked her other nipple before, as if too tired to stand, I slid down her slick body, falling to my knees, until her plump vulva were before me. I set about kissing and licking her hot flesh and erect clitoris as ardently as I imagined I would snog a boyfriend - that is, if I ever had a boyfriend, rather than just the quick wham-bam-thankyou-mam which was my sole sexual experience before coming here. Although, the way things were going, it looked like I was destined to be a lesbian, given my reaction to the dark-skinned beauty I was currently pleasuring.<br><br>I couldn't wait to hit the hay, as it were, after we had eaten our delightful meal of table scrapings and kitchen rejects. Almost as soon as I lay down on my straw bed, I was asleep, and I didn't stir again until the tinny blare of the transistor radio trumpeted the wonders of the new day into my sleepy brain.<br><br>There was a change to the start of the morning routine that day. Chloe had dressed me in my harness and bridle after cleaning me and, as she released one of my arms, I assumed I was about to be taken out to the paddock as usual. Instead, she left my other arm restrained against the bar above my head whilst she unbuckled the strap around my forearm and removed the hoof-glove, releasing my hand for the first time in three days. To say I was surprised would be an understatement - what was going on?<br><br>Chloe manipulated my wrist and fingers, gradually working out the stiffness that had built up from being largely restricted for such a long time, and I couldn't help groaning at the discomfort this induced. Once movement was pain-free, she carefully washed the newly-exposed skin and trimmed my nails. Finally, she applied hand cream and then replaced the hoof, strapping it on tight and restraining it once more above me. She repeated this on my other hand, before moving on to my feet.<br><br>She stood behind me and lifted my leg, holding it tight between her thighs, then unlacing the boot and pulling it off my foot. She manipulated my ankle as she had done my wrists, but this was much more painful as they had been held at exactly the same angle the whole time I had been wearing the boots. I cried out as she twisted my foot into positions which, while perfectly normal, initially felt like she was breaking my ankle. This manipulation took much longer and, once she had washed the foot and checked my toenails, she spent several minutes massaging cream into the sole and heel, which felt absolutely divine. I groaned when I felt her pulling the boot back on, knowing that the discomfort would gradually return. Without a word, she went on to ‘treat’ my other foot.<br><br>The morning session was spent pulling the buggy rather than the circuit training we had done the previous two days. While the work was more interesting, in that I got to see my surroundings - at least, that bit I could see between the blinkers on either side of my face - it was much harder, harder even than the first session the previous afternoon. It was clear that Chloe was working to build up my strength and stamina but, by the time we stopped for the midday break, I was completely spent, and could do nothing but lie on the ground and doze.<br><br>The afternoon was worse. I was led to some other part of the property and, as I was turned sharply to the left, I found myself looking at a large, grassy hill. There was no path leading to the hill, or up it, but Chloe made me turn onto the grass and trot towards it. Pulling the cart across the uneven surface of the field was much harder than it had been on the path, and then I felt the ground beneath me begin to rise.<br><br>I was soon reduced to a walk and, as the slope became steeper, just moving forward became more and more difficult. I dug the toe of my ‘hooves’ into the dirt and put all my effort into the climb while, at the same time, trying to cope with the ‘encouragement’ I was receiving.<br><br>“Come on, Bright Eyes, you can do it!” Chloe was urging from behind as she slapped me with the reins, then lashed me harshly with the whip. I could feel the edge of the leather harness belt cutting into the skin of my abdomen and over my hips but, in response to the whip, I strained even more, keeping the buggy inching onwards and upwards.<br><br>Suddenly, I heard a noise to my right and, a few moments later, I saw the legs of Scheherazade and the wheels of her cart as they passed me on the way to the summit. She seemed to be having little difficulty, striding purposefully up as if she were still on the flat, and I envied her supreme fitness.<br><br>Eventually, somehow, I made it to the top, and felt the reins pulling me to stop. I was gasping for breath and my muscles were aching, but I’d made it! Chloe dismounted and came around to spray water in my face and into my gaping mouth, making me cough horrendously as I accidentally breathed it instead of swallowing it. As I stood there feeling like I was about to expire, I looked over at my fellow ponygirl, only to find that she hardly even seemed to be breathing hard as she calmly stretched her legs, as if getting ready to do it all again. I came very close to hating her at that point!<br><br>Just then, I heard a cry from somewhere behind me, and realised that Scarlett was still struggling her way up. There were further cries, and then the sound of a whip cracking, followed by forlorn sobbing. A couple of minutes later, one of the grooms appeared, leading her pony by the reins. The girl took a bottle of water and hosed Scarlett with it, rubbing the dirt off her knees to reveal a nasty graze, which was bleeding down onto her boot. I felt a surge of empathy for the redhead, whilst simultaneously feeling guilty about my earlier self-pity.<br><br>I saw Scheherazade move forward in response to her driver’s prompt and begin the descent. A moment later, I felt Chloe get back into the buggy behind me and take up the reins, flicking them to signal me to move off and follow. Despite my aches and pains, I obeyed, falling into line behind the other carriage as it wound its way down the hill.<br><br>Going down revealed a whole new bunch of terrors to those of the ascent. The weight of carriage and driver kept pushing me forward, threatening to trip me and send me sprawling under its wheels as it rolled over me. I fought against it but, eventually, I couldn't hold it back any longer, and I was running uncontrollably down the slope, desperately trying just to get my feet on the ground without tripping or twisting an ankle. I felt the reins yanked back, but it had no effect, there was nothing I could do! I was terrified!<br><br>I was only saved by the fact that we reached the bottom of the hill and the ground below my flying feet levelled out. Gradually the cart and I slowed down, from a gallop to a trot and, finally, to a stop. My legs gave way beneath me and I fell to my knees, shaking from the adrenaline which had been pumping furiously around my system.<br><br>"There, there, pony," Chloe said calmingly, stroking my head, "it's all over now. You did very well." My heart was still pounding in my chest but my reaction, rather than one of terror or relief, was one of triumph - I had survived! Suddenly, rather than my worst nightmare, it seemed I had experienced the ride of a lifetime, the most incredible rollercoaster ever invented. I felt like some kind of danger junkie - I could do that again! I saw my Black Beauty, still as cool and calm as ever, turning and making her way back up the hill, and, quickly sobering up, I realised that I was going to have to do it again, whether I wanted to or not.<br><br>It did get easier. The climb was a struggle every time, getting harder as I got tired, but I managed to get control of the descent so that it wasn't actually life-threatening, for me or Chloe, and I got to enjoy the freedom of ‘letting go’ near the bottom. On what proved to be the last time down, Chloe whipped the reins against my back at the bottom of the slope, turning the free running into a fast gallop as we headed back to the path and, from there, all the way back to the stables.<br><br>As I lay back on the grass in the paddock, once more totally exhausted, Scheherazade crawled over, smiling down at me, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She leaned down and kissed me, but I was honestly too tired to respond.<br><br>I was also too tired to respond when she sucked on my nipples but, when she moved further down, I couldn't help but begin to react to the insistent probing of her tongue. I still couldn't move, but my moans of arousal told her that I was definitely enjoying what she was doing, and she swung herself around and lowered her crotch into my face.<br><br>I managed to summon up enough energy to return the compliment she was paying me and, as my arousal grew, so my efforts began to match my enthusiasm. Soon, we were both whimpering and moaning ecstatically and, with a sudden discovery of hidden resources, I flicked her over so that she was now lying beneath me and I was in control. Except that, of course, I wasn't in control - certainly not of myself, as I was overwhelmed with a joyous orgasm, and it took all of my rapidly dissipating reserves of energy to bring her, screaming, to the same state. I fell on top of her, too tired even to roll off, and our hot, sweat-soaked bodies lay together for the longest time.<br><br>Supper and stabling for the night brought another hard but exciting day to an end. As I lay there, I was amazed that it had only been three full days since Conchita and I had arrived here. I wondered what she was doing at that precise moment. Whatever it was, I knew it couldn't be as intense or as exhilarating an experience as I was having. I felt that she was missing out, and I couldn't wait to tell her all about it when we next met. I fell asleep thinking about how astonished she would be, and wondering if she would be jealous…<br><br>Next morning, the radio told me that it was now Sunday, and it was going to be another long, hot day of this glorious summer. As we were hitched to our buggies and walked out into the early morning sun, I knew it was going to be a gruelling day as well. Chloe had me trot across the field to the path, and she made me do some light exercise, alternately walking and trotting, just to warm up for half an hour or so.<br><br>When we returned to the stable block, I was astonished to see that the paddock was full of ponygirls! There were about ten or a dozen women of various ages, ranging from my age to thirties, I would guess, in full tack, although they were all wearing some clothes - mostly in bikinis, some in lingerie, and a couple in full body suits, including hoods which covered their face, which looked horrendously hot in this weather. I wondered where they had all come from, and what they were doing here.<br><br>I guessed that these were weekend ponies - here just for the day to ‘play’ at being ponygirls - not ‘serious’ like the three of us! - or maybe this was a taster session, to see if they wanted to take it further. I noticed that Belle was among them, and we exchanged a smile and a nod of greeting. The other ponies - I mean women - were very excited and curious about the three ponygirls pulling the carts, and the grooms who were looking after them had to keep reminding them that "ponies don't talk!", although I noticed they didn't punish them - I guess that wouldn’t have been a good way to enthuse them about the whole ponygirl experience!<br><br>A crowd of other people now arrived at the paddock. Probably a dozen or so men and women, they were dressed normally, and they lined up at the rail, looking at the ponygirls and calling out to them. The ponygirls each made their way over to one of the people and, from the way the normally dressed people were talking and stroking the ponies, I assumed they were boyfriends or girlfriends come to see and admire their partner in all their ponygirl finery.<br><br>A group of three, a man and two women, were being led towards us by Chloe, who must have dismounted and gone over there whilst I was distracted, staring at the scene in front of me. With a jolt of surprise, I realised that one of them was Conchita!<br><br>"Sir, ladies, here are your ponies," Chloe said as the small group approached, "they are yours for the day, to do with as you see fit. We have provided food and drink for you, and water for your pony, in the sulky. Please feel free to explore the grounds. If you have a question, encounter a problem, or get lost, please use the walkie-talkie provided to contact us and we will sort it out. Enjoy your time with us!"<br><br>Conchita came up to me and stroked my face, feeling the way the bit stretched my lips, and how the bridle straps felt against my skin.<br><br>"My word, Bright Eyes," she said huskily with a smile, her hand dropping to my breasts and fondling them quite openly, "you do look fine! I'm really going to enjoy this!"<br><br>"Your pony is most beautiful!" The other woman was now standing alongside Conchita, looking at me appraisingly. She was dressed quite formally in a white blouse and calf-length skirt, compared to Conchita, who was just in a T-shirt and shorts. She was also wearing brown leather gloves and leather boots, which gave her the look of a horse rider. With her long, straight black hair down her back, her good looks, tall slender frame and perfect make-up, as well as her French accent, she came over as extremely sophisticated and confident.<br><br>"Hi, my name is Marianne, I'm the owner of Scheherazade here." Owner? I was rather shocked by the term, and wondered exactly what it meant. "Have you been here before?"<br><br>"Hello, I'm Conchita. No, it's our first time," Conchita replied.<br><br>"Why don't we team up and go out for the day together? I can show you some of my favourite places here."<br><br>"That sounds great," Conchita said enthusiastically, "and you can teach me about driving one of these little buggies, I've never done that before." The two of them walked out of my sight behind me, and I felt the sulky move as Conchita took her seat.<br><br>I was feeling really confused at this point - I hadn't imagined that my ‘friend’ would be driving me around, and I had no idea how to react - should I be affronted at this abuse of our friendship? Should I try to rebel? I had to remind myself that I was still in pony gear, harnessed to a cart. I didn't have a lot of options and, anyway, I was enjoying being a ponygirl, and had been expecting to spend the day being driven. Did it really matter if it was a friend doing the driving rather than a stranger? My doubts and confusion soon had to be put to one side as things moved rapidly.<br><br>"Okay," I heard Marianne say from behind me, "take up the reins and flip them against your pony to indicate that she should walk on." The reins duly slapped against my shoulders, and I took up the weight of the buggy, moving forward.<br><br>"Now, the left rein," Marianne went on, "and she'll turn, taking us onto the cart track." As the bit dug into the corner of my mouth, I turned the buggy and made my way to the path. Conchita struggled to get me going in a straight line, tugging the bit this way and that for a while but, eventually, she got the hang of it.<br><br>"Hey, this is really cool!" she exclaimed excitedly.<br><br>"It is good fun having your own pony, isn't it?" Marianne called out from alongside us, "let's try going a little quicker, shall we? Giddyup, Scheherazade!" My ponygirl friend appeared in my field of vision as she pulled her cart ahead of me.<br><br>"Giddyup, Bright Eyes!" I heard from behind, accompanied by a flick of the reins, and I began to trot. We made our way along the path, before reaching the T-junction where we had always previously turned left. However, Marianne steered the buggy ahead to the right and, for a few moments, I had the magnificent sight of Scheherazade and her sulky in profile, trotting along in front of me. But then Conchita was pulling on my reins and I was making the turn, still maintaining my trotting pace.<br><br>There, ahead of us, was a wonderful sight. The track widened into an avenue cut through the trees, rising towards a small, white structure on a hill. It was a folly, as you would see in the grounds of a stately home, a fake Greek temple, probably built by some Victorian landscape gardener to entertain the rich landowner.<br><br>"Okay, shall we see what these ponies can do?" Marianne called out. "Hold your reins in one hand, Conchita, and then pick up the whip!" I heard the distinctive crack, and the sulky alongside me shot forward as the beautiful black girl responded.<br><br>"Come on, Bright Eyes! Catch them up!" Conchita shouted and, at the same time, I felt the whip lash across my back. For a second, I had thought that she would hold back, struggling with the idea of hurting her friend, but that certainly wasn't the case! She hit me harder than Chloe ever had, and I felt the sting of the blow burning across my skin. I leapt forward in startled response, trying desperately to draw level with the other buggy.<br><br>But, it seemed, I wasn't trying hard enough, because Conchita hit me again and again, urging me to go faster. The ground was rising as we began to climb the incline, and I knew I had no chance of catching my super-fit friend. Still, as the whip now played across my buttocks, I forced myself to even greater efforts in the lost cause.<br><br>I think Scheherazade, or more likely Marianne, took pity on me. They slowed their pace until I could catch up, and we continued at a canter rather than a gallup.<br><br>"Don't be too hard on your pony, Conchita," I heard Marianne chiding, "Scheherazade here is the fittest animal I've ever seen, so it's no wonder if your poor little thing can't keep up."<br><br>At last, we reached the top of the hill and slowed down to a halt by the Greek temple.<br><br>"Water your pony, Conchita," Marianne said, walking around in front of Scheherazade and squirting water into her mouth and face. My friend, now my driver - perhaps my owner? - did the same for me, to my great relief.<br><br>The two women walked us forward and wrapped our reins around a hitching post, like you see in an old Western movie, then unloaded a couple of picnic baskets from the sulkies and sat down on the grass before us, in front of the temple. The baskets contained all manner of delights, including wine, cheese, crisp French bread and fruit. My mouth watered at the sight, and my tummy rumbled, but there was nothing for us. I was really starting to feel the separation now, between them, the people in charge, and us, the ponies. A sense of powerlessness began to overwhelm me.<br><br>"So, what is your relationship with this one?" Marianne asked conversationally, waving her glass of wine in my direction.<br><br>"Oh, we're just friends," Conchita replied, once she had swallowed the food in her mouth.<br><br>"Friends?" Marianne smiled, one eyebrow raised quizzically, "interesting. You are ‘just friends’, yet you are staying in a very comfortable hotel whilst she sleeps on straw in a stall. You enjoy fine dining while she eats your discarded leftovers. You spend your days relaxing by the pool, while she is trained to obey the bit and the whip, wielded by you. Is this how friendship works here?"<br><br>"Hey, it was her idea to come here!" Conchita responded rather defensively.<br><br>"I'm not criticising," the Frenchwoman said soothingly, "I merely point out that, perhaps you should re-evaluate your situation."<br><br>"How do you mean?" Conchita asked, brow furrowed.<br><br>"She is performing the role of ponygirl," Marianne continued, "she has submitted herself to this harsh training regime, and now she submits to being driven by you. That gives you a responsibility, no? What role will you play?"<br><br>"What do you suggest?"<br><br>"That is for you and her to decide, I think, not for me to suggest." They continued to eat in silence, Conchita looking at me thoughtfully. I wondered what she was thinking, as all this talk of submission had got me quite aroused!<br><br>When they had finished their lunch, Conchita and Marianne watered us again, before spending the afternoon driving us around the pretty grounds of the hotel. It was hard work, but manageable and, thankfully, Conchita's use of the whip was sparing. As we trotted or cantered along, I saw the ‘weekend’ ponygirls at various times. Some were being walked or taught to step by their partners, several were down at the showjumping arena, trying out jumping the fences, and a couple were hooked up to sulkies and being introduced to the wonderful world of cart driving. They all looked as though they were having fun and, despite the aches and pains in my chest and muscles from the effort required to pull the weight of a cart and rider up hill and down dale, so was I!<br><br>As, late in the afternoon, we finally returned to the stables, I saw Scarlett with her partner, the young man I had rather fancied earlier in the day. He dismounted and went around to her, speaking quietly while he gently fondled her breasts, then kissing her on the forehead and turning to return to the hotel. When we got closer, I could see that the redhead was smiling, breathing heavily, her cheeks red with what looked like more than just exertion. I guessed she had had a good day as well.<br><br>Scheherazade and I took the carts back into the stables, where our grooms unharnessed us and led us out to the paddock. When I looked back, I saw that Marianne and Conchita were deep in conversation, then they called over Chloe and asked her something. She looked over at us and then nodded. I wondered what was going on, what plan was being hatched, but then the Frenchwoman and the Mexican walked over.<br><br>"Thank you for a very enjoyable and instructive day, Marianne," Conchita said as she looked at me with a broad smile.<br><br>"You are more than welcome, ma cherie," she replied, "I'm sure tomorrow will be even more enjoyable." The two women turned and walked away, heading back up to the hotel. I was now even more intrigued about the earlier conversation, but knew that I would have to wait to find out what was going on. That thought left me tingling with anticipation, and a little trepidation…`

                    subtitle: "", 
                    content: `I was very excited when I woke the next morning, and I wasn't disappointed! After the usual morning ablutions, I was astonished, and then delighted, to see Chloe and Scheherazade's groom wheel out a double-seat carriage, clearly designed to be pulled by two ponygirls. I was to be in harness with my fellow ponygirl and occasional sex-partner! I turned to her and saw that she was smiling just as insanely widely as I'm sure I was.<br><br>The design of the sulky, although larger, was virtually identical to the single seater. The only real difference was that a single shaft came from the middle of the seat and then branched into three, like the prongs of a Trident. I was backed in between the left and centre prongs and harnessed in place, while Scheherazade was harnessed to my right. We were then led out into the field and began a morning of intense training.<br><br>Working as a pair required a whole new skill set. We both had to move at the same pace, regardless of whether we were walking, trotting, cantering or galloping and, as we couldn't look at each other because of the blinkers, we had to develop a kind of sixth sense to understand what the other was doing.<br><br>It all became so much harder when we started to practice cornering and turning, rather than just going in a straight line. The ponygirl on the inside of the turn had to go so much slower than the other, who was frantically scurrying to get around the bend in time.<br><br>Hour after hour we practised this, starting at a walk and working our way up to top speed. I was grateful when I saw that we were returning to the stables, and I was looking forward to a drink and a rest. I got the drink, as Chloe watered me, but there was no rest for us. Marianne and Conchita walked over from the hotel as we were standing there, waiting.<br><br>"We've given them a few hours of rudimentary work as a pair," Chloe explained, "why don't you take them out for a trial?" A few minutes later, we were heading back out into the extensive grounds, initially under the control of Marianne, but then with Conchita taking the reins.<br><br>From that moment forward, we were taken out as a pair every day by Conchita and Marianne, rather than the grooms - our training period was over, and for the rest of the time there, we were used by the two women for their pleasure.<br><br>It felt different that it was them driving us rather than Chloe or one of the others. The grooms were just doing a job, albeit very professionally - they were hired hands, ultimately employed by us and answerable to us (with the proviso that it wasn't actually me paying the bills). I assumed that they were restricted in what they could make us do by some kind of health and safety regulations.<br><br>Conchita and Marianne, however, were something very different. There were no agreed limits about the use of the whip, or how long, hard or fast they could drive us. They were totally in control of us, and we had to obey or suffer the consequences. That was the thing which, somehow, made it so deliciously erotic.<br><br>The days began to merge and lose their individual identity - each started early with the toilet routine, each ended late, and in total exhaustion. I knew I was getting fitter and stronger, but it made no difference at the end of the day - we were being worked so hard that we fell into our straw beds and were asleep almost instantly. Scheherazade and I didn't even have enough energy to pleasure each other before we were put away for the night, and were reduced to lying together on the grass, just cuddling.<br><br>Wednesday was notable in that our hands and feet were once more treated to make sure there were no long-term issues with wearing the boots and gloves. Then, at lunchtime, we were driven back to the stables, which was very unusual, and brought to a halt near the side door.<br><br>A few minutes later, the door opened and out came Scarlett and her partner - although she was no longer dressed as a ponygirl, she was in proper clothes, wearing make-up, with her red hair nicely washed and coiffed. She came over to us and, smiling, stroked our faces.<br><br>"Thanks for bringing them back," she said to Marianne and Conchita, who were still sitting in the sulky.<br><br>"No problem," Conchita replied from behind me.<br><br>"Goodbye, ponies," the woman who had been Scarlett said, now looking at us, "it was fun. Thanks for including me in your little games." She kissed each of us on the forehead and then left, arm in arm with her boyfriend, walking back up to the hotel. I felt the reins pulling, and I turned away as we were driven back out into the country. I was sad to see Scarlett leave, but that was soon forgotten as I concentrated on keeping in step with the girl next to me.<br><br>When Sunday came, there was another gaggle of wannabe ponygirls milling around, but they didn't really distract me from the task in hand which was, as always, to obey the commands transmitted through the reins and the whip as quickly and accurately as possible, to satisfy our demanding drivers.<br><br>When the second Wednesday dawned, I was so sleepy that I didn't realise it was anything special. But, as Chloe led me out of the stables and round to the side door, it finally sank in - this was it, my last day! I sat there in a bit of a daze as Chloe stripped me of my bridle, harness, tail, gloves and boots, before handing me a towel and leading me to the back of the room, where there was a set of showers. Under one of them, to my surprise, was Scheherazade!<br><br>"Hey there, Sarah," she said, smiling and holding out a wet hand, "come and join me. How does it feel to be human again? My name’s Tanya, by the way." I put down my towel and stepped into the shower alongside her, enjoying it when she pressed her warm, wet body against me. Suddenly, our hands were all over each other and we were kissing for all we were worth. Long story short, we very quickly brought each other to a very noisy orgasm!<br><br>Once we had got that out of the way and recovered, we washed each other, luxuriating in the warm water and soapy suds. Eventually, we clambered out and dried ourselves, before walking back into the tack room, where we found the boxes with our names on and clothes inside. I noticed that Tanya's full name was Tanya Davies.<br><br>It felt weird to be wearing bra and panties for the first time in two weeks, and Tanya and I, appropriately enough, horsed around for ages, giggling together, looking at ourselves in the mirror and pretending we were still ponies, strutting and prancing around.<br><br>When we were finally dressed, Chloe told us that Marianne and Conchita were waiting for us at the hotel, and that we should hurry up because they were waiting to leave. I wondered what the rush was, but we hustled over there and found them waiting outside by a car.<br><br>"Come on, you two," Marianne said, "we've got a plane to catch!"<br><br>"What?!" I exclaimed, "where are we going?"<br><br>"Get in the car," she replied urgently, "we'll explain on the way."<br><br>As when we had arrived, we had to wear blacked-out sunglasses to prevent us from knowing the exact location of the stables, so it was rather odd to hear Conchita's voice so disembodied.<br><br>"I suggested to Marianne that we could all spend some time at my father's villa near Mexico City - cocktails around the pool, lazing in the sun. It is also my dad’s fiftieth birthday and he’s having a massive party, which should be fun - what do you think?"<br><br>"Sounds great to me," I said enthusiastically, "I could do with some R&R after the last couple of weeks! But I don't have my passport or any holiday clothes."<br><br>"Don't worry, Sarah, I got your mum and dad to send it to me, and I went shopping for you. What about you, Tanya?" Conchita asked.<br><br>"If Marianne says that’s what we ‘re doing," I heard Tanya say, "then it's decided. It sounds lovely! Thank you for the offer, Miss." This was such a strange answer that it made me remember how Marianne had described herself as ‘Scheherazade's owner’. Was that just a ponygirl thing, or did it extend beyond her time at the stables? I wondered again what the relationship was between these two.<br><br>The car took us straight to the airport and, after we had unloaded our luggage, we went over to the check-in.<br><br>"Good morning, ladies," the woman said, "I'm authorised to offer you a free upgrade today, but unfortunately, we only have two spaces in business class left."<br><br>"No problem," Marianne said confidently, "just put those in the names of Duchamps and Alvares, these two will be happy with economy." I opened my mouth to protest at her assumption and downright arrogance - I had never travelled in luxury at the front of the plane, and I quite fancied trying it - but something stopped me. Tanya was completely accepting of the decision, and I could see that Conchita was happy with it too. She was looking at me hopefully, maybe expectantly, clearly wanting me to go along with the idea. I closed my mouth and followed on as the others left the check-in counter.<br><br>Once through security, Marianne and Conchita headed off for the club class lounge, while Tanya and I had to make do with a drink bought from one of the shops with the little cash we had - neither of us had taken much with us when we went to the stables. We ended up sitting in the overcrowded terminal with nothing to do and not really wanting to talk together in case we were overheard. At last, we made our way down to the departure gate.<br><br>On the plane, luckily there was nobody sitting next to us, so we could chat away happily. I told her all about me and Conchita, and how she had all but tricked me into going to the stables and subjecting myself to the ponygirl training.<br><br>"Oh come on," Tanya said, "you loved every minute of it! Don't you deny it!"<br><br>"Okay," I replied, mock-reluctantly, "I can't deny that I did get some enjoyment out of it, but still! She shouldn't have tricked me! I would never have gone so extreme if I'd known!"<br><br>"And you wouldn't have got half as much out of it!" Tanya countered, "the whole thing about it is the total immersion - you can't go about it half-hearted! By the way, I have a little secret to tell you. You know those high-tech collars they made us wear? Complete bullshit!"<br><br>"What do you mean?" I asked in confusion, "when I tried to talk, the collar gave me a shock!"<br><br>"Oh yes, they’re shock collars," Tanya said conspiratorially, "but all that stuff about them detecting whether you're speaking or not - that's rubbish. The trainers each have a remote control and, if they see or hear you trying to talk, they press that! The technology to monitor your vocal chords and distinguish between a word and a squeal just doesn't exist!"<br><br>"So why didn't you talk to me when we were away from them?" I asked accusingly.<br><br>"That’s simple - ponies don't talk! You’ve really got to live the part, not just obey the rules because they make you!" Somehow, I understood what she meant. Nobody had forced us to go there and become ponygirls, so why should they have to force us to behave like ponygirls? It made me think rather more deeply about my recent experience, and we fell into silence for a while.<br><br>"So," I said eventually, "you and Marianne -what's that all about? Tell me the whole story!"<br><br>"Well, I went to work for a company owned by Marianne," Tanya began, "and, for a few months, everything went along normally. I've always known I was gay, and never tried to hide it. Most people don't have a problem with it, and I don't shit on my own doorstep - by which I mean, I never tried to pull anyone at work, and certainly not Marianne - she was way too important and, I thought, straight as a die. So imagine my surprise when she made the first move!"<br><br>"She asked you out on a date?" I interjected, more to express my interest in the story than to ask a question.<br><br>"Not exactly," Tanya went on, "she asked me round to her house, which spooked me a bit - I was just a junior assistant nobody and she was the boss, what could she want with me? Anyway, she sat me down and, quite calmly and coolly, explained to me that she was a Dominant, and she wanted me as her submissive!"<br><br>"Oh my God!" I squealed, making several people turn around and look. "What did you do?" I whispered.<br><br>"I asked her what she meant," she replied, "I had no idea about dominants and submissives, it was all new to me. So she explained, still in her cool and calm voice, that she wanted to strip me naked, tie me up, and make love to me!"<br><br>"Oh my God!" I squealed again, causing the same people to turn around and give me a filthy look. I apologised and turned back to Tanya, who was sniggering into her pillow. "What did you say then?!"<br><br>"You’ve seen Marianne, she's a very hot chick," she explained patiently, "what do you think I said? I said ‘yes, please’! She told me to stand up, then pulled my top off over my head and then unfastened my trousers, telling me to take them off. She then ordered me to strip out of my underwear so that I was standing naked in front of her, while she was fully clothed, looking me up and down and smiling, like she liked what she saw - that felt like the most erotic moment of my life so far! She told me to follow her, and she led me upstairs to her bedroom, where I had to stand to attention while she got out her ropes and tossed them on the bed.<br><br>"She made me lie on the bed and then tied me down, splayed out like a starfish. Then she said she was going to heighten my sensitivity by removing my other senses. I had no idea what that meant, but I let her put plugs in my ears and then a leather hood over my head, which had no eye holes. I was getting a bit nervous and a bit scared at this point, but there was nothing I could do. I just kept quiet and let her get on with it, deciding that, if it was awful or she beat me or something, I was just going to have to put it down to experience - a really bad experience, like the worst date ever.<br><br>"Anyway, to cut to the chase, she gave me more orgasms in one night than I had had in my entire life! She used her tongue, her fingers, her toys - she seemed to have every sex toy in existence! By the next morning, I was hers completely- I was happy to do anything for her, on the off-chance that she might, one day, give me another night like that. And I can tell you - she has given me many such nights!"<br><br>"So you became… what exactly?" I asked, still wondering about the relationship.<br><br>"Whatever you want to call it," she replied with a happy smile, "lovers, life partners, Domme and sub, Mistress and slave - all of those are appropriate at one point or another."<br><br>"Wow!" I breathed, overwhelmed by the depth of the link she was describing, "and when did you first go to the stables?"<br><br>"That was a couple of years ago. I never had ponygirl fantasies like you, so it came as a complete surprise when Marianne booked it without telling me, and we just turned up there. We've been back every year since, so that was my third time and, I have to say, you made it the best!" We exchanged a warm kiss, but then a troubling thought occurred to me.<br><br>"I'm sorry if our ‘messing about’ causes you two any problems," I said worriedly.<br><br>"Don't be silly! " she laughed, "Marianne knew all about it from the grooms as soon as it started, and loved the idea that we were having fun. As far as she is concerned, it seems a perfectly natural thing for ponygirls to do."<br><br>Our conversation continued, ranging across many topics, and we were firm friends by the time the plane landed.<br><br>I was very impressed when we were taken from the airport to the villa in Conchita's dad's private limousine by his driver. The property itself was on a hill overlooking the sprawl of Mexico City, and the gentle breezes provided sweet air and welcome relief from the oppressive summer heat.<br><br>The villa was set in magnificently manicured grounds, and the drive up to the main building was long and shaded by trees. As we approached the front entrance, a tall, distinguished-looking man with greying hair at the temples was waiting at the top of a flight of white steps to greet us.<br><br>"Ola, Papa!" Conchita exclaimed as we got out, running up the steps and throwing herself around him. They hugged for quite some time, before she turned to us, smiling broadly and keeping her arm around him possessively.<br><br>"Papa, these are my friends," she said proudly, "Marianne, Tanya and, of course, Sarah! Girls, this is my father, Jorge" He came down the steps and shook us all by the hand in turn, until he came to me.<br><br>"Ah, Sarah," he said warmly, "you I have heard so much about in Chi-Chi’s letters from school. All your adventures together! It is good to finally meet you." He enveloped me in a hug for almost as long as the one he had given his daughter, which was nice, but also a little embarrassing and unsettling. I wondered what exactly she had told him about me.<br><br>We went inside, having been told to leave the driver to sort out the cases, and we were served champagne, or the Mexican fizzy equivalent, by the maid, introduced as Maria. The villa was enormous, high ceilings, tiled floors, white walls, and those huge, slow-turning fan things on the ceiling rather than air conditioning. It felt wonderfully cool after the broiling heat outside.<br><br>We were taken out onto a veranda, which led to an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and it was clear that Jorge was a wealthy man, whether his money was ill-gotten or not. We sat down at a table and Marianne described her business to him, while Maria provided plates of hors d'oeuvres and topped up our drinks. It was so long since I had had an alcoholic drink, I found it quickly going to my head and, with the jetlag setting in, I began to nod.<br><br>"Pardon my manners," Jorge said, "you ladies must be very tired after your long journey. Perhaps you would care for a lie down before dinner?"<br><br>"I've got a better idea," Conchita responded, "why don't we all go for a dip in the pool?" Everyone was enthusiastic, and Conchita led us to our rooms.<br><br>"This is yours, Marianne, Tanya," she said, showing them into a large room with a king-sized bed - I was happy to see that they were being accepted as a couple here.<br><br>"This is your room, Sarah," opening the door on another beautiful space, "I've got your bag in my room - I want the clothes I bought you to be a surprise. I'll go and get your bikini."<br><br>"Here you go, honey," she said as she came back into my room with the bikini, "come out when you're dressed." Even as she held it out to me, I could see that it was going to be skimpy. When I took it and held up the scraps of material, I knew it was going to be embarrassingly skimpy.<br><br>"Chi! I can't wear this! Come back!" I protested but, with a wicked smile, she left the room and closed the door. I looked down at the almost-bikini and felt unhappy. I had been tricked again! Forced into exposing myself before strangers, just like at the stables! As the memories of that flooded back, I began to feel turned on by the thought. Maybe I needed to be pushed before I would take a risk? Gradually, the idea of having to wear this turned from one of horror and betrayal, to one of excitement and anticipation.<br><br>I stripped out of my rather stale clothes and pulled on the bikini bottom. It was, as I had suspected, virtually a thong, exposing my buttocks completely, and with only just enough material at the front to cover my shaved pussy - good job I didn't have to wax my bikini line!<br><br>The bikini top was just a band which went around me, fastening at the back and with a large shiny metal ring in the middle at the front, joining the two pieces of material barely covering my nipples, let alone the swell of my breasts. A string from the ring went around my neck to provide a minimum level of support and insurance against the whole thing just falling off.<br><br>I looked at myself in the mirror, and almost felt more exposed than if I had been naked. However, the powder blue material suited my complexion well and, apart from the completely inappropriate style, Conchita had chosen well for me. I looked hot, like some Las Vegas stripper! Taking a deep breath, I went out into the hall.<br><br>The other three were waiting for me. Tanya was wearing a classic white bikini, which just looked amazing against her dark skin. Marianne was wearing an elegant, black one-piece swimsuit, with a silk wrap tied around her waist, black sunglasses and a straw hat shading her face. Conchita was wearing a floral sundress - possibly with a bikini underneath - which seemed to me to be rather unfair, given what she had made me wear!<br><br>"You look so sexy!" Tanya said enthusiastically.<br><br>"Right back at you, kid!" I replied, "although I think I look a bit more slutty than you."<br><br>"Nothing wrong with slutty, if you’ve got the right audience!" She glanced over at Conchita, implying that she was the target audience. Really, I wondered, do I want to look slutty for her?<br><br>We went out onto the veranda and Conchita's father was there in a rather revealing speedo. I wondered if this was the fashion in Mexico, or whether he was just a lecherous old goat. He complimented us all on our appearance, but his eyes lingered on me, in what I took to be rather a rude stare, and a smile crept onto his face.<br><br>"That's a very interesting pattern of tan lines you've got there, Sarah," he said, making me look down at myself. Holy crap! I’d seen the marks, of course I had, in the mirror just now, but it had not registered, because I had been looking at the same pattern for the last two weeks, except that then it was the dark brown of the leather! Now I was hatched with white lines as if I was still wearing the pony harness!<br><br>"Oh! I-I… I, er…" I stammered, turning the deepest crimson in embarrassment. I couldn't think of any explanation other than the truth and, when I looked at my friends, nobody was coming up with anything brilliant either.<br><br>"Don't worry about it, Sarah," Jorge said, his smile broadening, "you young people get up to all sorts of things, and I'm sure I don't need to know the details!" My mortification was finally relieved when Conchita pulled off her sundress and grabbed my hand.<br><br>"Come on," she cried, "last one in the water is a loser!" She ran towards the pool, pulling me along with her, and jumped in with a squeal. Moments later, we were all in there, splashing around and laughing. The moment passed, and we spent the afternoon sunbathing, swimming, talking and drinking very fruity, but thankfully non-alcoholic, cocktails.<br><br>When, eventually, we had had as much sun as we could stand, we retreated to the cool interior, spending a couple of hours before dinner sleeping off the jetlag.<br><br>"Hey, sleepyhead," Conchita said later, poking her head around the bedroom door, "take a shower and I’ll lay out what I want you to wear tonight on the bed."<br><br>"You're the boss!" I responded, smiling at how she seemed to be enjoying the sense of power controlling my wardrobe had given her. I didn't object, it was actually quite fun.<br><br>When I returned from the ensuite bathroom after a long, luxurious shower, I saw what she had left for me and felt the heat rise in my cheeks, and also in lower regions - much lower. I picked up the underwear provided, which consisted of just a red G string thong, with the front piece shaped like a heart. I put it on and moved on to the footwear, red open-toed sandals with a one inch platform sole and four inch spiked stiletto heels. Previously, I would have struggled wearing these but, after my experience at the stables, they were a cinch. I looked at myself in the mirror, admiring the way the high heels shaped and firmed my calves and buttocks. Damn, I looked hot!<br><br>And finally, the dress. It was red and, obviously, it was backless, halterneck, low-cut, and short - very short. As I checked myself out, it reminded me of the dress I had been made to wear to the ball at school, except that this was the short version - it seemed like my dress-buying friend liked me in red. The bedroom door opened.<br><br>"My God!" Conchita smiled, looking me up and down, "you look even sexier in that dress than I had imagined when I bought it!"<br><br>"Do you want your dad to think I'm a hooker?!" I protested, hands on hips and pouting.<br><br>"Don't worry," she replied, "he loves looking at beautiful girls! I want to make this birthday very special for him."<br><br>"You don't expect me to fuck him as well, do you?!" I asked, only half-joking.<br><br>"Don't be silly!" she laughed, "I don't procure women for him, and I certainly don't intend to give you away! Come on, let's go eat." With that rather cryptic comment, she turned away and I scurried to catch her up.<br><br>The next few days were wonderfully relaxing, with most of the time spent just lazing by the pool. I was getting used to Conchita's taste in clothes, and rather enjoyed being her dressing-up doll, even when she made me wear a black latex swimsuit - it could have been so embarrassing, given that it showed every lump and bump underneath, particularly my nipples, which seemed to be almost constantly erect, what with the cold water and the wildly erotic feel of the rubber. But I think I was beyond embarrassment at that point.<br><br>At last, Saturday arrived, the day of the big birthday bash. Conchita said she had something special for me to wear - no big surprise there, I thought, it's bound to be something slutty and revealing. But I was not prepared for what came next…`

                    content: `I stared at the bed - or rather, what was on the bed - with that strange buzzing in my ears you sometimes get when you're under pressure.<br><br>"That… that's what I wore… at the stables…" I finally managed to murmur, as I struggled to breathe.<br><br>"Yes," Conchita said matter-of-factly from behind me, "I knew you enjoyed wearing it, I enjoyed seeing you wear it, so I bought it. Well? Are you going to put it on?"<br><br>It was all there - the boots, the gloves, the harness, the tail, the bit and bridle - and I had enjoyed wearing it. But this was different. Before, it was an adventure, a voyage of discovery and, to some extent, I felt like I had been tricked into wearing it. Now, I was expected to make a positive decision, to actively take part in my restraint, to confirm my submission.<br><br>It seemed like an extra step along a path I was only vaguely aware of following. Was it a step too far?<br><br>"Don't overthink it, Sarah," Conchita said calmly, "think about what you feel, what you want, and just do it!" I came to a conclusion and, before I could change my mind, I reached out and picked up the hoof-boots, turning and sitting on the bed to pull them on.<br><br>Neither of us spoke as she strapped me into the leather and metal. I didn't know why Conchita was doing this but, as the items went on, as the tail was inserted and, finally, as the bit stretched my mouth, the ‘why’ and the ‘what for’ became unimportant. I was no longer thinking as Sarah, I was Bright Eyes once more, and I had no use for reasoning or decisions, those were now somebody else's responsibility. All I had to do was obey.<br><br>"Good pony," Conchita said soothingly, taking the ring of my bridle in her hand, "good pony, Bright Eyes." As she led me to the bedroom door and out into the hall, my horseshoe-clad boots clattered on the tiled floor.<br><br>I heard the clip-clop of hooves behind me and, turning around, I was delighted to see Scheherazade, in all her magnificence, being led by Marianne. We were reunited! I was no longer nervous or worried about what would happen next because, whatever it was, I would be facing it with my ponygirl partner!<br><br>I wanted to tell her how wonderful it was to see her like this. I knew that the collar wouldn't prevent me and, while there might be punishment coming my way, I could take it. But, as I opened my mouth in excitement, I remembered the golden rule - ponies don't talk! - and knew it would be wrong to speak. Instead, I let out a joyful whinny and, to my delight, she responded in like manner.<br><br>We were led down the corridor to a side door and out into the hot, bright afternoon. Before us was a two-pony trap, similar to the one we had pulled before, but this one had four wheels and a canopy over the drivers’ seat - it made me immediately think of the Surrey with a fringe on top out of Oklahoma, a musical we had performed at school.<br><br>"That's a neat piece of kit," Marianne said appreciatively, "they have these things here?"<br><br>"You'd be surprised," Conchita replied, "you can get anything in Mexico City!"<br><br>We were harnessed to the shaft which, unlike the one at the stables, ended in a padded T-bar, to which we were strapped so that we pushed the carriage forward with our hips rather than pulling it along. The reins were fitted and we walked forward under the direction of the driver - I had no idea whether it was Marianne or Conchita, but then there was no reason why I should know, or that it should make any difference. As ponies, we just responded to the bit and the whip.<br><br>We proceeded at a walk, staying close to the villa, until I could hear the sounds of conversation, meaning we were approaching the terrace where the party guests were assembled, mingling and chatting. We were brought to a halt just before we reached the corner of the building, and Conchita jumped down and disappeared around the corner.<br><br>A couple of minutes later, she returned leading Jorge with her hand over his eyes. She brought him to a standstill in front of Scheherazade and me and, for some reason, I wasn't nervous or embarrassed that he was about to see us naked. In fact, he was about to see us at our best, our most incredible!<br><br>"Happy birthday, Papa," Conchita said, removing her hand. The look on the guy’s face was a picture! I don't think he knew where to look, but not out of embarrassment, he was just spoilt for choice! Her pussy or hers? Big white boobs, or big black breasts with nipple rings? Decisions, decisions!<br><br>"I thought you could entertain your guests by giving them rides around the gardens," his daughter prompted, waiting for him to regain his composure.<br><br>"What? Oh, yes…" he responded, finally managing to drag his eyes up to our faces, "Chi-Chi, what have you done to your friends?!"<br><br>"Oh, this?" Conchita said casually, "Marianne and I wanted to show you our appreciation for your hospitality, and I thought you would enjoy this."<br><br>"Most certainly I do," he grinned, "it combines my two major passions - ponies and naked young women! But what about Sarah and Tanya? What do they think?"<br><br>"Don't you worry about that, Sir," Marianne interjected, "Sarah and Tanya have become, for now, Bright Eyes and Scheherazade, the pair of fine carriage ponies you see before you. They obey whoever holds the reins. Please, come and take control. I'm sure you’d like to show your guests your birthday present!" Conchita and her father walked past us, and I felt the carriage move as they both climbed on board.<br><br>"Walk on! Step! Step!" Jorge’s voice rang out, and the reins slapped against my back. Scheherazade and I high-stepped out together, coping with the extra weight easily, and almost immediately being turned to our right as we cleared the end of the villa. The conversation quickly died, and I saw a group of about twenty or thirty people, men in smart casual wear and women in cocktail dresses or evening gowns, staring open-mouthed as we approached and were drawn to a halt.<br><br>Suddenly, they burst into applause and laughter, before crowding around us, talking and then stroking, squeezing, pinching, as if checking to see if we were real. I felt a hand on my pussy lips, spread by the harness strap, and almost came right there!<br><br>"Friends, friends," Jorge called out over the general chatter, "give these delightful young ponies room to breathe, please!" The crowd stepped back a little, but kept their attention very much on us.<br><br>"These two have been given to me as a present by my daughter and her very generous friend," Jorge went on, "if you will excuse me for a few minutes, I would like to take them for a ride around the gardens.”<br><br>“Don't worry, everybody," Conchita added, "when we return, you will all be able to have a go yourselves." There was a murmur of approval and excitement at this announcement, and the crowd ensured that their glasses were charged, standing back to watch the show.<br><br>We started out across the lawn at a walk, then Jorge encouraged Scheherazade and me into a trot, again eliciting a round of applause from the guests, whom we were rapidly leaving behind.<br><br>"These are magnificent fillies!" I heard Jorge saying behind me, "I never knew carriage driving could be such fun. And there’s such a wonderful view from here!"<br><br>The grounds of the villa were large, though obviously not as extensive as those at the hotel. There was really only one short stretch during which we could be whipped up to a gallop, and the rest of the circuit was done at trotting pace or at a canter. It seemed that Conchita's father was an experienced horseman, because he had no difficulty in controlling us, steering us expertly through the patch of trees at the front of the property at speed, but never putting us or the carriage in any danger.<br><br>When we returned to the terrace, a line of guests quickly formed, eager to try out the novel form of transport on offer. Two at a time and, occasionally three at a time, Scheherazade and I took the guests on a sightseeing tour of the gardens although, from the comments I heard from the drivers’ seat, the only sights being seen were our arses as we jiggled along!<br><br>This went on all afternoon and late into the evening, leaving the two of us exhausted and rather sore as a result of some over-enthusiastic use of the whip by a few of the more inebriated guests.<br><br>Canapés and finger food were being provided to the guests, and I realised how hungry I was when my tummy rumbled loudly. I wondered if we would be allowed to join the others, although I didn't hold out much hope - nothing I had experienced so far as a ponygirl led me to believe that anything but the most belittling treatment could be expected.<br><br>And so it proved. Conchita came over to me with a hessian bag and, to my surprise, not only brought it up to my face but, after removing my bit, fastened it to the bridle so that all but my eyes were covered by it. I realised that there was food in the bag, and it smelled like muesli, a mix of oats and dried fruit.<br><br>It suddenly dawned on me that this was a nosebag! I couldn't believe that they had come up with this, something even more humiliating and dehumanising than the trough of discarded food at the stables. Still, I was so famished that I gobbled as much of the dry and rather tasteless fodder as I could, even tossing my head back to throw it into my open mouth. I saw people pointing and laughing at my antics, but I didn’t care – I needed sustenance!<br><br>After ‘dinner’, there was water and then more driving, more circuits of the property, more hard work.<br><br>"I think you two have had enough," Conchita said eventually, to my great relief, "come on, let's get you out of this stuff and into your party frocks." She was just about to mount the carriage when her father put his hand on her arm to stop her.<br><br>"What are you doing, Chi-Chi?" he asked with a frown, "I thought these ponies were my birthday present. I have use for them tonight, and tomorrow - and into the future!" I was rather shocked that he seemed to think that we were his to keep!<br><br>"I'm sorry, Papa," Conchita replied, "I didn't make it clear, this was for one night only."<br><br>"One night?" Jorge exclaimed as if affronted, "I don't think so! I like my ponygirls, and I intend to keep them - permanently! After all, I am a Drug Lord!" I was terrified by the dark and evil look on his face and I saw, behind him, the look of alarm on Marianne's face. Beside me, Scheherazade seemed to be prancing nervously. Oh my God, I thought, he intends to kidnap us and keep us as ponygirls forever, suffering his sadistic cruelty and satisfying his sexual demands! I was surprised to find that this didn't scare me as much as it should.<br><br>"No, you aren't, Papa," Conchita responded in a patient voice, "you’re the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company. It's not the same thing, and you don't abduct young women into slavery."<br><br>"I could make an exception for these beautiful young things!" he said, before his face split in a broad grin and he burst out laughing. I realised that it was a joke, and I had been completely suckered in. Marianne was now smiling, clearly relieved, while Conchita was shaking her head at him disapprovingly.<br><br>"You're terrible, Papa!" she exclaimed, wagging her finger at him in mock-disapproval.<br><br>"I'm sorry if I scared you, girls," Jorge smiled, "just my little joke. I do have a request of you, though. The mayor has organised a polo match tomorrow in my honour. I was thinking how delicious it would be to turn up to the match pulled by my very own ponies! Would you be prepared to do that for me?"<br><br>"I think that could be arranged," Conchita said, jumping in before I even had time to think about a response, let alone how I would convey it. She looked to Marianne for confirmation, and she was smiling as she nodded her head. It looked as though it was decided, without reference to me or Scheherazade - which, I suppose, was exactly how it should be!<br><br>"In that case," Conchita continued, "there's no point in getting the ponies out of their tack now, we can bed them down in the barn until tomorrow." Jorge’s eyes widened at this, but he said nothing as we were turned and driven away.<br><br>"I'm sorry it isn’t a proper stables," Conchita said as we pulled the carriage into the barn. For a moment, I thought she was talking to me, but then I realised the remark was directed at Marianne, which made much more sense - it wasn't as though I had any say or choice in the matter.<br><br>"This will be fine," Marianne replied as they dismounted, "though we don't want them wandering all over the barn in the night – they might hurt themselves or break something. We need to find a way to confine them." The conversation seemed a little surreal, but I just stood and waited as I heard them moving stuff around out of my view.<br><br>It seemed to take a while but, eventually, I was released from the harness by Marianne, who took both me and Scheherazade by the bridle ring and led us to the far corner of the barn. They had rearranged the hay bales there to make a small enclosure, and we were taken inside. Conchita appeared a few moments later carrying a bucket of water and toothbrushes. She put the bucket down in one corner and, having passed Tanya's toothbrush to Marianne, removed my bit and cleaned my teeth. Then they left us there, pushing a stack of bales into place to close us in for the night. The lights were turned off and I heard the barn door being closed and locked.<br><br>It was almost pitch black in the barn, and I peered through the darkness to try and see my pony companion, but I needn’t have worried, she found me. She grabbed me in a clinch with her pony hoof hands and forced herself upon me, her lips pressing against mine as her tongue forced its way into my mouth. I say ‘forced’, but there wasn't much resistance or, indeed, any. Pretty soon, we were writhing around together on the straw-covered floor, kissing, licking and sucking each other for all we were worth. And it wasn't long before we had oriented ourselves so that we could each apply our tongue to the other’s hot and needy little clit.<br><br>It was a steamy night in the fetid darkness of our straw-walled stall. We both fell asleep eventually, but I couldn't say when, or how many orgasms I'd had by then. At some point in the small hours, I woke with a very dry throat and mouth, and crawled around the small space until I found the bucket of water, and I drank long and noisily, given that I was having to slurp and lap it up. When I had taken my fill, I crawled back to the warm body of Scheherazade, snoring gently, and cuddled up to her before dozing off into a contented sleep.<br><br>The next morning, Marianne and Conchita took us through a rather curtailed routine, consisting of teeth-cleaning, a rub-down with a wet cloth, drying off, and being slathered in suncream. I had rather a full bladder and, in full pony mode, I just stood there with my legs spread and let it go, not feeling embarrassed or worrying about the mess I was making as it splashed down my thighs and onto the floor - that would be somebody else's problem!<br><br>We were hitched up to the carriage again and driven up to the villa, where we were the centre of attention for those members of staff who hadn't seen us the night before, and they came over to examine the strange phenomenon of these two seemingly normal girls pulling a cart while naked. As they stared at us, I found myself flushing with embarrassment, but secretly I was enjoying it. I wondered whether that was because I was just an exhibitionist, or it was the reinforcement of the ‘otherness’ I felt. Whatever it was, it had a real physical impact, sending my arousal level soaring.<br><br>Maria, the maid, gave us breakfast in the nosebags we had used the night before, and it was the same boring mix of grains and dried fruit, but it was well received by us hungry ponies.<br><br>Eventually, Jorge came out with Conchita and Marianne, and all three mounted the carriage. With a flick of the reins and a click-click of the tongue, we started off down the drive. The gate to the property was open and we were driven out onto the road. We were now out in public, which filled me with fear, excitement, and that strange feeling in my lower belly which meant that my arousal had reached a new peek.<br><br>We went along at a gentle trot, our boots clip-clopping on the paved surface. We passed other properties, where the residents came out to stare at this unique sight and, if they didn't realise we were going by, Jorge would call out to them to make sure they looked! Cars going the other way down the road slowed to a stop as they watched us, and we started to get passers-by running alongside to keep up, calling out and whistling to us. No cars passed us, but I got the distinct impression that this was because they were following on behind in a slow-moving procession, enjoying the view!<br><br>We were turned off the main road, and Jorge brought us to a steady canter until our chasing audience finally gave up. Eventually, we were slowed to a walk and turned into an entrance, which led up to an imposing property. We were steered around the building to the rear, where we were suddenly faced by the polo field.<br><br>We were brought to a halt in front of a small spectator stand, which was completely full, and the crowd all stood up and burst into spontaneous applause as they watched us. A small, officious looking man came down from the seating and walked towards us.<br><br>"Alvares, you old dog!" he exclaimed, spreading his arms and enveloping Jorge in a bear hug when they met, "I don't believe it! Even when I have the best polo ponies in the district, you manage to upstage me!"<br><br>"I'm sorry, mayor," Jorge said, not looking sorry at all, "my daughter gave them to me, and I couldn't resist showing them off. This is Bright Eyes, and this is Scheherazade."<br><br>"Very fine specimens!" the mayor beamed and, to my astonishment, grabbed my breast, giving it a firm squeeze and tweaking the nipple! He stared into my eyes, judging my reaction, then moved on to Scheherazade, presumably giving her the same treatment.<br><br>"Will they be taking part in the game?" he asked, clearly amused by his own remark.<br><br>"I don't think so," Jorge replied, "they're not trained for polo."<br><br>"I can think of a few games I'd like to play with them!" the mayor said, in a rather creepy way.<br><br>"We need to get them into the shade and water them," Conchita's father said, steering the old goat back towards the stands, "do you mind, Conchita?" I felt the reins flap and, rather gratefully, we moved from in front of the stand towards the end of the pitch.<br><br>There was a row of trees, and we were pulled to a halt in their shade. Conchita gave me a drink and a welcome hose-down with icy water, and I'm sure Marianne was doing the same for Scheherazade. Just then, the teams came out onto the pitch, a group of rather dishy-looking men each leading his pony. They all wandered past us, checking us out and, from the leering looks they gave us, I think some of them thought we might be the prize for winning the game!<br><br>I have no idea about polo, and no one was going to explain it to me. It just seemed to be a lot of men charging around on their ponies, swinging a stick and, very occasionally, a ball moved about on the grass. Then it all stopped, the men took the ponies away, and the crowd came out to wander around the pitch, stomping down divots. Quite a lot of them wandered over to us as well, wanting to get a closer look. Luckily, Conchita and Marianne were standing guard beside us, making sure nobody got too close. Then the mayhem started all over again.<br><br>The whole thing seemed to go on for hours, and I had no idea who was winning, or whether it was all one long game or several. I tuned out and, in the sultry afternoon heat, descended into a kind of standing doze, only disturbed when Conchita gave me more water.<br><br>At last, it came to an end. The players disappeared, the crowd dispersed, and Jorge came over to us.<br><br>"Thank you, Marianne and Conchita," he smiled, "for allowing your ponies to come out today. They have made the mayor extremely jealous, which is a definite success in my book! I think we should take them home now, and give them a suitable reward." The carriage was once more fully weighed down with passengers, and we were whipped into action.<br><br>The journey back to the villa was much the same as on the way there - we received plenty of attention and admiring remarks, and we jammed up the small country roads pretty badly as well. When we arrived, we dropped Jorge off at the front door, then were taken around to the side. It was a sweet relief when we were unharnessed and taken into the cool building, Conchita leading me into her room, where she helped me out of my harness, bridal and boots.<br><br>"Before you take a shower," Conchita said to me, "we need to talk."<br><br>"Really? Can't it wait?" I whined, "I really, really need that shower!"<br><br>"It won't take long," she replied firmly, "but it is important." Something in her tone made me stop and pay attention.<br><br>"The thing is, Sarah… What I mean to say is…" she started and then stopped. Suddenly, she looked nervous, indecisive. She looked down at her hands, and then dragged her eyes back up to look at me. She let out a heavy sigh and then took a deep breath. Now she was scarily intense.<br><br>"Sarah Johnson, I want to fuck you so badly!"<br><br>WTF? Where did that come from? Was she serious? I opened my mouth to make some kind of response, perhaps a flippant remark, but nothing would come. Unable to muster a coherent thought, I closed my mouth again.<br><br>"I want you, I’ve wanted you for years," she hurried on, "ever since we got together at school, you've been the brightest, cleverest, prettiest, funniest, most fun person I’ve known. I realised quite early on that I was gay, because of the feelings I had for you."<br><br>"Why…" I tried to process what she had just told me, "why did you never tell me?"<br><br>"I was afraid," she said, biting her lip, "I was afraid that you would reject me, either because I was a girl, or because I was me. It wasn't until I saw you at the stables, and heard about what you got up to with Tanya, that I thought there might be a chance. And then, everything got even more fucking complicated."<br><br>"What you mean, ‘more complicated’?" I asked in confusion, "how could things get more complicated?"<br><br>"I had always wanted you as my girlfriend, my lover," she said simply, "and I do mean love - it's always been about more than just sex. But then, when I saw what you were doing at the stables, when I got to drive you as my pony, I knew that I wanted more. I spent hours in the hotel talking to Marianne about her relationship with Tanya…" She stopped speaking, just looking at me for some reaction. The silence stretched out uncomfortably.<br><br>"I don't understand, Chi," I murmured, "what do you want me – us - to be?"<br><br>"Above all, I want us to stay best friends," she said, holding my hand tenderly, "but my deepest desire is that you become my girlfriend, and my lover. And then it gets complicated!<br><br>"I want you to be my ponygirl - not ‘a’ ponygirl, but mine, Sarah - to be trained to my whip and used as and when I decide. I want you to be my pet, to be pampered and indulged in whatever way I want, and punished if you're bad. I want you to be my fuck bunny, my dressing-up doll, my bondage toy. Sometimes, I want you to simply do what I say, no matter how weird or unfair I may be behaving.<br><br>“I want to be your Domme, the one you call ‘Mistress’ and obey without question. I want to be the one who cares for you and looks after you. The one you trust enough to give all control and submit to unconditionally.<br><br>"I want it all, Sarah. I know it's ridiculous and unfair of me to ask this of you, and to throw it all at you in one go, but that's who I am - impetuous and demanding and, I think, in love with you. Like I said at the start, I want you in all the worst ways there are." She stopped and drew breath, calming herself before continuing.<br><br>"Well, you have it all now," she said, seeming relieved that it was finally out in the open. "I daresay you're shocked, stunned, horrified and deeply offended. If you can still bear to talk to me, please put me out of my misery one way or another. "<br><br>I recognised the irony of the situation. She wanted to order me to do anything, and have me obey without question. Yet she had to ask me whether I was willing to go along with that. I knew it was the same as the whole ponygirl experience – no-one, neither her nor the trainers, could force me to do it if I didn't want to. I had to submit myself to that treatment, and now Conchita was asking me to submit to her, albeit on a more permanent basis.<br><br>I closed my eyes to avoid her piercing stare. I clenched my hands into fists and fought to stop myself retching, as my heart thumped in my chest and blood pounded at my temples. Gradually, I managed to get control of myself, and tried to form the words I wanted to utter.<br><br>"What can I say?" I replied, my voice cracking, "I also learned a lot in the last few weeks. I loved being a ponygirl. I love it when you dress me up, and when you order me about. I realised at the stables just how submissive I am, and that I want - maybe even need - a Mistress. The thought that it might be my best friend is almost too much to hope for. So my response, Conchita, is…<br><br>“Yes, Mistress, yes! I submit! Now, please, fuck me any way you want!"`
