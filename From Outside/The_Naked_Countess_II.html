      { title: "Prologue", summary: "The naked countess begins a new adventure.", content: `It was only a month after Eleonora's last trip to Earth, yet it already began changing Earthian-Sanflarian relations for the better. After the smoke cleared and the treacherous baron was executed for his crimes, Kir'ador found itself on the verge of new opportunities both at home and in the other world. Leo's naked adventure became a popular story in both universes, causing interest in cooperation to grow to unseen heights. It resonated in different social circles, paving a path to new business deals and joint initiatives.<br><br>People told stories about the brave countess, sought interviews with her, and even created artwork based on her voyage to Vegas, building new cultural bridges between nations. The countess enjoyed looking at Sanflarian paintings depicting her in the different reality, sometimes blushing when she saw how much heroism and bravery they put into her stature. She also saw plenty of Earthian artwork through her contact with Arnold. That field was quite different, mainly because it focused more on the fitness of her body than her spirit. Sometimes very directly.<br><br>Still, it was nice to look at the aliens demonstrating appreciation in their own way. Besides, the countess couldn't lie to herself: she loved how hot she looked on those arts, sometimes letting herself a bit of self-admiration. After all, just like enjoying nudity, it was a natural part of being a woman, and Leo was content with it as long as it didn't lead her off the righteous path.<br><br>Lately, however, the countess didn't have much time to herself, as she was preparing for another important mission--the one her parents knew about this time. While Leo's last visit turned out to be a success, it was merely a stepping stone that should've been used to facilitate further contacts for the good of Kir'ador and Sanflaria as a whole. Leo's parents realized this immediately and thus prepared her to be a part of a delegation that will be meeting with several wealthy Earthian investors.<br><br>They were interested in paying for a multi-part documentary about Sanflarian life and customs, which would've become the first joint media project between the nations. Of course, Leo understood that her people couldn't skip over this opportunity to promote their culture and create new contacts, so she got to work. That's why she was on this hill today, surrounded by books and her own notes, accompanied by illustrations made with her painting supplies.<br><br>The gentle sunrays illuminated the pages but could hardly reach the countess herself, as she was protected by the vast, lush forest around her. Its trees were giant, akin to colossuses watching over the little creatures below through their rainbow-colored crowns. The bushes and vines accompanying them stretched all the way down the mountain and to the river running below, overlooking distant villages and stonepeaks. Leo liked this clearing, feeling nature envelop her whole as she sat here in her birthday suit, her golden mane caressed by the wind.<br><br>The rustling of leaves and singing of birds calmed the girl down, while a warm, mossy stone served as a pillow for her bare backside. Occasionally, there'd be a splash of water or a yell coming from below, where naked village gals and their swimsuit-clad boyfriends dove into the chilly river. Other than that, it was quiet. Except for some odd rustling and creaking coming from behind.<br><br>The countess turned around, trying her best not to show irritation. After all, it might've been an animal or a tree getting bent by the gusts of wind. Not finding anyone around her except for a wildcat, Leo turned back to reading. However, it didn't last long, as soon as the countess heard somebody's playful voice calling from above. Before she knew it, she was pinned to the ground with a loud thud, while a pair of strong arms covered her eyes.<br><br>"Guess who!" someone sang in a cheerful voice.<br><br>Before the visitor could get a reply, Leo threw her leg forward and instantly turned around, tossing her to the ground and locking a hold of her own. The blonde was right to prepare for this attack: in front of her was a large, athletic woman in her early twenties. She had broad shoulders, visibly muscular physique, and well-defined, volumptious feminine curves--a blend that made her perfect in both making men turn their heads and, if need be, snapping their necks herself.<br><br>The sight was truly imposing, at least up until one took a look at the girl's face. Then this first impression of a strong, dangerous woman crumbled and shattered. Partially due to the pink hair with childish pigtails, partially due to her silly make-up with excessive eyeliner, but most of all, because of the incredibly naÃ¯ve face of hers with a gaze that could belong to a golden retriever. This mixture of a strong warrior and a cutie straight from a teenager's dreams was an odd sight, but Leo got used to it. She knew this girl as her friend and one of the most fun people to be around, even if she wasn't one of the smartest.<br><br>"Lala, I knew it was you before you even climbed that slope to my left!" the blonde exclaimed while the pink-haired girl struggled in her grasp.<br><br>"But how?!"<br><br>"You've snickered so much coming back that you probably scared off all the wildlife!"<br><br>"Rats! I guess I'll have to do it like in the good-ol' times then."<br><br>Before Leo could react, the pink-haired girl lunged upwards and counterattacked, grabbing the blonde's hand. In a second, she was already twisting Leo's arm while her face was in the dirt, producing muffled swearing. The countess didn't leave it be and drew her leg right into Lala's chest, hitting her boobs like a harsh BDSM master. As Lala gasped, the countess enveloped her long, beautiful legs around the girl's chest and spun them, landing her backside right on Lala's face.<br><br>"Wowie, a new techni..." Lala didn't finish her sentence because her mouth suddenly got blocked by Leo's tight, shaven vulva.<br><br>"Now that will at least make your tongue useful!" the blonde exclaimed victoriously, but only heard new laughs coming from under her privates.<br><br>In the heat of the moment, Leo didn't notice that Lala changed position and threw her leg up to align it with the blonde's face. Then the pink-haired gal made both of them jump with sheer strength and shoved her dirty, bare foot right into her noblewoman's mouth. Leo coughed from this dirty move, but managed to dodge the next strike and locked herself in the struggle with the muscular girl.<br><br>The two tussled and turned, their bodies rubbing against each other and the ground below them, making their skin dirty with mud and grass. Finally, there was an opening for Leo to strike, but suddenly she felt a sweep under her legs and fell down, right into Lala's malicious hugs. The pink-haired girl quickly got behind her, painfully twisting her leg, and did a stern facelock, making Leo's back bend from the pressure.<br><br>"Ouch, ouch! Please, not this move, no, I hurt my back really bad today, please!"<br><br>"Oh?" the excitement quickly evaporated from Lala's eyes; instead, an understanding with a hint of sadness engulfed her entire face. "I'm sorry, I didn't know!"<br><br>As soon as Lala released the hold, the blonde capitalized on it. A couple swift moves was all it took to bring the surprised athlete down in front of Leo, with her ankle right in her hands.<br><br>"And now... the most painful move of all!"<br><br>Lala wondered what this could've meant. Was she going to break her leg for sneaking up on her? Or, maybe, move herself forward and do something sinister with her large, alluring butt? But the reality was worse than all of those assumptions combined: Leo grinned with pure malice and began tickling her friend so hard she couldn't contain her laughter.<br><br>"O-ho-ho! Please, no! Ho-ho-ho! You tricked me! A-ha-ha-ha, no! Okay, okay, I give! I surrender, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!" Lala's voice echoed through the woods, scaring some of the swimmers away from the nearby river.<br><br>In a minute, both women were sitting on the moss-covered stone, naked and dirty, but with huge smiles on their faces. Their joke fights never got old, and each time Leo felt like there was something she could learn. After all, Lala's background in windstriking was even greater than her own.<br><br>"I see manipulation is still your main weakness. Outside of tickling, that is," Leo sighed, sharing her waterskin with the newly arrived friend.<br><br>Lala shrugged with an innocent look in her eyes, unable to stop giggling.<br><br>"Well, at least I made you use it less than five minutes in. Didn't expect you to get so desperate so quickly!"<br><br>The blonde stuck out her tongue, humbled by this witty response.<br><br>"Well, I didn't have time to train more," she finally added, "all this learning has been making my head spin for two weeks now."<br><br>The pink-haired girl looked at the books as she finished drinking, her gaze filled with a mixture of curiosity and sympathy for the blonde. There were stacks of them, arranged on a tablecloth Leo brought from the castle. Lala's eyes wandered across the large tomes and small magazines, pictures, and paragraphs, as well as the countess' notes, which could've probably been made into a book themselves.<br><br>"Interesting. All of that is about the deal?" the pink-haired girl grabbed one of the magazines and began looking at photos of actors and shooting sets.<br><br>Unfortunately, she didn't know enough of English--or any other Earthian language for that matter--to read the words.<br><br>"Yeah. Mom thinks that to truly make sense of what we'll be talking about, I need to grasp how locals approach filmmaking. Such a bore."<br><br>"Aren't they all super obsessed with us being naked? Just shake your tits in front of them and it'll be done!" Lala said, grabbing Eleonora's breasts and moving them from side to side with her firm grip. "Wo-o-o, we're Eleonora's tits, do as we say, wo-o-o!"<br><br>Leo barely contained her laughter and pushed her buddy away, trying her best to not lose her learning mood completely.<br><br>"I told mom the same thing. She said it's not going to be enough; those fat cats probably saw hundreds of tits during their lifetime. Besides, knowledge will let me understand whether they try to deceive us."<br><br>The pink-haired girl agreed mostly since she trusted the countess and didn't question her words.<br><br>"I'm sure you'll talk them into everything you need. Oh, how I wish I could go with you. It's so boring in the castle while you're not around. Others members of your family don't make my serving duties nearly as fun!" Lala humphed like a child who was excluded from a family trip for bad behavior.<br><br>The blonde gave her friend supportive headpats, her eyes full of sympathy.<br><br>"I still don't understand why you wanna go to Earth that much. I already told you how hard it is to breathe in there, how uncultured some of the people are, and how everyone gawks at you like you're an alien... Uh, I meant as if you look like an alien. I mean, I don't mind it personally, it's actually quite charming, but some girls felt the attention to be a bit overbearing."<br><br>"Oh, I remember. But no worries, my lady, I'm fully prepared for spreading our naked lifestyle to any aliens out there, regardless of how many textile barriers we'll have to break on our way!" Lala saluted in her jest but then frowned. "Well, at least I'd be ready if it mattered."<br><br>Indeed, Leo shouldn't have even brought that last point up; this gal was surely not the one to fear attention.<br><br>"Hey, don't you dare to give up! I'm sure my father will let you go somehow. I'll ask him, promise."<br><br>As soon as Leo was about to return to her studies, she heard the sound of a large pair of legs running towards her. A horse-sized white bird with a colorful head and a blunt beak was quickly approaching the clearing, its clawed legs easily jumping over stones and other obstacles. Leo guessed it was a zorrith pretty quickly, but whether it was tamed remained to be seen, as a wild one could've been trouble. Thankfully, both girls quickly noticed a saddle on the zorrith's back and a well-dressed man atop it.<br><br>"Lady Eleonora, your father wishes to see you in the gardens. He says it concerns your future mission," he declared with a respectful bow.<br><br>Leo and Lala looked at each other in surprise. The countess didn't know what to expect from this meeting, but the Liege must've had his reasons, so the duo got up and headed straight to the castle. But only after they descended into the river through the rocky pathway to wash the dirt off themselves, charming the local villagers with their barefoot climbing skills. The road through the woods was quick, leading them back to Leo's dwelling in mere minutes and letting their feet rest a bit when the ground below them turned into smooth pavement.<br><br>It was a large, mighty castle, its skyscraping fire-colored domes towering above the peaks and forests around it. The building looked as if it merged with the nearby rocks and grew right out of it onto the nearby hill. It wasn't that far from truth, as Tyriar's residence was built and expanded through the centuries, starting from a simple cave in which the first Kiradorian settlers hid from the harsh weather and predators.<br><br>They stepped through the courtyard and into the lush gardens, rich with both smells and colors. Gardeners in workwear and female servants clad only in sandals waved and bowed to the countess as she went by, making her repeat "no need to bow" for the 10th time today. Tyriar was waiting in the garden's center, sitting in front of a large fountain with sculptures made from yellow stone. He was in the company of his busty, bejeweled assistant, as well as a man Leo saw for the first time.<br><br>The man was tall and slim, his posture and serious look in his eyes indicating high status, just like his stylish coat adorned with runes. He had short, black hair and wore glasses that only added to his imposing image. As Leo walked up to the trio, she bowed to her father, hugged the assistant, and stretched out her hand to greet this mysterious, handsome stranger.<br><br>"Pleased to meet you," he said in a pleasant tone. "I'm Araman of the Ardor Barony, the head of the delegation that'll travel to the Earthian city of San Francisco for the upcoming negotiations. I'm looking forward to working with you, Lady Eleonora."<br><br>"As do I," the blonde replied while Lala nudged her and gave her a wink, causing her to roll her eyes.<br><br>"We were just going over the organizational aspects of the upcoming mission," Tyriar's mighty voice made everyone fall silent, "I believe that pretty much all pressing issues were resolved. You, my daughter, will be an important part of the upcoming mission. Since you're the only female in the delegation, we decided you'll be carrying the solar eye during your interworld passage."<br><br>Leo's eyes shone with excitement. The privilege of carrying the solar eye--a staff with a shining sphere on its top that represented the Many-eyed's gaze and protection--was usually reserved for the members of the clergy or heroines who proved themselves time and time again. The news were so sudden that Eleonora, respectful to Sanflarian traditions as always, even tried to refuse, saying that this honor might be too much. However, the Liege of Kir'ador clearly made his point that Leo's noble status and her past deeds were more than enough to earn the church's endorsement.<br><br>"Besides, you living strictly in accordance with our dogmas, even refusing to put on clothes when on Earth, also affected their decision," Tyriar smiled as he saw his daughter blush a little.<br><br>However, he became serious again right away, as if remembering something that worried him.<br><br>"There is only one issue left to discuss. Your protection."<br><br>Leo tried to contain herself but still let out a tired sigh. It wasn't the first time she and her father had this discussion, and it became far more frequent after the blonde's latest trip to Nevada. While Tyriar was proud of his daughter, he must've also been terrified when he learned about the times she was on the verge of death. The Liege did not show his concern openly but clearly took note of it and wasn't going to let such situations repeat anymore.<br><br>"But dad... Oh, I mean, but my Liege! I don't need bodyguards. They will just slow me down. Plus, an armored mountain near me would make my exploration much harder... I imagine locals won't be that thrilled to talk with me anymore."<br><br>"My Liege, it's true," Lala rushed to her friend's support. "Just today your daughter showed incredible resilience during our training. Made me taste her pussy in no time at all!"<br><br>The trio looked at the girls with surprise in their eyes, clearly wondering whether it was some odd figure of speech. Leo chuckled a little, finding it both embarassing and funny.<br><br>"Eleonora, you need somebody to protect you, this decision is final," Tyriar concluded, "but, seeing that you showed good understanding of combat situations that might await you on Earth, I can let you choose the guard yourself."<br><br>Lala raised her hand, but Tyriar diplomatically disregarded it.<br><br>"Be careful, however. Your candidate needs to have exceptional physical prowess."<br><br>Lala raised her hand higher.<br><br>"He also needs to be familiar with both Earthian and Sanflarian firearms. Or, if it's a woman, have a background in martial arts such as windstriking."<br><br>Lala began making noises as she waved her arm in the air.<br><br>"Most of all," Tyriar continued, trying his best not to move his gaze to the pink-haired commoner, "it's important for him to understand his mission. Your chosen guard would need to be loyal and ready to sacrifice himself at any moment."<br><br>Lala's hands swayed above her head as she jumped up and down, her large tits and buttcheeks bouncing along to the delight of surrounding men.<br><br>"Hm-m-m," Leo threw a discrete gaze at her friend and rubbed her chin, "I think I'm gonna choose... her."<br><br>"Who?!" Lala suddenly turned around, craning her neck in all directions to find the illusive competitor.<br><br>After two seconds, the countess decided to stop her friend's suffering with an obvious remark:<br><br>"You, silly!"<br><br>The happiness in Lala's eyes was unlike anything the delegation members have seen from her before. She jumped to hug Leo, making her grunt with her tight grip, then turned around and bowed to Tyriar again, thanking for this amazing opportunity. The Liege shook his head, clearly skeptical of his daughter's choice.<br><br>"Well, at least she has enough enthusiasm," Araman whispered to him while the naked girls jumped together while holding their hands.<br><br>"I'd say too much of it," he replied, glancing at Lala's cheerful smile.<br><br>He could only hope she knew what she was agreeing to.<br><br>It took Leo some more talks with her father to convince him that she would be fine. Both knew that it was too late to change anything, as the preparations for the journey were already underway, but the young countess didn't want to leave before making sure they understood each other. On the other hand, the girl's mother--a stunning woman in her forties whose blonde hair almost reached her waist--took the news pretty calmly.<br><br>"Stop worrying, dear," she softly said to Tyriar during a dinner once, "she knows what she's doing. We must trust her, otherwise, she'll never be confident enough to rule Kir'ador herself."<br><br>Leo accidentally overheard this discussion and smiled to herself. This endorsement made her more confident, and she kept spending time with books until the day it was time to depart. Only when the blonde stood on a large platform connected to the portal with Araman, Lala, and other delegates around her did she realize how much she was eager to visit Earth once again and how much pressure this mission would put on her. Failure was not an option. With these thoughts, Leo waved to her parents and subjects as she turned around and held the solar eye high.<br><br>For the next week or two, it was goodbye to Kir'ador and hello to the Earthian city of San Francisco.` },
      { title: "Chapter 2", summary: "The naked countess arrives to her destination.", content: `The Bare Essentials<br><br>Agent Arnold stood in front of the gates and tried his best to suppress his rising anxiety. He attempted the breathing exercises they taught him online, but they didn't seem to be working when competing with the sight of the colossal portal. It looked like it came from a sci-fi movie with its crude metal frame, generators, and control panels around it, as well as the blinking red lights all over its form.<br><br>He's never been to this ICA facility before. Or any other ICA facility besides his office in Nevada, for that matter. While his recent promotion had its perks, it surely added far more responsibilities. The upcoming mission seemed especially important and filled the former clerk with a mixture of stress and happiness. He was glad he'd see Leo again, but he also knew he couldn't screw up anymore. Sanflarians provided security themselves, but Arnold imagined the higher-ups wouldn't be pleased with him if he let something bad happen.<br><br>Arnold's thoughts were cut short when the portal began working, all of its lights turning on simultaneously and connecting into a beam of pure energy that filled the doorway to another reality in seconds. Shadows began appearing on the horizon one by one, and Arnold immediately felt the pressure in his pants as he saw the first one. It was Leo, and she was beautiful. The countess boldly stepped with the shining staff in her hands, holding her head up high and wiggling her hips as if to show off her bare, feminine figure to everyone around her. Whatever deities Sanflarians believed in, Arnold was sure this walk alone was enough for their blessing.<br><br>When the technicians finally lifted their eyes from the naked countess and began doing their job, the agents saw more people emerging from the portal. There was Araman, a stoic expression on his face. Then a couple of armed guards who still gave Arnold the creeps with their bulky armor. The two were closely followed by an additional translator, Araman's assistant, and, much to the agents' surprise, a nice-looking, athletic girl with pink hair and a wide smile on her face.<br><br>The Sanflarians stepped onto the asphalt and greeted the ICA staff. The agents were still trying to collect themselves since the male half was still astounished by Leo's and Lala's naked curves, while the female half humphed and nudged them in annoyance. Arnold, now full of excitement, made his way towards Leo, hoping she didn't forget him after so many weeks. It quickly turned out that she didn't.<br><br>"Hello, my trusted ally," Leo smirked while Arnold politely kissed her hand.<br><br>"Very nice to meet you."<br><br>"Oh, look who's not stuttering anymore. Hey, why are you so focused on my hands? I believe there's something else you'd like to touch more."<br><br>Before Arnold could react, the blonde put her staff behind her back and shook her breasts with an obvious suggestion. The agent asked whether it was appropriate, but Leo assured him they were well within their rights to greet each other how they liked. And she could tell Arnold would like that for sure. With this in mind, the blonde puffed out her chest and felt the agent's hands land on her tits. He groped and rubbed them for a second, making his nearby colleagues red with jealousy.<br><br>Suddenly, Leo hugged Arnold and told him to envelop his arms around her. He did so, enjoying the sensation of the soft, tan skin on her back. Yet the countess urged him to move a bit lower, and he couldn't resist. With awe, Arnold landed his palms right atop Leo's taut buttcheeks and began squeezing them as if giving the girl a massage. He could hear somebody calling him pervert from behind, but at that moment, he didn't care. Everything he wanted was right in front of him.<br><br>"T-thanks, you are very kind," he smiled nervously, realizing that his touching went for a bit too long.<br><br>"No problem. Although it does seem to me like you forgot something," Leo threw another naughty glance and nodded a little.<br><br>It was barely noticeable, but Arnold quickly realized what she meant. She was pointing at her tight, hairless vulva. At this point, the agent wanted to back away, but Leo jokingly reminded him that it'd be disrespectful and that this behavior will have "repercussions." Arnold wished to ask what kind of repercussions she meant, but instead his trembling hand slowly drifted towards Leo's pussy as if on its own.<br><br>Hormones took control of Arnold's body once more, making him forget himself while he stroked and caressed Leo's alluring slit. The girl didn't take a step back and didn't make her suggestion seem like a joke. Instead, she helped him by spreading her legs a little and commending his gentle touch.<br><br>"Wow, you're enthusiastic!" the countess finally smiled, seeing how much the agent enjoyed himself.<br><br>Suddenly Arnold was taken out of this fantasy by a cough. A bulky man with graying hair whom he knew as his captain stood behind him, clearly unamused. Arnold saluted the man and began mumbling something about Sanflarian culture and strange traditions.<br><br>"No worries, officer. It was my idea," Leo interjected. "I simply wanted for my friend to enjoy himself a little so he'd be able to stop thinking about my body and concentrate on more pressing matters. I'd say the first part was a success!"<br><br>Arnold nodded, then flinched as he felt Leo slapping his backside with a playful laugh. The captain grumbled a bit more but went away to discuss more important questions with Araman. Leo and Arnold chatted for a bit, until the agent asked why the blonde didn't introduce him to her naked friend. Leo was visibly surprised as she saw Lala still standing near the portal, waving to the technicians with a smile on her face. A smile that looked frozen, with the corners of Lala's mouth occasionally twitching like she tried to hide a nervous laugh.<br><br>"Must be one of her silly stunts. Lala likes to fool around, she's even more shameless than me in that regard!" Leo said, causing the ICA staff to blush as they imagined what a girl with even less shame could do.<br><br>"Hey, come here, stop pranking the poor locals!" Leo ascended back to the portal and led the pink-haired girl away from the gate by hand while she kept waving.<br><br>Arnold made sure to kiss Lala's hand as well, a little surprised by a blush spreading on her cheeks. Although it could've been an illusion created by her make-up, which she had plenty of. To her credit, it was the only thing the girl was wearing. No shoes, no jewelry, nothing else. She must've been a fan of Leo's style. Even her pigtails were created by tying the hair, not using hairbands. Still, there was a contrast between the two, as Leo didn't even have any make-up or hairdye on, once again making her seem even more naked in comparison.<br><br>"Oh, right, hello!" the girl said and suddenly hugged the agent, his face getting right between her large, enticing breasts.<br><br>At first he was excited. Feeling these large, soft spheres pressing against him was a beautiful sensation. But soon Arnold started feeling something else: Lala's hands. Her grip was so strong the agent could barely breathe, and it was getting worse every second!<br><br>"Stop, silly. You'll traumatize him, and he won't hug a woman again!" Leo half-seriously broke this bearhug, and Lala began to apologize, still keeping that awkward smile on her face.<br><br>"It's okay. At least it mixes pain with pleasure," Arnold said but still took a step back.<br><br>Leo landed her hand on Lala's shoulder and softly caressed her bare skin. She must've noticed the pink-haired girl getting a bit too excited and decided to calm her down. After all, it was Lala's first mission, and it wasn't that hard to believe there was plenty of stress under that cheerful face.<br><br>"Don't be mad at her," the blonde said to Arnold when Lala stepped away to collect herself. "Everyone deals with jet lag differently."<br><br>"Must've been one hell of a jet lag," he laughed it off, rubbing his back.<br><br>The group eventually gathered on the spacious road between the facility's gloomy buildings and headed towards the parking lot, where a car prepared by ICA was already waiting for them. Leo pulled giggling Lala close and did the same with Arnold, now walking arm in arm with both her friends. Before the Sanflarians could even approach the fence, they had to cover their eyes. A blizzard of white sparks engulfed everything in front of them, accompanied by constant talking and camera clicks.<br><br>There were dozens of reporters and journalists. Every media outlet in the US must've sent their people here to try and talk to the arriving aliens. Leo boldly walked into this crowd first, shaking her tits right into their lenses. Lala did the same, although her movements still looked a bit stiff and wooden. The countess laughed at her shyness, thinking that the pink-haired girl must've been very kind and reluctant to stun everyone with her looks.<br><br>"Don't worry, we'll be here for the entire week. They'll have to get used to our naked bodies."<br><br>The blonde then saw a man running right in front of her and getting an impressive closeup of her front side.<br><br>"That's right. And don't you dare hide this beauty with black bars, you hear me?!" Leo shouted with a challenge, to which the photographer nodded with a horny smile.<br><br>Araman and his guards stepped right beside the trio and got bombarded by questions. These ranged from reasonable inquiries about their deal to moronic accusations of sexism and barbaric treatment of women. The delegates made sure to ignore it and quickly walked towards the car while the ICA staff held off the nosy crowd.<br><br>"That must be our car, huh?" Leo asked, raising her eyebrow.<br><br>Indeed, this transport was hard to miss. It was a truck-sized orange electrovan with rounded edges and a row of seats on its roof, protected by a short fence.<br><br>"We, um, tried to replicate Sanflarian vehicles as much as we could. Since you decided to travel on foot to preserve your technologies, ICA wanted to give you as much comfort as possible," Arnold explained to the surprised guests.<br><br>They were not impressed.<br><br>"What a crude mockery of our designs," Leo frowned, but then suddenly gave Arnold a thumbs-up. "I appreciate the thoughtfulness, though."<br><br>The van's door slid open, and the delegation began boarding. Lala, who was suspiciously silent throughout their walk, hurried to get inside, but Leo stopped her.<br><br>"Hey, where are you going?"<br><br>"Um, to the car?" the pink-haired girl replied with innocence in her eyes.<br><br>In response, Leo pointed at the roofless seats above them.<br><br>"You sure it'll be a good idea?" Lala asked with another giggle, "I mean, safety and all."<br><br>"Oh, not you too. I've heard people whining about my safety all the time in Nevada. And guess what? I'm still here. So get your pretty ass on that roof!"<br><br>Lala reacted with a nod and began climbing with a couple of motivational buttslaps from Leo. The countess followed closely after, blessing the entire crew with a bottom-up view on her backside. These seats were far from luxurious, but the girls agreed that the sunlight and the wind on their bare skin more than made up for it. Araman shook his head but decided not to argue with a higher-ranking noble and went inside, signaling that they were ready.<br><br>"San Francisco, here we come!" Leo exclaimed, standing near the fence and holding it with both hands along with Lala.<br><br>The van began moving, finally scaring off the journalists that surrounded it from all sides. Leo and Lala made sure to wave to the photographers and shake their curves at parting. The crowd below nearly stumbled on each other as they tried to get the best pictures, allured by the fit, naked girls standing on the car's roof like statues on an exhibition. Leo didn't have anything against that. She knew that this amazement would be shared by many, many more folks as the naked girls drive through the city like this, their figures free to be ogled and admired by everyone.<br><br>They quickly left the highway behind and turned to the busy streets of San Francisco. The roads were lined with skyscrapers, colorful houses closely packed together, and fancy venues trying their best to attract patrons with ad signs. The contrast to the gray, boring ICA facility was palpable. This city looked vibrant, alive with people and businesses alike, its crowded roads leading them around like veins carry a person's lifeblood.<br><br>Lala held onto the railing and braced herself for the van's speed. Leo did the opposite, turning on the music from an inbuilt radio and enjoying the moment.<br><br>"Come on, breathe it in! Not literally though. The air here is very dirty!" the blonde nudged her friend and began dancing to a Sanflarian song blasting through the speakers.<br><br>Her hips hypnotically swayed to the rhythm while her breasts jumped up and down, as if supporting their owner. The passersby pointed and turned their heads, the drivers honked in unison with the loud music, and people opened their windows with their phones to take a picture. All attention was on the naked girls, who waved to the crowds below them like they were on a parade. Lala got all giggly from being the center of attention while Leo kept showing off her moves, bending her back and raising her legs despite the van's speed.<br><br>"I... I'm not sure it's safe, my lady," the pink-haired girl said carefully.<br><br>"Oh, don't be boring. What's with you today? We'll have enough time to be serious later. Now we need to demonstrate a fun side of Sanflaria, one that everyone here will remember!"<br><br>With these words, the blonde let go of the railing and fully gave herself to the dance. She was spinning and whirling across the roof like a dervish, consumed by the rhythm and the crowd's aroused comments. She got plenty of reactions, especially when the van slowed down or stopped at a traffic light. Some looked with joy, some with surprise, others with scorn, but one thing was clear: Sanflarian culture will surely get more popular after today.<br><br>"Come on, lighten up a little!" the countess said, seeing that Lala was only slightly wiggling her hips, the rest of her figure unmoving.<br><br>Before the pink-haired girl could protest, Leo suddenly lunged at her and attacked with her most powerful move: tickles. Lala's smile turned into a crazed fit of laughter, and her entire body began twitching from the blonde's pressure. The athlete tried to keep her hands on the railing at first, but gave up and tried her best to fight back against this torture. The two began sexily wrestling atop the van, cheered on by the horny onlookers.<br><br>The blonde kept jumping and ducking, constantly sticking her palms under Lala's armpits or near her ribs. The pink-haired girl dashed forward, aiming to finally end her suffering, but her bare leg got caught in-between the railings, which gave Leo even more room. Gasping, the bodyguard swayed around and somehow fended off her enemy. The two traded half-serious attacks, and this time, Leo was the loser: having lunged at Lala too fast, she lost her footing and got her upper body stuck in-between the railings, including her impressive chest.<br><br>"I think I'll have to teach you some manners, m'lady!" the bodyguard bowed with mockery and raised her hand up high.<br><br>Knowing Leo wasn't afraid of tickles, Lala came up with another way to punish her. As soon as the blonde tried to move, Lala's palm hit her backside and bounced away from its taut muscles. The pink-haired girl lowered her hand again, then again, and again, smacking Leo's butt like it was pain tolerance training. The countess struggled and swore, causing the van driver to poke his head out of the window to check whether everything was okay.<br><br>"Oh, we're alright, just showing locals our Sanflarian traditions... A-a-a-a-h you bitch!"<br><br>Realizing that she couldn't go backwards, Leo did the only logical thing and launched herself forward instead.<br><br>"My lady, wait!" Lala called out, but it was too late.<br><br>The blonde disappeared behind the van's wall, causing the blushing and terrified bodyguard to lean over the railing and look for her friend. Thankfully, Leo jumped back onto the roof right beside her, having pulled herself up by the fence while giving the passengers a surprising glance at her nude body. She quickly got Lala with a foot sweep, but instead of using a hold, she opted for a warm hug instead.<br><br>"Ha, I win again. No manipulations this time!"<br><br>"Still not fair, I demand a rematch!" Lala giggled, cuddling up to her lady when they both landed into one of the seats.<br><br>"You'll get it soon, no worries. Had a bit of fun?"<br><br>"Yes, but, um, could you not scare me like this anymore? It was very stressful, seeing you jump off," Lala had this awkward giggling fit again, still worried.<br><br>"Don't worry, I'd never do that if I weren't confident I'd make that trick work. Why are you looking at me like that? Listen, I get it. You're a bodyguard, and you're treating this role seriously. But it doesn't mean you cannot keep being my silly bestie as well!"<br><br>"Yeah. True, true," Lala replied somewhat unconfidently, making it seem like there was a different reason for her nervousness.<br><br>The blonde didn't pry. She simply didn't have time since the van reached their hotel. Araman went inside while Arnold waited for the nude girls to come down, either being a gentleman or simply wanting to get that bottom-up view once more. The delegation couldn't be thankful enough that Earthians didn't leak which hotel they were staying in, so there was no press around. Just a handful of stunned guests and passersby, most of whom weren't even sure whether it was a Sanflarian visit or a bizarre ad campaign.<br><br>The hotel made a good first impression. Even if its luxurious suites were no match for Sanflarian chambers, they was still a welcome end to this tiresome road. The staff was quite polite, obviously having been warned about whom they'll be meeting today. The young man at the reception escorted the delegates to their room with a wide smile on his face, trying not to ogle Leo's and Lala's naked curves. The blonde still caught him glancing once, but it was a good try.<br><br>But the best part was meeting their personal cleaning crew. It consisted of two beautiful, petite girls in their early twenties. One was a short-haired blonde, the other had long, brown hair. When Arnold saw the two in the corridor for the first time, he froze and nearly turned around on pure reflex. He was impressed by the youtful spark in their eyes, by the careless smiles on their faces, and, most of all, by the fact that both of them were completely naked.<br><br>"H-hello," the agent said with a nod, unsure of what to make of them.<br><br>"Oh, aren't you two just adorable? Good job, that's the best kind of uniform a woman can wear anytime!" Leo locked her palms together, savoring their company.<br><br>The cleaners giggled as they passed the group by, carrying their supplies to the closet.<br><br>"We knew you'd like it, Lady Eleonora," one of them said in a cute tone. "We were hired especially for cleaning your rooms, our dear guests. The management said we had to... adjust our uniforms so you all could be nice and comfortable in our company, he-he."<br><br>"Tell them we're happy with their choice," the blonde smacked their naked butts and positively reacted to how taut they were. The cleaners let out a chuckle and disappeared behind the corner, continuing to do their duties with playful vigor.<br><br>"We see you've prepared well," Araman said to Arnold, "it's a good sign for your agency. After all, those who want respect must give it first."<br><br>The agent told him the US always respected Sanflarian laws and culture, making it seem like he knew what he was talking about. In reality, the nude cleaning crew was entirely the hotel's idea. Still, it was nice to see that they had ICA's back.<br><br>After some formal discussion, the delegation spread to their rooms, preparing for a lunch in a nearby restaurant. Araman planned to run his points a couple more times before the upcoming meeting tomorrow, and the girls would have another chance to see more of Earthian culture. And show off their own along with their bodies.<br><br>Leo bolted into her room and jumped into the king-sized bed, enjoying the softness of its white sheets. It's like the owners made those especially for the delegation so that naked girls could enjoy their rest to the fullest. She removed the blankets first thing though, as Sanflarian females weren't allowed to cover their bodies even while sleeping. Lala walked closely behind her lady but soon went to the bathroom, saying she had to take a shower after that dusty street.<br><br>"Sure, you want to go together so we could rub each other's backs?" Leo winked with suggestion.<br><br>"Um, I think I need a moment on my own, m'lady, be right back!" the pink-haired girl giggled and disappeared behind the door, locking it right away.<br><br>The blonde simply shrugged and went to talk with the rest of her crew, catching the flirtatious gazes of the muscular Sanflarian soldiers from another room.<br><br>She was sure Lala would come to her senses soon, even if it was a bit weird to see her act so strangely all of a sudden.` },
      { title: "Chapter 3", summary: "", content: `A Meal and a Show<br><br>Lala stood in front of the large bathroom mirror, trying to catch her breath. The girl's hands were shaking, her cheeks felt like they were burning, and she couldn't shake off that nervous laughter. It hit her as soon as she crossed the interplanar portal and stood on that platform, surrounded by ICA agents and technicians. They were of different genders, ages, and nations, but had one thing in common: their eyes.<br><br>Those hungry, gawking, sometimes surprised, or even scornful eyes that stared at Lala's bare flesh like nobody stared at her before. That's when the pink-haired girl felt her muscles become stiff and could only wave like an idiot before Eleonora came to her rescue. She took it for a simple surprise at first, but during the ride everything got even worse.<br><br>Lala stood upright and examined her nude form in the mirror. The girl's shapely, somewhat bulky body of an athlete seemed different somehow. Her round breasts were still there, her vulva was as tight and hairless as always, and her slightly visible abs remained on her belly. Yet she felt a weird sense of discomfort seeping through her image. She was scared. No, that's not the right word. Ashamed? Closer, but still not it.<br><br>She was embarrassed.<br><br>"Guide me, Many-eyed," Lala said as she began washing her face with cold water, hoping it'd calm her down.<br><br>It was hard for the girl to understand, as she's never had this emotion before. Nakedness was her natural state, clothing had never touched that body since birth. And yet, somehow, on Earth it started to feel different. Lala knew it wasn't the norm here, and she didn't think that'd be a problem. Yet as soon as this flurry of stares hit her, she felt the ground slipping from under her feet.<br><br>She never received that kind of attention before, and it was just too much for an emotional, impressionable girl like her. Leo must've been bolder than she imagined. Lala tried to collect herself after a freezing shower but felt only a desire to barricade herself in this room and never leave again. However, it wasn't meant to be, and a familiar voice ringing out in the hallway reminded her of that.<br><br>"Hello, where is my bodyguard? I'm about to enter a dangerous gastronomic environment. I need assistance to defeat all of the food in their buffet," Leo said like a warchief.<br><br>"I'm... I'm coming. Give me a minute!" Lala's voice trembled when she imagined herself in the middle of a buffet with everyone staring at her.<br><br>"I told you not to eat carafruit with undergreens prior to our trip, didn't I?" the blonde made Lala cringe a little with her joke.<br><br>The pink-haired girl said she had to fix her make-up and that she'd be right up. Leo replied ironically again, saying that she understands since Lala must feel naked without her eyeliner.<br><br>"As you wish. But I got two hunky soldiers here and one cute boy with black hair, so it's in your best interest not to miss our lunch!" the countess finally walked away from the door while Arnold complained about being called "boy" in the background.<br><br>Lala got some of her hot-pink eyeliner on, then some more, then another bit. It continued until she realized there was no room for more make-up, and it was time to face her fear. She couldn't tell Eleonora. How would her lady react if she realized that her closest friend had such sinful, heinous feelings like shame over her own nudity?<br><br>No, Leo and her family trusted her with this mission, and she had to follow through. With these thoughts, Lala forced herself to leave the bathroom, still blushing and giggling like a nerd on a first date. The CMNF group walked to the elevator while Lala tried to focus her mind or something else and put her hands around her large, alluring tits to make them at least a little less jiggly.<br><br>The buffet tables groaned under the lines of different dishes, each more tempting than the last. Cooking sounds and pleasant aromas filled the air, making the delegation's mouths water. The warmth from the kitchen pleasantly caressed the girls' naked bodies while making clothed delegates sweat a little. Lala felt her stomach rumble in anticipation and could finally concentrate on something other than her nudity.<br><br>But only for a moment, as she quickly saw more than two dozen people at the tables, with most of them staring at her and Leo's bouncing breasts and butts like they were the tastiest meals this place could offer. Lala got so nervous she even dropped the tray, attracting even more attention. She quickly got it back and jested with "silly me" before approaching the food rows.<br><br>She had to get creative while talking to others and choosing her food, covering herself with a tray as if on accident. First, she placed it over her backside to block the view for the male patrons, who seemed hungry in more ways than one. Then she had to move it to her front because the cooks kept staring at her titties, some even forgetting to look after their food! Despite Lala's best efforts, she began blushing again, and her speech turned to mumbling. Well, at least it won't be noticeable when she'll be munching on those scallops.<br><br>Leo was completely fine, just as expected. She slapped a guy's butt after hearing him say that "he'd choose this blonde's buns over any other bread they offer" and even made a couple of cracks herself, happy to accept the role of a shameless nudist they saw her as. After loading up their plates with enough food to rival the soldiers', the athletic girls walked to the table, where Lala could finally relax a little thanks to the tablecloth concealing part of her naked form.<br><br>"Hey," Eleonora pointed at Lala's legs before they began eating, "don't be so unwelcoming to our spectators."<br><br>Lala looked down and realized she sat cross-legged with her back hunched over, as if trying to hide behind the other delegates. Meanwhile, Leo confidently spread her legs and puffed out her chest, provoking the horny onlookers further. When the blonde jokingly urged Lala to do the same, she agreed despite the trembling in her limbs nearly making her drop her plate.<br><br>"Y-you alright?" Arnold asked with concern.<br><br>"Yeah, absolutely, totally!" Lala replied with the help of the translator, "just hungry."<br><br>With this, she stuffed her mouth full of food and started eating like a savage, hopeful that the taste would draw the shame out of her mind.<br><br>"So, Lady Eleonora, I trust you remember our talking points?" Araman took the stage, calm and serious.<br><br>Leo nodded, her gaze suddenly changing. Both Lala and Arnold were surprised to see that silly, playful nudie suddenly turn into a cold-hearted diplomat when she started going over the upcoming deal with Araman. They talked in Sanflarian, so nobody, even Arnold, could eavesdrop. He could only hear Araman's serious tone shift from time to time and Leo making active gestures with her fork while her boobs jiggled along.<br><br>They had lot to discuss, with both Leo and the baron having strong views that didn't always coincide. For example, the documentary's genre, as the baron wanted to focus on his country's history and technological advancements more than anything to demonstrate their achievements. Leo, on the other hand, would like a broader view of their culture as a whole. Including a part dedicated to religious and social norms associated with female nudity, which she anticipated to be the most popular topic among Earthians.<br><br>However, the first thing they decided to do was to act as a united front, whatever disagreements they may have. Being united while remaining different was a principle that all Sanflarians were familiar with. Even still, there were a number of difficulties they could expect.<br><br>They ranged from the degree of the Americans' creative involvement and the project's budget to more abstract issues like the nudity taboo in most countries. It seemed like the promotion of this documentary would turn into a whole separate topic where they'll have to fight against Earthian barbaric censorship. There was an idea of blurring the women's privates for the cinema feature, but Leo didn't even want to hear it.<br><br>"I've seen their shameful black bars and pixels hiding what should've been free for anyone to land their gazes on," she scoffed at the thought, "we are not making a unique project about Sanflaria with our own perspective to just repeat what their researchers were doing all this time."<br><br>"That's right! Nudity, heck yeah!" Lala agreed haphazardly.<br><br>Others glanced at the pink-haired girl in surprise, causing her even more discomfort, but soon continued the discussion after Leo gave her bodyguard a shoulderpat and thanked her for her sincere, enthusiastic support. Lala gave a couple more hectic endorsements like this, every one of which only caused her embarrassment to rise. Soon, she realized she just couldn't take it anymore. She could barely hold the dessert spoon due to all the shaking and shivers traveling across her body.<br><br>The fear soon took over and made Lala do something drastic: she grabbed the ice-cream cup and held it over her chest for a moment, then jerked her hand sideways and "accidentally" spilled all of the vanilla-chocolate flavor mix right onto her breasts and belly, shivering from the sudden coldness.<br><br>"Oh no, I'm so clumsy today," she said dramatically, "I'll go clean myself up to the bathroom, be right back!"<br><br>However, right when she got up from her seat, she felt a strong yet soft grip on her shoulder.<br><br>"Why is that?" Leo sat her friend back down, her lips curled in a mischevious smile. "I think we both know there is a better way to clean up, don't we?"<br><br>Sparks of energy were dashing in the countess' eyes, and it seemed like she thought Lala was in on her idea as well. Leo must've spotted that her movement was fake but completely misunderstood its purpose! Before Lala could react and explain the situation, Leo had already bent down and neared her breasts.<br><br>"My bodyguard is under attack by this cold liquid. I have to save her from hypothermia quickly!" Leo exclaimed while Arnold and even the Sanflarian soldiers blushed, realizing what she was about to do.<br><br>The blonde began by sticking out her tongue and licking some ice cream off Lala's chin, admiring its taste with soft moaning. Then she lowered her head and started tasting the dessert right from her friend's tits, carefully but quickly caressing their soft forms. Lala continued giggling, her hands shaking even more as she saw the shocked patrons around them. Some of them cheered the naked girls on, others took photos, an older couple even left, unable to take this indecency.<br><br>Leo's wet tongue traveled across her friend's impressive chest with no restrictions, soon ending up on her nipples, which she kept playfully sucking and biting with a naughty smile on her lips. Lala let out a moan as well, but clearly not because of the ice cream. She'd like to think her nipples got hard and her pussy started tingling due to the coldness, but deep inside she knew it was only one of the reasons.<br><br>Arnold ended going to the bathroom himself since he simply couldn't take this sexual pressure anymore. Soldiers and the translator stared at Leo in awe, making cracks to each other about her carefree nature. While seeing naked girls was ordinary for them, something like this was still quite a sight. Araman, on the other hand, advised Leo to be more serious and returned to his studies, unbothered by the sexual show in front of him.<br><br>Lala's meek protests did nothing to stop her countess, who soon slid her tongue all over the bodyguard's breasts and turned her attention to her belly, playfully kissing each of the abs. When the pink-haired girl managed to utter her first coherent sentence, Leo was already sticking her tongue inside of her belly button, sucking all of the vanilla-chocolate goodness out of it like a hungry predator.<br><br>"M'lady, everyone's watching... and filming... and..." Lala said, her mind messy with all kinds of pleasant and stressful thoughts fighting each other.<br><br>"Stay still," Leo gently slapped the girl's hip. "Otherwise, the ice cream will spill further. We don't want that, do we? He-he."<br><br>"A-as you say, Lady Eleonora," Lala whispered obediently, barely able to make a sound.<br><br>Lala's eyes dashed from side to side, scanning each look aimed at her naked, dirty figure. She felt like a spy trying her best not to break character under interrogation that got more intense with each catcall and camera click. Her legs urged her to run away, her hands held the table so hard that its cloth nearby ripped, but Lala held her ground, feeling her ass pressing against the chair.<br><br>"M-m-m," Leo kept licking while also glancing at the people recording her and winking at their pervy gazes.<br><br>Finally, Lala's body was completely clean. At least save for her pussy, which was now covered by several streams of chocolate. Leo bit her lip in anticipation and put her hand right on her friend's vulva. Another moan escaped Lala's mouth, and her vision became hazy, but she didn't dare to speak against her mistress' will. The playful fingers slowly traveled upwards, collecting the chocolate on their way, then let go and neared Leo's mouth.<br><br>"Very good ice cream! Too bad you didn't have a chance to have more," she said, putting the chocolate-covered fingers in her mouth and licking them clean.<br><br>"N-no big deal," Lala giggled again, but louder, "it's unhealthy for my diet anyway!"<br><br>"I think you've been a very good bodyguard so far and deserve a treat. How about you try some of mine?" Leo held up her own cup and playfully balanced it on top of her tits, ready to cover herself with the cold, sticky dessert.<br><br>But this time Lala was faster. Her leg moved as if on a reflex, fueled by the adrenaline of her blinding shame. It took one precise hit to break the chair's leg, and in the very next second, Lala was already flying to the floor while Leo looked at her in surprise, thinking that the seat just broke on its own. Arnold came back just in time to help Lala up and proposed she come back to their room, to which the girl agreed. Meanwhile, Leo got up and started demanding that the craftsman who made this furniture be brought before her to face trial. It took Araman and the rest of the delegation to calm the furious amazon down.<br><br>Lala left the buffet feeling very conflicted: she hated to trick her best friend like that, but at least now she could get a breather.<br><br>***<br><br>Unfortunately for Lala, she couldn't fake a trauma well enough, and the rest of her day was not much better. At sunset, the naked girls went on a stroll around the hotel's territory with a small crowd of horny onlookers following them around. Then, Leo--as always--got bolder and decided to walk onto the shiny streets of the city itself, where Lala had to accompany her all the time.<br><br>The blonde gracefully stepped on the sidewalk under the rays of the setting sun, waving and smiling to passersby with noble pride. Lala scuttled beside her, not knowing what to do with her arms as well as her round, feminine shapes that treacherously attracted gazes from every direction. She wasn't enjoying this in the slightest, but Leo didn't seem to notice, instead taking her hand and daring her to walk farther and farther from the hotel to see all of the interesting buildings, murals, and billboards.<br><br>The worst part was taking photos for, and with, the lusty men who thought they could do everything if they saw a girl walking naked. Leo didn't protest against their hands on her butt, vulgar comments, or requests to take a suggestive pose. To her, these were compliments from the people who, while uncultured, served as living proof that it was necessary for women to go naked around them and thus supported her philosophy. She even let one especially bold guy fondle her tits for half a minute, feeling sympathy for him being deprived of the female nudity in his daily life.<br><br>Lala didn't object to her friend's radical nudism, but every touch and comment still felt like a jolt of electricity running through her body. She accidentally gave one guy an elbow when he touched her too quickly, then had to apologize and let him grope her ass so he wouldn't try suing her for battery. One of the most humiliating moments of Lala's life, and she dreaded to think what could come next! At least Leo quickly jumped to her friend's defense and commended her quick reaction.<br><br>Lala only felt calm after their walk when the delegation came back to their suites. Before going to sleep, Leo decided to have a nice, warm bath and invited Lala to share it with her. It was nice lying together with her lady, their bodies rubbing and pressing against each other in the soapy water. It was also important to rid their bodies of all the dust and dirt, especially their bare feet that turned black from walking the city roads.<br><br>"You're quite tense today. No worries, I understand. First day of work, first day in another world... It happens," the blonde said as she began massaging Lala's shoulders just the way she liked it.<br><br>The bodyguard could feel the stress and anxiety leaving her body at once but still couldn't make herself tell the truth. Leo was so sure of Lala's shamelessness that she couldn't even consider her being embarrassed, despite seeing her blushes and trembling throughout the day. How would she react if she learned about it? Lala decided to start cautiously.<br><br>"My lady..."<br><br>"Come on, we are not in public right now. Just Leo."<br><br>"Leo, you know, I chatted with some friends before we left. They said visiting Earth would be s-o-o cool and unusual! Honestly, I agree, but some girls also felt a little... Scared, maybe?"<br><br>"Scared? Of what?"<br><br>"Well... of the locals making such a fuss about nudity. They said that, like, they feel fine on Sanflaria, but when everyone sees it as something shameful, they could get scared and even try to cover their bits. It was none of our friends, no-no, but still, interesting idea, right? What, um, would you think about such a girl?"<br><br>The blonde shook her head, and her grip became tighter for a moment.<br><br>"I'm unsure, Lala. It sounds very odd to me. Especially the part about covering their bodies. I'm used to seeing this reaction in the local females. Poor things strive for nudity with their miniskirts and tank tops but don't have enough courage to go all the way, chained by the outdated laws of this society... But from one of our own? I'd suspect some problems."<br><br>"Oh, Leo, you won't believe it, but I said the same! But, um, what kind of problems?"<br><br>"Maybe she's too unsure of herself and needs further guidance. Maybe there's some weakness in her character that needs to be addressed before she steps foot on Earth. Or she's just disrespectful to our traditions and views the foreigners' view as more valuable than ours! Either way, I don't think I would've taken such a troubled girl on my mission. I wouldn't trust her to spread our message."<br><br>Lala felt her heart sinking deeper and deeper with each word her lady spoke. The water was still warm, but she couldn't stop shivering. Of course, there was nothing surprising about that response. Lala knew about Leo's patriotic views since they were children; this talk just served as a confirmation.<br><br>"I can feel your disappointment, you know."<br><br>These words made Lala freeze in fear of the next phrase Leo might say. However, the blonde simply laughed and hugged her from behind, barraging her neck and cheeks with kisses.<br><br>"My emphathetic friend, don't fret. I'm certain the girls you talk about will find their way eventually. We'll lead them by example, showing off our bodies even more to pave the road forward! How's that sound?"<br><br>"Wowie, what a great idea!" Lala threw her hands into the air.<br><br>For the first time in her life, she regretted being unable to drown in a bathtub.<br><br>At least the night finally brought Lala her long-awaited peace as the two cuddled and began dozing off in each other's arms. The countess looked calm and confident as she fell asleep with her cheek pressed to Lala's breast, and, for once, the pink-haired girl allowed this feeling to overtake her as well. It seemed as if everything would be alright in the end, and all of her issues were already becoming a distant memory...<br><br>"Rise and shine, sexy! The time for our mission has come!" Leo's voice rang out above Lala's head through the noise of running water.<br><br>The bodyguard opened her eyes in an instant, forcing a smile in front of the busty blonde standing above her. The calmness she felt before was just tiredness taking over her senses. Now it was gone, leaving Lala with a realization that she will once again have to parade her nudity in front of the entire city with no way to hide, flee, or even express her emotions. This was shaping up to be a long day.` },
      { title: "Chapter 4", summary: "The naked countess escalates her exposure.", content: `Nude in San Francisco<br><br>Both ICA staff and Sanflarian guards were on edge from the moment the sun rose on the horizon. The entire route of the delegation was scanned for threats, every possible problem was accounted for, and various scenarios were modulated to make sure everyone was ready. The meeting was going to start in several hours. Arnold felt the pressure like never before as he escorted the naked girls to their transport. Thankfully, his joy from seeing Leo's and Lala's naked butts wiggling in front of him made up for all the negatives, but it also meant he had to concentrate on his tasks extra hard.<br><br>Several camera flashes and clicks followed the girls as they walked onto the street, making Leo stick out her tongue and bend over for a sexy pose. Arnold had to give it to the local press: they were very good at sniffing out confidential info. This time, Sanflarians didn't have time for pleasantries and disappeared in their orange van shorly after the paparazzis started bothering them. Thankfully, Araman managed to talk Leo into riding inside today, as he wanted to review their negotiation tactics before the meeting. The documentary series had to be made exactly the way Sanflaria wanted; neither of the delegates would accept another option.<br><br>"Don't worry, baron, I'm sure my appearance will make them want to make concessions before we even demand them!" the blonde joked in her seat, spreading her legs in defiance of Earthian modesty rules just like always.<br><br>"I'm afraid that this will not be enough, Lady Eleonora. The first impression will only get us so far."<br><br>Leo nodded and landed her hand on Araman's shoulder in support.<br><br>"My dear baron, I know this. My mind is as sound and ready as my body is. I hope you didn't pick up a habit of disregarding the inner beauty of naked women from some of the locals."<br><br>The two shared a laugh, a welcomed moment of levity in this stressful day. Lala shared their mood as well but quickly turned to the window with her legs close together and her breathing heavy. Arnold noticed but couldn't ask about it due to the language barrier. Whatever it was that made Lala so restless, he was sure Leo would take care of it.<br><br>The van rode steady but surely. Buildings and streets flew by behind its windows, giving the delegation a glimpse into the vibrant and lively atmosphere of the city. Soon, regular houses became increasingly rare, giving way to skyscrapers and spacious office buildings. They were headed to San Francisco's financial district--a boiling pot of commerce and business ideas.<br><br>The meeting was set to happen at the Transamerica Pyramid, which was visible even from here, towering above the entire district like a parent watching over its little children. It looked like they were going to reach it quite soon, with no delays or obstacles along the way. However, then came a traffic light that immediately changed these plans.<br><br>When the vehicle stopped, the translator looked into one of the windows and suddenly got very curious. He said something in Sanflarian and pointed to the side, where a wide pedestrian street connected to the main road. Leo and Araman both looked up from their papers, a cheerful laugh quickly escaped the countess' mouth.<br><br>"Wow, what a confident girl! I wonder if she's a local or one of ours," the blonde said with admiration.<br><br>When Arnold finally managed to reach the window, he saw a picture that made him fall silent for a second, just like when he saw Leo for the first time. It was a tall, slim woman with long, blonde hair and a very dark tan without any lines. The lack of lines was clear because the woman was completely naked, save for a necklace and a pair of black sneakers. Her round face with well-defined cheekbones had a naughty grin on it, despite the seemingly problematic situation.<br><br>She stood in the middle of the street with a short but very energetic young man who held a professional camera and tried his best to explain something to the policeman nearby. It seemed like the officer stopped this couple of daredevils while they were shooting a nude-in-public set and probably tried to charge them with public indecency. Well, the woman at least. Despite this, the surrounding locals seemed to consider her behavior completely decent, catcalling the model and snapping photos.<br><br>"We have to help her!" Leo concluded to the surprise of everyone in the van.<br><br>"My lady, I understand your concerns, but we cannot stray from our course," Araman tapped on the papers.<br><br>"Leave your worries, baron. We have more than two hours before our meeting, and the road will only take twenty minutes tops," she parried. "This woman is risking her social standing to challenge unfair and barbaric customs that make her cover her beauty. I will not leave her to be persecuted for her will to be free!"<br><br>"Um, Leo, I don't think this is that serious," Arnold said, but quickly shut up once the countess threw a stern look at him.<br><br>Araman sighed. He recognized that voice and that attitude because he'd seen it in the past. It was clear that Eleonora wouldn't be stopped by his or anyone else's appeals to reason. So he agreed, but noted that his lady had to remain under protection if she was to walk out in public. Arnold volunteered to escort her to the streets, and Leo herself called Lala to assist her in this important moment. Everyone was focused on the blonde, so they didn't see Lala's expression turn to horror and her body shake when she glanced at the crowds of people around them.<br><br>Before they could even finish their discussion, Leo jumped out and led her blushing friend to the sidewalk, letting both the breeze and the public's reactions hit them like a wave. Arnold followed closely behind, hopeful that today Leo will act more rationally than she did in Vegas. Well, at least the hope dies last.<br><br>"Wow! There are more!" a guy with his phone in his hands pointed at the naked girls.<br><br>The people immediately turned their attention to the Sanflarians, their laughs and woos echoing throughout the street. Leo didn't seem to notice, too focused on her goal. While she kept gracefully striding towards the nude model, Lala kept waving and giggling anxiously. People waved back, probably thinking she was enjoying this to the fullest. Oh, if only they knew about the chaos that took over her mind as soon as she left the safety of the van. Still, Lala chose duty over shame and walked beside her lady, taking care not to trip on her weak legs.<br><br>"Hello, officer. What seems to be the problem?" Leo said as she walked to the policeman and landed her hands on her hips.<br><br>The man looked over her in surprise. He looked a bit lost, not ready for the majestic countess to pressure him with both her attitude and her raw sexuality at the same time. Meanwhile, the model and her photographer looked elated: the naked girl couldn't contain herself and applauded to her nude saviors while the guy silently raised his camera and began snapping pics like a hardened journalist.<br><br>"Um, ma'am, I suggest you cover yourself. We all know that San Francisco is a nudist-friendly city, but there are limits to everything," the policeman finally replied.<br><br>It was a big mistake on his part, and he realized it as soon as he saw the raging sparks in the blonde's eyes.<br><br>"Cover myself? How dare you suggest I rob the world of the sight of my beautiful body?" she stood right in front of the officer and pointed at his chest.<br><br>The people around the scene giggled and whispered to each other; nobody expected to see this kind of show when they left homes today. Seeing that situation was getting out of control, Arnold rushed to Leo's--or officer's--rescue and began frantically going over ICA's official talking points. The policeman nodded upon seeing his badge and slowly backed away, realizing that the law wasn't on his side today.<br><br>"As you know," Arnold said after taking a deep breath, "Sanflarian women are allowed to be naked in public wherever and whenever they desire, and we're not allowed to stop them."<br><br>"That's right!" the countess glared at the defeated man.<br><br>The officer looked at Leo and Lala, then back at the nude model, who kept clapping like she just listened to her favorite singer. The naked women could see gears turning in his head as he refused to go down without a fight.<br><br>"Yes, but you see, this woman is not Sanflarian!" the policeman finally said, pointing at the model.<br><br>The tanned girl pouted and shook her head. Finally, her photographer spoke, his voice pretty high-pitched for a man, but very confident nonetheless:<br><br>"We understand your concerns, officer. But my friend Cynthia simply wanted to showcase our appreciation for Sanflarian culture and meet Eleonora the way she'd be comfortable with."<br><br>Cynthia started nodding, her rosy lips still curled up in a grin. The policeman wasn't buying it, but then Leo took matters into her own hands.<br><br>"Officer, I'm a diplomat from a different world on an official mission," she claimed, "this woman here is with me, and I'm the one who's responsible for her stripping naked today. Therefore, if you want to charge her, you have to charge me as an accomplice. Otherwise, you have to let us go and return to our mission. You wouldn't want to be the reason for an important negotiation to fail, would you?"<br><br>The officer frowned, his hands shaking a little from anger. He clearly didn't appreciate this butt-naked girl suddenly coming in and preventing him from doing his job. Still, the stakes were a bit much for a public indecency fine, so he gave it to the Sanflarians and left with the coldest "have a good day" Arnold has ever heard.<br><br>Cynthia and her photographer finally breathed a sigh of relief. Before Leo could say anything, the model suddenly jumped on her with a warm, passionate hug. Leo and Lala returned it with equal enthusiasm, the latter happy to find at least some way to cover her front for a moment.<br><br>"Appreciate the help," Cynthia said with a sly look, "the fine wouldn't hurt me that much since I'd earn more by posting these pics on OnlyFans anyway, but it'd be a shame to stop our shooting."<br><br>"It's nothing. Anyone can see that clothes are completely redundant for a beauty like you. If you ask me, I think you should just throw away your garments and go naked full-time!"<br><br>The model giggled at the suggestion but wasn't quick to accept it. Suddenly, their talk was interrupted by a camera click.<br><br>"Wow, now that's some quality NIP!" the photographer said with the eyes of a maniac.<br><br>"Hey, don't you know that it's rude to take nude pics of a girl before you introduce yourself?" Cynthia jokingly criticized him, to which the man suddenly woke up and apologized.<br><br>He explained he was working for an adult website focused on public nudity in San Francisco, which was easy enough to guess given the circumstances. They were on the verge of creating new series with one of their boldest models, Cynthia, traveling through the financial district in the buff with far wider "audience" than she had before.<br><br>"Unfortunately, we didn't take into account that there'll also be a higher chance of meeting police," he added. "Anyway, I'm Charlie, happy to meet ya. Especially those of you with no clothes on."<br><br>The man bowed and kissed Leo's and Lala's hands with a grin on his face, shamelessly gazing at their curves without interruption.<br><br>"Wow. No wonder Sanflaria's diplomacy is so effective. Sending hot babes to negotiate clearly gives you an upper hand."<br><br>Leo waved her hand, as if she just received an elegant compliment, while Lala just blushed even more. Three naked girls stood like this for a moment, basking in the attention of the crowd, some of whom clearly supported them getting rid of the policeman with claps and V signs. Then, Cynthia asked to pose with the two, and they did a couple of sexy pictures, their nudity in stark contrast with the surrounding mundanity.<br><br>"Hm, if you don't mind me saying, you have interesting breasts," Leo suddenly said and poked at one of Cynthia's boobs.<br><br>"Ah yes, I had a boob job a while back so my breasts would fit the rest of my physique," Cynthia shook her large butt, clearly proud of it.<br><br>Leo and Lala looked at each other in silent surprise. They kept poking at Cynthia's breasts for a bit more in utter confusion while Charlie commemorated this moment with his camera. When Arnold explained what "boob job" actually was, the Sanflarians seemed even more confused.<br><br>"Why would you put some weird implants into your body?" Leo raised her eyebrow.<br><br>"Well, don't you have that?" Cynthia asked in surprise, "I thought the girls who go naked all the time would figure out a way to, well, enhance their looks."<br><br>Leo and Lala simultaneously shook their heads. The countess then explained that while many Sanflarian girls liked to add tattoos, piercings, or other permanent "accessories" to their look, it was mostly to emphasize something about the girl's character, not change physical aspects of her body. In their culture, shaming a woman--or anyone for that matter--for the aspects of their looks that couldn't be changed was a big taboo, and permanently naked females were especially taught to love themselves as they were created.<br><br>"Oh, how I wish I was born in Sanflaria!" Cynthia jested after this heartwarming story.<br><br>"Women like you are always welcome to visit," the countess gave the model a loud buttslap.<br><br>Cynthia replied in kind but her hand flew right back after encountering Leo's taut buttcheeks.<br><br>"Ouch," the model said with a hint of jealousy while Leo gave her a smug look.<br><br>The girls were happy to find new allies, chatting with Cynthia and letting Charlie snap pictures from all angles he wanted. Even Lala eased up a little since there was another girl she could share her naked burden with. Arnold felt the positivity rise in him as well, especially when he focused on the model's shapely, beautiful butt. Somehow, even when he thought he got used to naked women, it only took another one stripping to make him lose his mind again. The power of feminine beauty was not to be reckoned with.<br><br>"Alright," Charlie finally said as he landed both palms on the Sanflarians' butts without a hint of shame and leaned towards them, "it was very nice to meet you two, but we have to continue with our shooting. It's planned for my girl to walk all the way to the bus station, so she's got a long stroll ahead of her."<br><br>There was a hidden offer in his phrasing, and Leo took it right away with a playful wink to her new naked friend.<br><br>"We can walk together. Lala and I have some free time before our meeting, and it'll be nice to relax for a bit. Right?"<br><br>"R-right," the pink-haired girl forced a smile and gulped as she imagined herself walking through half a district, her body on full display.<br><br>Before, she was embarrassed to ride in a van and stand behind the door during the negotiations. Now those scenarios felt like dreams to her. Everything is learned in comparison, Lala thought as she started shivering again. Her only saving grace was Arnold, who was doubtful about letting the Sanflarians walk around after what happened in Nevada and didn't want to derail the schedule.<br><br>"Come on, my friend. We've got something amazing on our hands," Charlie said with a devilish grin. "I see you're a NIP admirer just like me. Didn't you ever want to not only see but be a part of such a shoot with the naked girls walking by your side? Not even once?"<br><br>Of course, the photographer already knew the answer.<br><br>***<br><br>The financial district seemed especially crowded and noisy today, with people walking slower than usual and even occasionally bumping into one another. The reason was clear to anyone close enough to see through the crowd: three gorgeous naked ladies walking down the streets at a leisurely pace, letting their feminine curves jiggle along with their steps. They strolled together and held hands, Cynthia being in the middle while Leo and Lala were on the sides. This allowed them to cover a wide part of the road with people stepping aside and letting them pass.<br><br>The girls' hips swayed from side to side as if they were models on a catwalk, demonstrating the latest trend in female fashion. Leo would agree with that interpretation aside from adding that unlike regular clothes, nudity never went out of fashion. Both Arnold and Charlie clearly agreed. The agent carefully followed the girls, looking for any kind of threat within a crowd with the thoroughness of a paranoid. The photographer, on the other hand, only had eyes--and lenses--for his beautiful models. He was far from the only one making photos, judging by all the phones pointed at Leo and her entourage.<br><br>While they were posing near one of the buildings, Cynthia took a moment to explain something about people taking pictures.<br><br>"There are usually three types of folks that do that," the model began while bending forward to highlight her magnificent ass. "The first ones will just remain in place and snap a couple of pics of you. Mostly to remember this moment or make sure their friends believe them when they get drunk and start boasting about it. Then, there are those who'll want to take a selfie with you to make themselves look cool. Boosts their confidence a little."<br><br>"And the third type?" Leo asked curiosly, then had to turn away because a couple teens came near her to take selfies.<br><br>One of the boys enveloped his hand around the countess' waist while his friend landed his palm on her shoulder.<br><br>"Oh, come on, don't be shy!" Leo suddenly grabbed both their palms and put in on her buttcheeks.<br><br>The teens blushed at first, but then one got bolder and squeezed Leo's breast with his free hand while her friend took the pictures. The blonde approved this by smiling at her admirer.<br><br>"Feels good to not feel those barriers, huh? You have plenty in your society. Good thing you've got me to show how it's supposed to be!"<br><br>"Careful!" Cynthia said with a giggle. "Encouraging men is good, but you have to maintain balance. Otherwise, they can lose their sense of boundaries."<br><br>Leo replied that if somebody does it, she has all means to respond. With this, the countess raised her arm and flexed her impressive muscles, causing the model to whistle and the spectators around to become more careful with what they did and said.<br><br>"Anyway, as I was saying. The third type are people who seem to be very interested in specific parts of your body and aren't shy to show it. Like that!"<br><br>Cynthia pointed at Lala, who puffed out her chest and showed V signs with both hands while an old man carefully took pictures of her nipples and pussy, nearly touching them with his phone lens. It looked like the pink-haired girl was holding back tears, her face entirely red, but Leo mistook it for excitement. What else could it be, given Lala's carefree and shameless nature?<br><br>"Yes, keep that up, hotties!" Charlie yelled in the mix of creative and sexual pleasure--the best mix there was.<br><br>These words seemed to have worked since the trio didn't hold back one bit: they hugged each other, shook their beautiful curves to the audience, and bent over to ensure great angles. The shooting went on until they saw the bus station, but even there Charlie didn't stop and instead asked them to get on the nearby lawn. It was a nice respite, during which the girls could lie on the grass, do stretches, and cheer up the weary office workers coming on and off the public transport. The photos became even more effective once Leo convinced Cynthia to take off her shoes and go barefoot.<br><br>The model still wore her earrings and a necklace, though, not trusting the crowd around her enough to hand them over. With that, the three nudists accidentally became somewhat of a chart for Sanflarian fashion while they played and turned in the grass. The first one was Cynthia, who preferred to go in shoewear and wore jewelry. The second one was Lala, barefoot but with bright make-up. Then, of course, came Leo with nothing at all, just like her Many-eyed God intended. Soon the shooting was over, but that didn't mean the fun had stopped. After all, the women still stood stark naked near the popular bus route.<br><br>"Thanks, it was great. You'd easily make it to the top in our business," Cynthia said with a hug to her new colleagues.<br><br>Then, she turned around and gave the same hug to Arnold, causing him to blush just like Lala did before.<br><br>"Come on, man, you gotta be a little more assertive," the photographer said when Cynthia turned to him, groping her entire backside while she graced him with an embrace as well.<br><br>Arnold sighed, unsure whether he was annoyed by Charlie's direct approach or a bit jealous of it. Either way, soon the pleasantries were over and Sanflarian girls were free to go. However, Charlie suggested they do another shooting together, saying it'd be good publicity for the website to have an alien nudist noble among their models.<br><br>Leo hesitated at first, but then he showed her the page itself, and the blonde's eyes started shining with excitement. An entire catalog of female Earthians baring it all in the public places of San Francisco, despite the societal pressure and the unjust laws aimed to prevent that. Surely she had to support this valiant effort!<br><br>"I'll send you cuties our contract so the website will own the photos I made of you, and then you can receive our standard model fee."<br><br>The blonde let out a kind but jesting giggle.<br><br>"No worries, Charlie. We don't need any money, we'll do it for the love of female nudity!"<br><br>And so it was decided. However, there was one more exchange between Leo and Cynthia that Arnold tried to stop, but just weren't fast enough: when the model began putting on her coat, the countess proudly exclaimed that she has to save her ally from the textile slavery and yanked it right from the model's hands. Before Cynthia knew it, her only clothing went to a nearby dumbster, buried between old cartons and rotting food. Lala gasped while Cynthia took a moment to process what happened.<br><br>"Well, now it's a no-lifeline shooting!" Charlie laughed. "What's wrong, Cynthia? It's not a big walk to my car, I'm sure you can do it. Besides, you're still shy sometimes, it'll be good to have some practice."<br><br>The model stood in silence for a moment, then bit her lip and looked at Leo with lust in her eyes. Whatever that coat was worth to her, it was certainly less than the excitement of going naked through the entire district. The nudies said their goodbyes as if they knew each other for years, and Cynthia was on her way, as nude as she came here. There was only one remaining question: how much time will it take for them to reach the Transamerica Pyramid now?<br><br>"My lady, I think we have to move quickly," Lala said, fighting her hectic breathing, "the van will soon be so far away we won't be able to catch it."<br><br>Leo raised her eyebrow as if Lala said something weird.<br><br>"The van? We aren't traveling with others anymore. After I finished talking to Araman, I said to not wait for us. Now we'll have to make our own way to the Pyramid."<br><br>"B-but how?" Lala asked, hopeful that her lady won't be insane enough to suggest they just streak all the way to the door.<br><br>Unfortunately, Leo's solution wasn't much better.<br><br>"Well, how do you think? We'll go by bus!"<br><br>Lala gulped once again. Leo told her about Earthian city transport after returning from Vegas. The tight boxes in which sweaty, angry people were packed like sardines in a can. She wouldn't call it a thrilling experience even by that description alone, but going in there naked? Unfortunately, Leo seemed to have already decided that, so the bodyguard could only follow her along. Still, Lala made a couple attempts to change her mistress' opinion.<br><br>"B-but what if there'll be a lot of people?" she whined.<br><br>"Don't worry, we don't need that much room!"<br><br>"W-what if they'll get aggressive?"<br><br>"Then we'll teach them a lesson in Sanflarian culture like we should!"<br><br>"What if there'll be, uh, children?" Lala was running out of options.<br><br>Leo smirked.<br><br>"Then we'll charge their moms for an extracurricular anatomy lesson. Why are you worrying so much? Both of us will be completely fine. There's nothing our equally strong and sexy bodies cannot handle."<br><br>Lala wished these words would add confidence, but her legs became weak again as she saw the bus. Judging by the amount of people on the station, it was going to be packed. As Leo confidently strolled to the transport, showered by shocked gazes and comments, her bodyguard realized that her problems were only just beginning.` },
      { title: "Chapter 5", summary: "The naked countess rides a bus naked.", content: `Dressed for Protesting<br><br>As soon as the girls walked into the bus, they could feel the gaze of every passenger on their naked bodies. Some people laughed while others shook their heads, but most of them seemed too engulfed in their daily routine to truly appreciate the beauty before them. The bus driver's reaction was a bit uncalled for: Arnold had to take a whole minute explaining to him who these women were and why they couldn't wear clothes since the man refused to start the bus at first.<br><br>Leo disregarded all the critics and gracefully strode to the middle of the bus, standing right in front of the seats, all of which were taken. Lala reluctantly followed behind her, constantly apologizing with a nervous smile when she bumped into someone with her impressive curves.<br><br>"Hey, look. Our pussies are right on their eye level. Awesome!" Leo pointed downwards, where a guy tried his best to avert his gaze from her hairless vulva that was inches from his face.<br><br>"Y-yeah, woo-hoo!" Lala said too loudly, then covered her face when the people looked at her with confusion.<br><br>The bus quickly left the station, and the skyscrapers started flowing by behind its windows. Having paid for all three tickets, Arnold neared the girls, feeling a movement in his pants that got stronger the closer he leaned towards them. Still, he couldn't focus on their beauty due to being anxious for them and kept his gun ready. This was a cramped space full of strangers. Who knew which one of them could pull out a knife?<br><br>Thankfully, it quickly turned out that even if some passengers tried reaching the naked girls, it wasn't to hurt them. One by one their hands began touching Leo's and Lala's naked figures, usually slapping their butts or groping their breasts in a jestful manner. The bodyguard closed her eyes, breathing heavily, while Leo went an exact opposite route: she boldly placed her legs shoulder-width and held on to the railing with both hands, making sure nothing could stop anyone from fondling her curves.<br><br>"Come on, don't be shy!" she said in an alluring voice while the men tripped over each other to get near her.<br><br>The attention the girls got only rose with time, especially when the bus stopped at several crowded stations and there were now so many people they could barely fit. It was hot and stuffy, but the entertainment more than made up for it. Most people tried ignoring Leo and Lala, but there were those who continued touching them. Some even got bold enough to land their hands on the girls' pussies, to which the bodyguard "accidentally" nudged them with her elbow while Leo simply asked them not to go too far.<br><br>"Behave yourselves, boys. I have to attend a serious diplomatic meeting in an hour; getting horny right now wouldn't help me to concentrate."<br><br>The folks around her kept gently pushing their luck, while a female voice in the crowd called the blonde a slut. Soon, several females left the bus, one of them even walking right past the naked girls.<br><br>"Cowards!" the blonde said victoriously.<br><br>"Oh, look. Free seats!" Lala exclaimed in a sudden fit of enthusiasm.<br><br>The blonde looked at her friend in surprise.<br><br>"You want to sit? Standing is much healthier. And besides, we'd deprive the locals of our Sanflarian beauty!"<br><br>Lala had to think on her feet before her shame became too obvious, and she did. Suddenly, the pink-haired girl screamed and grabbed her ankle as if she somehow twisted it on the spot. When Leo and Arnold rushed to her aid, she explained that she had a cramp and needed a moment to regain her footing. With that, the bodyguard could finally land her butt in a warm, albeit clearly not clean, seat.<br><br>Meanwhile, the bus got closer to the Transamerica Pyramid, and people started to leave, ready to begin their boring office lives. Arnold felt sympathy for them, thankful to the naked girl beside him that he didn't have to do the same anymore. Before leaving, however, Leo decided to give the passengers one final show and suddenly walked to the end of the bus.<br><br>"Since you've been such a good audience, I think you deserve one more good look," she smiled.<br><br>Some passengers scoffed and turned away while others whipped out their phones. Leo didn't leave them waiting and quickly enveloped one of her arms around the vertical railing near the door. Then, she pulled herself up and raised her leg like she was on a pole. Several passengers broke the awkward silence by applauding the countess' bravery as she began dancing.<br><br>Well, it was hard to call it a traditional dance since she had a very limited space, but she still made the most of it, spinning around on the railings, shocking the nearby folks by spreading her legs and even hanging upside down at one point, kept in place only by her strong legs. The driver turned on a slow song and barely kept himself from turning around, not regretting letting this girl in at all.<br><br>She finished with a graceful split in the air, achieved by putting her feet through the handle straps. The people were in awe, even though previously criticizing Leo for lack of modesty, they couldn't help but admire her athletic capabilities. When the bus stopped, the countess landed on the floor and bowed like an actor in a theater. But only after the doors opened and the unsuspecting passersby got a close-up of her majestic ass right in front of their faces.<br><br>Arnold couldn't help but laugh seeing how Leo was living an exhibitionist's dream. There was no doubt left in his mind that this girl was fearless. Partially because of the show, but also because she didn't hesitate to press her pussy and backside to the public transport's railing when the movement demanded it. Now that was a bold move and some serious dedication! But, just as everything good, their ride couldn't last forever. Soon, the naked duo ran out of the transport to meet the rest of the delegation.<br><br>"I see you had fun back there," Arnold smiled as he held Leo's hand, much to jealousy and surprise of many men around him.<br><br>"Indeed. And we weren't the only ones, judging by our happy audience!" the blonde replied and gave giggling Lala some light spanks.<br><br>They discussed Leo's show for a while longer, but then the blonde suddenly became serious. It happened right after she raised her head and saw the Pyramid towering above her, like a humongous monolith of Earthians' belief in business and commerce. The sight caused Leo to start repeating her tactics and talking points once more in her head, even ignoring the spectacle her and Lala's nudity was creating in the street.<br><br>Right now, that skyscraper wasn't just a piece of alien architecture for the countess. It represented the challenges of diplomacy she'll have to face very soon to achieve her task. The task that the blonde was determined to fulfill for the sake of her people.<br><br>However, as the trio walked to the building, they noticed something else. Or, rather, someone. Not the rest of the delegation, as they must've already entered, but instead several dozen Earthians, who looked no less alien compared to the regular public. They were noisy and angry, walking from side to side with signs in their hands. The police were nearby but didn't seem to know what to do with such a strange crowd.<br><br>There were both men and women, their numbers roughly equal. All of them were dressed in formal clothing, some even having retro styles that reminded Arnold of the 19th century. The females were all in long, voluminous dresses. Their outfits were things of beauty, but clearly too warm for this weather. Arnold realized it was a protest right away, and its reason also became apparent quickly.<br><br>As the group walked forward, they could finally read the signs. Well, except for Lala, but the emphatic girl could feel something was wrong as well. Phrases like "no shameless deals", "keep your curves away from kids", and "CMCF" could be seen all over while women in the crowd repeated them aloud. The protestors' collective mood became even less civil once they saw Leo and Lala and glared at them like a pack of wolves at their next meal.<br><br>"Well, this is bad," Arnold pointed out the obvious and hurried to get the nudies away.<br><br>However, Leo intervened.<br><br>"My lady, please!" the agent whined, "listen to me at least this once."<br><br>After all, if something happened to Eleonora of Kir'ador, being office plankton could've turned into a beautiful dream for Arnold.<br><br>"Come on. I didn't listen to you once in your Nevada province, and nothing bad has happened. Why would I start now?" the blonde jested, eager to see what the all the fuss was about.<br><br>The protestors quickly moved towards the Sanflarians as well, forcing both Arnold and Lala to prepare for a confrontation. They knew Leo wouldn't let anyone push her around, but there was no telling what to expect from these people. The atmosphere quickly turned sour as the protestors began yelling at the naked girls, and Leo saw one of them holding a drawing with a blonde, naked woman covered by black bars. This made the countess grit her teeth, and the pressure in the air began rising.<br><br>"What is going on, and who are you people? I've got an important meeting in this building, and there's no time for your silly jokes!" Leo proclaimed proudly, making some protestors take a step back.<br><br>An old man yelled something about shame, which several women supported, then the crowd moved apart to let somebody through. It was a tall, beautiful woman in her early thirties. She had an elegant face with deep, brown eyes and a modest look that made her seem reserved and traditional. She wore a long, dark dress and a jacket while her head was covered with a hat that looked like she stole it from Mary Poppins.<br><br>"God, you look preposterous!" Leo said before the woman could even speak a word. "Did you pull those rags out of a dumpster?"<br><br>The crowd gasped in unison while the brunette stood flabbergasted at this insult. Yet, she didn't back away, instead taking a step forward. The blonde once again demanded to be let into the skyscraper, but Mary Poppins refused, and even Arnold's ICA credentials didn't help this time.<br><br>"We will not let you talk with these dirty men and produce that filthy adult film of yours. This country has enough issues with morality, and bimbos walking naked in public surely isn't something we need to add."<br><br>"If you only see a bimbo because of my nudity, you should get your eyes checked, woman," Leo scoffed in response. "Who am I speaking to, anyway?"<br><br>"We are Textilians!" she said too proudly for a goofy name like that, "a movement dedicated to stopping your takeover of our country! My name is Elizabeth, and I'm the leader and spokeswoman of these people. We won't let your immoral, shameless behavior be forced upon our mothers and daughters. We are sorry about your upbringing that made you believe that flaunting your curves in front of everyone is normal, but this barbaric behavior has no place in the US!"<br><br>Both naked girls looked at each other in sheer confusion as the crowd supported Elizabeth with more yelling. She said something else, but her voice got drowned out in angry protestors talking over each other as they tried to insult the delegates.<br><br>"Immoral? That's coming from a woman who covers her natural beauty with clothing and makes others do the same? I'm freely showing my body because it was gifted to me by the Many-eyed One. You, however, are a victim of misleading who's afraid of her own image because of what your prudish elders taught you. You know, I've grown to accept that you have your own weird rules, but you don't get to rub them in my face. It's simply rude."<br><br>"Rude? You're saying that after shaking your... lady bits in front of everyone you see? The nerve!" replied Elizabeth.<br><br>Arnold started calling the rest of his squad, who were on standby just around the corner. It seemed that they prepared for everything except for a peaceful protest, and the US's lax attitude towards such gatherings may have played a trick on them this time. The only option left was trying to defuse the situation, but the chances to do it dwindled as the women grew angrier.<br><br>"Listen!" the agent finally mustered up the courage, "how about we all calm down and..."<br><br>He was immediately cut off.<br><br>"I'm doing this for your sake, you cretins," Leo didn't back down, "so you can actually see our perspective on things through that documentary instead of filling your heads with lies you've made up yourselves!"<br><br>"A culture that robs their women of basic dignity has no place here!" Elizabeth parried. "If this show hits our TV screens, it'll traumatize our children forever!"<br><br>She extended her hand and pulled a boy close to herself. That boy must've been son of a middle-aged woman standing next to Elizabeth; the only weird thing is that he looked about Arnold's age, and his mom seemed to treat him as if he was still a kid. Even turned his head so he wouldn't look at the naked beauties in front of him.<br><br>"I don't know. Look, your friend's son is surely enjoying it. It's completely normal for a man. If he behaves himself, he can stare as much as he likes!"<br><br>The 20-year-old guy was smiling from ear to ear as he ogled Leo's fit, shapely form, with a drool hanging in the corner of his mouth.<br><br>"Stop it. You're scaring him!" Elizabeth closed the guy's eyes.<br><br>"I don't know, Lizzy. It looks like he enjoys it."<br><br>The brunette yelled again, demanding Leo not call her Lizzy, but this made her too slow in reacting to the blonde's next move. To prove her point, Leo grabbed the man, pulled him right from his mother's embrace, and pressed his face to her impressive chest. The man squealed with joy and "accidentally" grabbed one of Leo's breasts, making it seem like he was trying to break free but clearly not wanting that to happen. Elizabeth reacted with an angry cry while the crowd encircled the naked duo.<br><br>"I'm sure there's a peaceful solution to this!" Arnold tried his best one last time.<br><br>But, sure enough, it was too late. One of the crazed Textilians had already grabbed Leo by the hair and tried to scratch her neck with her nails. If only they were open-minded enough to see her more than a bimbo, maybe they'd recognize the danger they were in.<br><br>"Lala, formation!" Leo yelled while giving one of the female protestors an elbow.<br><br>"Yes!" the bodyguard stood back to back with her mistress, and the two assumed fighting stances. What followed was the least pleasant type of violence--the political one.<br><br>Two girls lunged at Leo simultaneously, but she skillfully dodged and grabbed one of their dresses. Before the victim could react, the blonde ripped it to shreds in a graceful spin, then turned to her friend and pulled her hem over her face, causing her to lose sight. Meanwhile, Lala saw a bulky, bearded man running right at her and ducked to avoid his punch. Then, she tripped him with a sweep and landed an uppercut while he was falling.<br><br>"Sorry, you've left me no choice!" the girl said with the same nervous giggle.<br><br>The guy's jaw cracked, and he fell on the asphalt with a thud. His skinny friend tried to pull out his pepper spray, but Lala bent his arm backwards and turned his lights off with a swift hit to the neck. Then came a woman who yelled something as she put Lala's hands behind her back. The bodyguard swiftly stepped on her foot and turned around, still apologizing.<br><br>It took one motion to rip the woman's blouse and release her large, plump tits from their textile prison. The assailant stared at her bare chest in shock, then slapped Lala while covering her boobs with another hand. The bodyguard replied in kind on a pure reflex, sending her topless opponent flying to the ground with a powerful smack.<br><br>Leo acted even quicker, as she wasn't as bulky and couldn't rely on her muscles like her friend did. Instead, she decided to humiliate her opponents as much as possible for attacking her. She jumped once the next man tried subduing her, which resulted in his face getting buried in between her legs. Then Leo drove them both to the ground and nearly choked him out with her ass on top of his face.<br><br>But her female opponents suffered an even harsher fate. Despite the bikini-clad girl trying to leave, Leo turned her around and tore her underwear off, locks and waistbands destroyed in an instant. The protestor's friend also got naked in mere seconds, after which the countess pushed both of them into the crowd.<br><br>They shrieked while landing on top of their fellow Textilians, trying their best to cover their small tits and hairy pussies while tripping over each other. The men's cheeks burned from shame as well, especially when they accidentally started groping the girls' bodies in this chaos.<br><br>A third woman, a tomboyish type with short hair and muscular physique, tried attacking Leo but paid for it dearly. She nearly got tangled in her own destroyed dress when it collapsed with a loud, ripping sound. But it became much worse when she was left in only a thong, her hands clutching onto her flat chest. Leo glanced at the underwear's slim, red lines like a predator, then exclaimed:<br><br>"It looks like you aren't too modest down there, are you?"<br><br>Before the tomboy could protect herself, Leo suddenly pulled her thong's strings upwards and gave the girl the worst wedgie of her life. The sturdy underwear nearly reached her ears and got so deep into her pussy she could've demanded it to marry her. When the garment tore, it was more of a relief than an embarrassment. The tomboy was still whining on her knees when a middle-aged, larger woman bumped into Leo and almost made her fall.<br><br>The blonde managed to catch herself and rolled to the side. In the very second, she was right behind the chubby woman with her hands on the dress straps. The woman tried grabbing Leo but realized she couldn't move her arms: Leo destroyed the upper part of her clothing, leaving her topless and tying her with the fabric.<br><br>"You... you slut!" the woman yelled, her naked breasts bouncing up and down.<br><br>She tried covering herself, but couldn't do anything with her arms pinned to her sides. But the anger within her still demanded action, so she lunged at Leo and bit one of her tits like a savage, landing her teeth on the girl's nipple. Leo screamed in pain and quickly replied with a stiff knee to the woman's belly. She fell down with a wail, and Leo got on top of her, ready to continue the humiliation.<br><br>"Wanna use bites during a regular combat? Bad girl, you deserve to get spanked!" Leo said with laughter, then pushed the woman's dress down and tore it off completely along with her underwear.<br><br>The woman cried out in shame as her clothes were gone and her round, chubby curves got exposed for everyone to see. But this wasn't the worst part, as right after that Leo began slapping her ass like a giant drum. The blonde gave it all to her strikes, even creating a rhythm in the process while the butt's owner screamed in pain below her.<br><br> "Hey, that's my wife!" a male voice called from above the blonde.<br><br>The large woman's buttocks were completely red now, and it seemed like her middle-aged, balding husband wanted to do the same to Leo. However, she was quicker once again, so instead of landing his palm at her, the man hit his own wife right at her pussy, making her scream even louder.<br><br>"Sorry, I don't wanna interrupt this couple moment!" Leo exclaimed as she pushed the man right at his wife, making them both fall and struggle to get up when the woman's naked curves got right into her man's face.<br><br>The Sanflarians kept fighting, the amount of half- and fully naked women around them rising with each second. Some Textilians ran away in panic while Elizabeth urged them to stay and fight while staying behind herself. Lala finally forgot about her embarrassment as she protected her mistress from harm. Leo, on the other hand, felt even better as she tore apart Textilians' posters and dresses of their wives.<br><br>Arnold didn't share their optimism. He was in complete shock. He'd expect this protest to turn violent, but wouldn't ever think it'd happen so quickly. Usually, for such counterprotests, there was at least a week of mutual insults before that! He thought about pulling out a gun but timely remembered that he also had a taser. It turned out to be a useful tool when two bigger, angrier men tried attacking Arnold, and he managed to shock both of them with a quick buzz. <br><br>All three were sweating and panting as the chaos grew around them. Thankfully, the rest of the ICA and the local police arrived quickly enough to prevent further escalation. They broke through the crowd and separated the delegates while the crowd kept raging. A burly Sanflarian guard ran up to Leo and hoisted her on his shoulder. The blonde gasped as her tender, naked skin got into contact with the cold metal of his armor. Her next emotion was clearly anger since she started to hit the armor and demanded the soldier let her go.<br><br>"Stop it this instant! I've got at least two signs I have to destroy, and I still haven't snatched Lizzy's gown."<br><br>"Apologies, my lady, but by your father's orders we cannot let you get hurt!" his muffled yet chivalrous voice rang out through the helmet.<br><br>"Imagine doing that by carrying me away instead of helping me strip those chicks!" Leo scoffed in disbelief.<br><br>The soldier kept running towards the van while Leo's plump booty swayed back and forth near his face. Being Sanflarian, he disregarded her nudity and didn't even think about the amazing view of her vulva he gave to all the passersby. But it only lasted for a minute since Leo and Lala quickly got into the transport where Araman was already waiting with a disgruntled look on his face. Nothing seemed to go according to plan today.` },
      { title: "Chapter 6", summary: "The naked countess takes part in negotiations.", content: `Business with Pleasure<br><br>The sun was setting behind the office's windows, engulfing the streets below in orange light. San Francisco seemed both big and small from this height, with the entire city in full view of the guests. The delegation was waiting here for almost an hour, but nobody complained. The office was spacious and good on the eyes with its dark colors, while the furniture was better than many could ever see in their own houses. It was clear it wasn't meant for a regular employee.<br><br>"Ha-ha-ha, look at them. Oh help me, Many-eyed!" Leo said as she scrolled through social media on Arnold's laptop.<br><br>It took the countess a moment to master this new technology, but, being a highly intelligent and educated being, she soon learned what all the buttons did and began giggling in front of the screen like a child watching Cocomelon. The media she watched was centered around one topic only: Textilian women running around naked in public. Their skirmish was only an hour ago, but it already went viral with photos and videos of the poor, embarrassed protesters filling the web.<br><br>It turned out that while some of them had husbands or friends who lent them clothing, others either came alone or were so panicked they separated from the group, now forced to streak through the busy streets and cause even more raised eyebrows than Leo herself. The countess thoroughly enjoyed this irony. In fact, she couldn't get enough of the unlucky girls' jiggling butts and rosy cheeks as their figures scuttled around the city with their hands clutching their privates. Lala stood beside her in silence, with a deeply hidden empathy for the girls' shame.<br><br>"So this is a network that allows people to comment on everything that's happening right now?" Leo pointed at the black-and-white logo. "Huh, what a trinket! My world also might need one of those."<br><br>"Uh... No, trust me, you don't," Arnold said this so firmly he surprised even himself.<br><br>It surprised the agent that Sanflarians didn't have internet. Well, they had a similar technology allowing them to freely share information, but it was much more strictly regulated and meant mostly for governmental or business needs, not entertainment. When Arnold asked how regular Sanflarians lived without it, Leo explained that everything they needed could be found on separate data modules, which they'd connect to their appliances.<br><br>This way, a Sanflarian could easily get access to all of their nation's literature with the local version of an ebook or upload useful functions to a spherical computer labeled by the locals "infocore" that most upper-class citizens had on their person, but these modules were premade. Folks with tech smarts could customize them, but it was implied that Sanflaria chose specific content to shelter their citizens from informational garbage and keep them from finding something they didn't need to.<br><br>Likewise, most communication within the network itself only concerned narrow, professional topics, so hobby communities or Sanflarian version of "fandoms" gathered offline. As a result, their information field was clean and to the point, never reaching levels of chaos that one Google search could've brought upon an unsuspecting user from Earth. It was efficient but strictly regulated, not allowing one to stray from the course too much. Just like Sanflaria itself.<br><br>Speaking of strictness, Araman just walked into the room, to which everyone got up and greeted him. The baron waved them off and briefly pointed at the door. A second later, another figure entered the room, all eyes on it now. It was a short, somewhat stocky man past his prime. He had a blue suit, a briefcase in one hand, and, clearly, a wig meant to hide either graying or balding. The man's face was adorned with a wide smile.<br><br>The whole delegation straightened their backs in reflex. This unimposing man might've been mistaken for some lawyer or salesman to others, but they knew him as Mr. Maitre, a millionaire, politician, and one of the three investors Kir'ador was about to work with on the documentary. Maitre politely greeted the guests and wiped the sweat off his brow with a handkerchief, panting a little.<br><br>"Can you believe it? We're in the most important building in San Francisco, but even here we can't escape the breaking elevators," he said with a jest and walked right to the main table. "I'm sorry I had to keep you waiting. But, as you can understand, this was neither side's fault. Force majeures happen, but I'm sure those textians, or however they call themselves, will soon feel the consequences."<br><br>"Some of them already did," Leo said with a giggle, closing the laptop.<br><br>Mr. Maitre looked up to see the two naked girls standing right in front of his workplace and said something in French, clearly enjoying the view. Leo winked at Araman and puffed out her chest in a newfound boost of confidence. Even this fat cat wasn't immune to her and Lala's charm.<br><br>"Will the other two of our investors not come today?" Araman then asked.<br><br>"Unfortunately, since we couldn't meet in time, they've already left. We millionaires are busy people, you know," Maitre chuckled at his own joke. "For now, it's just me. But no worries; I shall give you all the necessary contact information so you can discuss everything with Mr. Gelbstein and Mr. Luxe later."<br><br>"Alright, let's go one at a time, shall we?" Leo leaned forward towards the man, letting her large breasts bounce right in front of his face. Lala awkwardly followed her lady, forcing a wide smile that looked more creepy and demented than alluring.<br><br>"Of course. Please have a seat," he seemed completely unfazed by this showcase of female beauty.<br><br>Leo must've misunderstood his previous gesture, then.<br><br>"Oh, I'm sorry, not to insult you," Maitre said, noting the blonde's dissatisfaction, "you two are remarkably beautiful women. But, let's not beat around the bush, I'm gay. I can only admire the aesthetic aspect of your forms, which, let me say, is simply stunning! But I do apologize in advance if my reaction to you isn't what you came to expect from our men."<br><br>Araman grinned--for the first time since their journey began--when he saw Leo pout as she realized her magic won't work this time. It looked like this time, she'll have to play by the rules.<br><br>Surprisingly, the negotiation that followed went quite well. Both Leo and Lala came to appreciate their investor's lack of sexual interest since the conversation with him flowed very naturally, reminding them of how Sanflarian males who saw naked women all the time would treat them--like women who were beautiful, but not out of the ordinary. The bodyguard was especially happy about that, though still dreading the thought of walking back through the entire tower and exposing herself to its numerous workers.<br><br>Overall, Mr. Maitre seemed already interested in the idea of a Sanflarian documentary, so the delegates didn't have to do much convincing. Instead, Leo and Araman focused more on the series' general direction and points they were trying to make. Arnold was surprised at how well the two coordinated their opinions despite them being different. Even if they had some squabbles, they didn't let them overtake their common goal.<br><br>The investor liked the approach that'd make people understand the depth of Sanflarian culture and promote tolerance of their traditions to the masses. That way, he said, they could effectively lay the groundwork for future cooperation. He carefully listened to Leo's words about the appeal female nudity could have on Earth and agreed with her.<br><br>However, he also urged them to focus on how free and liberated it made Sanflarian women feel, stating that this fell in line with an agenda he was already trying to push and that naked girls didn't need to be emphasized to be appealing. This seemed perfectly reasonable to Leo. She thought she'd have to fight for a possibility to show her female compatriots as personalities rather than just pieces of bare ass, but Maitre suggested it himself. It looked like a win-win situation, at least at the moment.<br><br>When they walked out into the main building's hallway system, with Leo proudly walking first and Lala nervously stepping beside her with an unhealthy smile on her lips, Arnold took the countess by the hand and whispered:<br><br>"Listen, I... I just wanted to say that I wouldn't put my full trust in him. Mr. Maitre is a political heavyweight, and they always seem to find ways to, y'know..."<br><br>"No worries, my fellow warrior, I understand," Leo replied. "Don't you underestimate us just because we're not of this world. Both Araman and I are very careful with what we say and what we hear from these moneymakers. For now, though, we'll have to work with Maitre the best we can while looking for contact his two friends. Then we'll think about our general strategy regarding this trio."<br><br>It didn't take long for the delegation to establish contact with Mr. Gelbstein. He called himself while they were driving back to the hotel, albeit indirectly, through his clearly underslept assistant. Her tired, monotonous voice rang out through the van's speakerphones as she relayed what her boss told her:<br><br>"Mr. Gelbstein is very sorry about what you had to endure. However, he couldn't skip his next meeting and couldn't wait until your issues were resolved," she said with a surprisingly stern tone. "That said, he is still interested in financing the documentary you're planning to make. Considering he has the largest capital out of the group, his investment will be quite noticeable. However, he'll only take part in this deal under one condition."<br><br>"And that is..?" Leo, being honest and direct, couldn't stand such long preambles.<br><br>"It must be profitable."<br><br>The delegates looked at each other in confusion. A second ago, they expected an obscure demand like making it only in certain locations or including an endorsement of that man's company, but this was so simple it threw them off a little.<br><br>"We hope it will be, as Sanflarian culture receives peak interest from the general public right now, owing to the Interworld Cooperation Act of 2025," Araman said in response.<br><br>"Unfortunately, hoping is not enough. You see, Mr. Gelbstein never worked with Sanflarians before, and the lack of previous media with your involvement makes it impossible to..." she stopped to yawn and kept reading her prepared statement, "impossible to predict the commercial value of this venture. Especially with the social backlash such as one you've encountered today from the so-called Textilians."<br><br>It took the Sanflarians a minute to decipher that corporate speak, but Leo understood what she meant by pure instinct and began speaking first:<br><br>"Alright, we understand that being a millionaire requires you to care about money. But did Mr. Gelbstein think about the opportunity to expand the Earth's understanding of Sanflaria? To be one of the first people associated with the new age of interworld communication? To do other great things, all of your shareholder people seem to like so much? We had a lot of offers, you know, including from your government. Though that one turned out to have too many strings attached, there are still options to choose from."<br><br>Mr. Gelbstein's assistant sighed, unsure of how to deal with this resistance.<br><br>"Listen, I understand that you're serious people, and my boss wants to work with you. He just wants to be sure it'll suit him. If you can find any proof that people are willing to pay for Sanflarian culture and not just read about it online for free, we've got the deal."<br><br>They argued a bit more, but soon it became clear to both Araman and Leo that keeping Gelbstein in the deal was worth more than letting him get out, so they grudgingly agreed. The countess would've probably ended up breaking the speaker and challenging Gelbstein to a duel if she had been by herself, but her cool-headed partner convinced her to use a softer approach. Though it did make her a little mad, she was still thankful to Araman for preventing her from losing her head.<br><br>"Well, it looks like your charms were countered again, my lady," Arnold jested. "Not only was that assistant a woman, but she also couldn't see any of you through that speaker! W-what? Don't look at me like that. I just mean that you should be ready for things like that and not let them get to you, is all!"<br><br>"Who said anything about that getting to me?" Leo raised her eyebrow with a smirk. "Laugh while you can, boy. The last of the three will surely fall victim to my allure!"<br><br>Arnold simply nodded, realizing Leo will win this argument through her attitude.<br><br>"What, you want to make this a bet? I'm ready!"<br><br>"A bet?"<br><br>"Yes, a bet. If the last guy falls to my feminine charm, you'll have to... um, let's see."<br><br>She fell silent for a second, then clicked her fingers so loudly Arnold jumped in his seat.<br><br>"You'll have to convince a girl to strip naked in public! A complete stranger from your own world, mind you."<br><br>The agent felt his cheek become rosy and his hand begin to tremble as soon as he imagined this scenario. Him walking on a street and asking a random beautiful girl to strip for him? That'd probably end up with him getting called a pervert, embarrassing himself, and possibly wanted by the police. Still, there was something in Leo's eyes, a hidden challenge that didn't let Arnold back down so easily.<br><br>"And if you lose?" he suddenly exclaimed, causing the countess' grin to become even wider.<br><br>"Choose whatever punishment you deem necessary!"<br><br>"Any restrictions?"<br><br>"Try me!" she asked, glaring at him with mystery in her eyes.<br><br>Suddenly, Arnold felt a lack of words. Leo's smug look made him want to ask for something equally humiliating for the girl, something that'd make her blush just like he did a second ago. But what could it be with such a shameless, fearless amazon? One would naturally think about sex, but it felt kind of cheap and, surprisingly, didn't seem that enticing compared to what Leo was already doing in front of him. So Arnold buried deep into his perverted fantasies and fetishes, fishing out the spiciest public stunt he could've thought of. Within the realm of possibility, of course.<br><br>However, when he whispered it to Leo, she simply laughed at the suggestion.<br><br>"Walk me on a leash like I'm your pet? Okay, okay, you're not so simple as I thought you were," the blonde whispered back and bit her lip in excitement. "Alright, have it your way. I'll even act like a doggie as much as you'll like if you win this one."<br><br>With that, they shook hands, both anxious and eager to see where this impulsive decision would lead them.` },
      { title: "Chapter 7", summary: "Leo and Lala find a new way to attract even more attention.", content: `Call to Action<br><br>The hotel met them with a relaxing atmosphere--a nice change of pace after such a chaotic day. Maybe this wasn't Leo's fabled castle, but with the warm lamplights, silky cushions, and a couple of butt-naked cleaners on her beck and call, it could almost pass off as part of her homeland. A large TV on the wall was a nice addition, especially when it started showing news about Leo's and Lala's adventures today.<br><br>However, before the blonde could watch any of them, there was a knock on the door. The girls went to answer with hints of anxiety, hopeful that it wasn't a Textilian or some nosy paparazzi again. Instead, they saw a short yet stylish man with a file in his hands. Right after Leo opened the door, Charlie politely bowed to both ladies and invited himself in.<br><br>"What's the reason for your visit?" Arnold asked the photographer. "You know these are foreign diplomats, right?"<br><br>"Of course, man, I don't mean to tread on your toes. Just brought the contracts from the website's owners. They were ve-e-ery pleased with the photos we made!" his lips curled in a proud smirk.<br><br>"Of course, come in!" Leo said cheerfully and let the photographer into their spacious bedroom, to which he reacted with a whistle.<br><br>"Not bad. You must've been saving on clothes all your life to afford it!"<br><br>Both girls giggled at the joke while Arnold kept a straight face, too focused on the word "contracts". Soon he had an opportunity to see the papers for himself, as Leo gave them to him to make sure these were legit by US standards. While reading them, he couldn't help but feel another wave of excitement rising within him. It was a standard procedure, really, as the models had to allow the websites to use their naked likeness for commercial purposes.<br><br>But it still was incredibly hot. Not only did the girl agree to strip naked in public for everyone to see, but she also made her nudity somebody else's property, ensuring that it won't get scrubbed off the internet no matter what. There was altruism to that, the one that, in the mind of Arnold, clearly separated such women from those using their nudity as leverage. Especially this time, with "no monetary compensation" written in bold letters. It's not like Leo would need it, but it was still a very classy move on her part.<br><br>"Those are fine," he finally concluded, handing the contracts back.<br><br>"Told ya! Now, who wants to see the photos?" Charlie asked, to which Leo nodded first, with Lala reluctantly agreeing.<br><br>The photographer sat at the worktable and pulled out his laptop. The countess stood near him, blessing everyone around her with a gorgeous sight of her curves as she leaned forward. However, Charlie had something else in mind: as soon as the folder was opened, he patted himself on the lap, inviting Leo to sit. She jokingly rolled her eyes but accepted the invitation and soon sat on the man's lap, enveloping her hand around his neck.<br><br>A wide grin appeared on his face as he started opening pictures while caressing Leo's beautiful body with his free hand, not ashamed of groping her in the slightest. This mood seemed to vibe well with Leo, who kept positioning himself so that Charlie'd have an easier time fondling her wherever he pleased. After seeing so many men protest against her nakedness as Textilians, it was nice for the countess to meet one who loved naked girls just as she did.<br><br>The showing was a successful one: even though both Lala and Arnold were a bit awkward at the start of it, the shared memories of today's morning overtook their anxiety and let them enjoy the photos as much as Charlie did. The company discussed the pictures with the men showering the naked girls with compliments, sometimes laughing at the odd angles or passersby's reactions.<br><br>Despite all being bold, naked women, each of the three had her own unique energy. Leo was strong yet graceful, her athleticism and femininity blending into one captivating mix. She looked like she'll stay naked forever, and even if the entire world were against her, it'll end up becoming CMNF as well.<br><br>Cynthia was a sleeping volcano of sexuality, covering it behind grins and playful stares but ready to unleash it through her shameless posing and confidence whenever she felt like it. Leo even gave the model compliments later, commending her for contributing to their honorable cause. Cynthia was honored, although when Leo told her that in Sanflaria men didn't ogle their women's bodies and OnlyFans wouldn't be profitable there at all, the model suddenly got nervous.<br><br>Then, there was Lala. A shy, giggly girl who, as Charlie said, would "fit right into the ENF tag".<br><br>"She must've been holding back," Leo said. "Lala's the most shameless gal I know. Right, bestie?"<br><br>"Y-yeah, I was just playing a role," she bowed and everybody laughed as soon as Leo translated this phrase.<br><br>Arnold giggled as well, even though deep down he didn't buy it. The agent knew how anxiety and awkwardness looked too well to mix it up with something else. Yet, it didn't seem like the right moment to discuss that, so he turned his attention back to the photos for now.<br><br>Once they reached the middle of the gallery, Leo got up, having allowed Charlie's hand to traverse all across her body at this point. Then, she offered her place to Lala. But only after being rewarded for her cooperation with a loud buttslap.<br><br>The bodyguard agreed, although it took some convincing, then got even redder since Charlie's hand quickly began squeezing her breast. Deep inside, Lala wanted to scream, but she could only keep watching the pictures of her public humiliation with everyone around her talking and jesting about her naked body as if she enjoyed it.<br><br>When she felt Charlie's hand land on her vulva, she jumped with a shriek, causing even more laughs. The photographer was a bit surprised, especially after Leo let him freely stroke her pussy just a minute before. Lala had to take a moment of respite, so she bolted out of the room, saying she needed to adjust her make-up. Just what did she get herself into when she raised that hand? <br><br>After Charlie uploaded the set and Leo read the first comments, she suddenly remembered the talk with Gelbstein.<br><br>"Are these people paying to see us naked?" the countess asked.<br><br>"Hell yeah, and they pay very well!"<br><br>Arnold nodded, remembering all of the public nudity websites and OnlyFans pages he paid for before getting a chance to see his fantasy for free with Eleonora.<br><br>"Do you suppose we can use this fact to prove a point?" Leo asked both men, who then looked at each other with a barely hidden excitement.<br><br>"What do you have in mind?" Charlie finally asked.<br><br>After Leo told the photographer about Mr. Gelbstein and their talk, he turned to thinking.<br><br>"Yes, I think if you relay your message clearly, put it online, and add a nice-looking visual of your cute naked butt, people's attention will skyrocket. Especially with you and your bestie already flashing your pixelated bodies in the news."<br><br>"I hate when they do that!" Leo scoffed. "Sorry, just a cultural thing. Continue."<br><br>Charlie explained that a good way to test people's engagement would be creating a donation page. They'd collect a sum of money for their part of the investment and show Gelbstein that female nudity indeed does sell despite Textilians all other backlash. He also added that he was ready to help with setting it up if Leo and Lala agreed to another photoshoot for his NIP website later on.<br><br>"You got it! What do we need to do?" the blonde asked.<br><br>"I mean, like I said, visuals are the most important part. We can choose something from our latest shooting. Then add a couple of ugly Textilians from the protest, and we'll be set."<br><br>The pros of this idea clearly outweighed the cons. After all, Sanflaria didn't risk anything with this idea, and it seemed like the fastest way to reach out to Gelbstein's greed. So the group spent half an hour trying to choose the best picture, with Charlie providing his professional commentary and Arnold speaking of his experience as a long-time NIP content consumer.<br><br>Eventually, they settled on a photo where Leo and Lala stood at the sides of the sidewalk surrounded by dozens of gawkers and pointed at Cynthia, who was posing between them. All of them had their legs at shoulder width and were leaning slightly forward, as if to give the pedestrians a better look at their athletic backsides. The combined allure created by the trio of their beautiful bodies was something many erotic photographers could've only dreamed of.<br><br>"I think it looks great," Charlie said.<br><br>"Yes. Both sexy and wholesome, the best kind of public nudity! I mean... I just think so," Arnold nodded with a slight blush.<br><br>"True. It looks like I and Lala are inspiring this Earthian to be happy and proud of her nudity. Exactly the point of our campaign. I like that. And what do you think, bestie?"<br><br>Lala didn't respond to her mistress' words. She froze right after remembering the feeling of all those gazes traveling across her bare, unprotected body like hundreds of ants with their stings at the ready. Apparently, Leo interpreted it as her being in awe of her own beauty and told Charlie to continue. The photographer quickly put up a draft of their donation page but left the text field empty for the countess to fill up as she pleased.<br><br>"Alright, I have to get going. Remember that photoshoot you owe me now!" Charlie smirked and hid away his camera like it held all the riches of mankind.<br><br>Both Leo and Lala hugged him and gave him a gentle peck on the lips as the sign of their gratitude. Right after the photographer left, Leo got to Arnold's laptop and started working on the page. The agent was supposed to be going as well, but it felt too nice looking at the blonde work while lying on the bed. This position perfectly highlighted her nice-looking buttocks that jiggled a bit each time she came up with a new idea and flinched in excitement. Finally, Leo noticed and turned towards her friend, who was completely hypnotized at this point.<br><br>"I can feel you eyeing my gorgeous rear, you know," she said, shaking her butt with suggestion. "Why don't you give it a good rub? A little massage, if you will."<br><br>"Oh, of course I'd love to!" the agent said, but then hesitated.<br><br>"What's wrong? Still shy? I thought we'd been through this," Leo jokingly scolded him with her finger.<br><br>Arnold let out a sigh while trying to form an explanation. He tried to be bolder and more assertive, but it still didn't come out right. Especially when compared to other, more assertive males like Charlie, who didn't feel any anxiety when approaching girls at all.<br><br>"I just... you're my friend, you know."<br><br>"So what? I can be both your friend and a sexy piece of ass. Ass that you're freely allowed to touch whenever you wish, mind you. My beauty and my personality don't have to undo one another, remember?" she shook her behind once again, enjoying the sight of Arnold's eyes following it along.<br><br>He tried to explain why he acted like this, but words didn't come out of his mouth. All in all, it still didn't feel natural for Arnold to see such a beauty in front of him. And for her to allow him to grope her as much as he wished? It was simply unbelievable, his mind just turned off from such possibilities.<br><br>Fortunately, Leo already knew him well enough and saw through that ashamed demeanor.<br><br>"No worries, my ally. You're already getting more confident, but it takes both time and effort. You truly should become more upfront with your desires, but for the time being, I think we can help!"<br><br>With these words, the blonde grabbed Arnold's hand and pulled him onto the bed. The agent's cheeks became red like tomatoes when she realized Leo didn't just land his hands on her body but started hugging him just like in that motel in Nevada. His face got buried between the countess' tits again, and he became hard as a rock in seconds.<br><br>"Here, breathe in this experience!" Leo said, chuckling and wriggling on top of the man.<br><br>Lala laughed, but this time, it was loud and sincere. The scene really lifted up her mood and finally let her see somebody being embarrassed more than she was. The blonde called her to join them, and she jumped onto the king-sized bed along with the two.<br><br>"Wowie, now that's a fight we'll surely win!" the bodyguard added.<br><br>Arnold felt like he was in heaven, only with nude female bodies instead of the clouds. Leo and Lala embraced and tickled the agent, sometimes even landing his palms on their curves to let him enjoy this moment to the fullest. The trio spends the next twenty minutes like this--laughing, turning, and touching one another, with Arnold's shame gradually fading away from the girls' caresses.<br><br>The next day was going to be a busy one, but a rest like this made it all more than worth it.<br><br>***<br><br>When Arnold woke up, he didn't understand where he was at first. The sunlight peeking through the curtains and keyboard typing nearby slowly took the man from his dreams and returned him to reality.<br><br>"Oh man, did I dream that last evening?" he asked himself with a frown.<br><br>"No, you didn't! Although that depends on what you're talking about," Leo's voice rang out from the right.<br><br>Arnold turned around and saw his blonde naked friend lying nearby with his laptop. Now he remembered: he thought it was time for him to go after the three got frisky, but Leo suggested he rest at her bed while she's working. Well, the rest was surely better than expected, with Arnold sleeping through the whole night in his uniform.<br><br>He also remembered what happened before that. A magical moment that he probably won't ever forget. When they got enough of tickling and touching each other, Arnold jokingly leaned to Leo to give her a peck on the cheek. Instead, the blonde turned towards him and gave him a long, passionate kiss on the lips like in romantic movies.<br><br>"Don't let competition discourage you. Use it to your advantage. You can be brave and fearless; I saw it in you during that firefight in Vegas. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise," Leo said to him back then with a smile.<br><br>Arnold was speechless. When he first saw this countess, he'd never think she could be so soft and wise at the same time. Not only did she realize he was concerned about him being too shy compared to Charlie, but she also found the best way to combat such thoughts.<br><br>"T-thank you, Leo," the agent said with a blush.<br><br>"No biggie," she replied. "Also, I'm almost finished with the text. Care to check it out?"<br><br>"Sure!"<br><br>Arnold leaned over to the blonde's side of the bed but froze as he saw another person in the hallway nearby. It was one of the cleaners, a petite blonde with a bright smile on her face, who was busy cleaning dust off furniture in the buff. She glanced at the man and smirked a little, probably thinking he and Leo did more than such hugging and kissing.<br><br>"I-it's not what you think!" Arnold hurried to explain.<br><br>"Don't worry, sir," she responded, leaning forward and letting him enjoy the view of her slim, athletic body. "Our job is strictly confidential. Call it the janitor-client privilege!"<br><br>"I didn't mean that. I just wanted to say that..." he started speaking, but soon realized it didn't matter and turned his attention to Leo.<br><br>The text on Arnold's laptop seemed large and imposing.<br><br>"Greetings, peoples of Earth!" he started reading aloud. "It is I, Eleonora of Kir'ador. As you may know, we, the people of Sanflaria, decided to give you an insight into our rich and varied culture by producing a documentary with several of your prominent moneymakers. We will show you a reality that you didn't dare to even dream of and allow you to feel a part of our magnificent world that'll leave you begging for more. It's in your best interest to invest your finances into this venture, for this documentary may build a bridge between our worlds that you and your descendants will walk on in the coming decades!"<br><br>He fell silent, unsure what to say.<br><br>"So how is that?" Leo said with a confident smirk.<br><br>"Well, the bridge metaphor was nice."<br><br>"And that's it?!" the countess pouted.<br><br>Arnold tried to soften his criticism as much as possible, but it still made Leo scoff at the Earthians' entitlement. Basically, he explained that people wouldn't want to be degraded in the advertisement, or even told the truth really. They'd wish to feel special, important, and rewarded for their actions, especially if those involved spending money on something.<br><br>"So, uh, you want me to lie?"<br><br>"Here on Earth we call this marketing," Arnold clarified.<br><br>Leo pouted again but ended up accepting his offer. After all, she asked him for an Earthian perspective, and if that's what it was, she had to edit her text accordingly. The ending result was much better: Leo and Lala talked about how excited they were to be on Earth, how they wanted to launch a cultural exchange between their nations, and how thankful they are for locals ogling their bodies.<br><br>That last part might've been Arnold's hormones talking again, but it'd probably resonate with their male audience the most, so they left it in. Soon, the donation page was live, and Leo called all of her Earthian contacts to help spread it. She even shared it with her friends Ximena and Captain Davis, wondering how they'd been in the past month and how much their wardrobe had decreased from their latest meeting.<br><br>Davis seemed busy since she didn't even read Leo's messages. Ximena, on the other hand, replied right away. The cheerful exhibitionist promised to link the page whenever she can and even said something about asking her faculty for help. After all, she was a culturologist, so this task was right up her alley.<br><br>The delegation went about their business and soon saw the donation bar at the bottom of the page fill up so quickly you'd think somebody donated every second! Both Leo and Arnold could feel their work will pay off, which only left Mr. Luxe to worry about now. However, this part was also a bit problematic, as neither Araman nor ICA managed to contact the man in more than a day.<br><br>Thankfully, he soon announced his presence himself by a phone call and made it clear why he ignored previous attempts at communication: he was only interested in speaking directly to Eleonora.` },
      { title: "Chapter 8", summary: "The naked countess meets with an interested party.", content: `Luxurious Return<br><br>The orange van stopped near a pedestrian street. Its door slid open, revealing a busy road lined with shops and bars. The sun had already set, but streetlights filled the evening with shining and made it almost as bright as day. Leo was all for it, looking forward to basking in the light and the passersby's gazes. Araman shook his head, still against this idea.<br><br>But that was Mr. Luxe's demand: Leo had to meet him and go with him to the local bar alone, with neither ICA staff nor other Sanflarians nearby. Of course, Arnold's higher-ups still planned to keep several agents at the ready, and Luxe should've known this, so there'd be a response if things went wrong. Still, the investor was very insistent that nobody else "interrupts" their lovely meeting.<br><br>"We can come there together and tell him we won't be doing it his way," Araman spoke while Lala gave Leo a hug and wished her luck.<br><br>"Please, baron. I can take care of myself! The man just wants to feel special for being in the company of a beautiful, naked woman. We can't deny him that," she smiled in response.<br><br>Before more arguing could take place, Leo swiftly stepped out of the car and blew her friends an air kiss, already feeling several gazes landing on her nude figure. The pavement wasn't as warm anymore. Instead it gave the girl's feet a cool sensation. She walked forward with her head held high, her steps slow and graceful, while waving and smiling at the surrounding folks. Even asked for directions from a group of people, even though she knew where that bar was located.<br><br>People around her were confused, as without her entourage, Leo didn't look like a Sanflarian countess. She was just a butt-naked girl in the middle of the street, possibly an exhibitionist due to her playful smirk. Some looked for a camera behind her, others asked whether it was a dare, but most just enjoyed the moment.<br><br>Sure, there were some critics, but the majority was completely fine with Leo being herself in public. After all, it was just a human body with no attached implications. Yet another proof that for Earthians, a CMNF lifestyle could be accepted if they dared to drop the chains of their outdated beliefs and prejudice. When she meets Luxe, she'll be sure to mention it during their conversation.<br><br>Interestingly enough, Leo was actually intrigued to meet the man. That call made him seem powerful and mysterious, though he didn't sound fully confident when asking Leo to come alone. Also, she could swear she already heard this voice somewhere before, and it clearly was on Earth. But where? Suddenly, Leo noticed a tuxedo-clad figure waving at her and realized she'll find out very soon.<br><br>"Hello, my dear countess. I'm happy to see you again," the figure said as it stepped out from the darkness.<br><br>It was a dark-haired, tall man with a look of anticipation in his dark eyes. He must've been in his late twenties and took good care of his health, judging by his smooth skin and athletic physique. Leo recognized him after a moment, even though their previous meeting was very brief. It was Roy, one of the rich bankers she met at Omnia during her previous visit.<br><br>"Shall we introduce each other again?" the blonde jested. "I'm Eleonora of Kir'ador, pleased to meet you."<br><br>"I'm Elroy Luxe, but you can call me Roy, Lady Eleonora," he replied in a pleasant voice.<br><br>"Didn't know you were a multimillionaire! I knew bankers earned a lot in your words, but this much? Not bad."<br><br>Roy let out a laugh.<br><br>"Thank you. That's true, my business has been booming in the past month, and I figured I could spare some cash on the thing I love the most: naked women. So what will you say? Shall we go inside? I'm sure we'll have plenty of time to discuss anything you want over a glass of wine. Or two."<br><br>"You're straight to the point, aren't you?" Leo landed her hands on her hips, showing Roy that she wasn't going to back down from his pressure. "Alright, let it be so. Lead me, old friend, but that vintage better be good, or there'll be no deal between us!"<br><br>"Sure, sure, only the best, just as you like," he carefully enveloped his hand around Leo's waist and walked with her to a fancy, exclusive bar. <br><br>The staff greeted the two with smiles and politeness. That said, Leo still could tell the male half was gawking at her figure while the female one silently scoffed at her lack of shame. The same was with other formally dressed patrons, who looked at the couple with grins, sometimes commending Roy's choice and complimenting Leo's beauty. The two sat and began ordering their drinks, Roy with a smug look on his face. He clearly felt like a winner right now.<br><br>The place was quite nice. Dim lights created a warm atmosphere; the tables and counter were elegantly stylish, and the seats covered with red velvet were especially nice for Leo's noble rear. While some people looked like they wished to be in Leo's company as well, they didn't dare to interrupt her and Roy's talks, so the two were left alone very soon. They clinked their glasses, toasting to pleasant cooperation, and the words began flowing along with fine wines.<br><br>Leo told Roy everything she told her previous investors. About the social shift, opportunities for the future, and, of course, the market for Sanflarian culture, since she remembered that Mr. Luxe only cared about money. This time, however, he was much nicer and showed interest in Leo's homeland, culture, and traditions far more than in Omnia. It was even a bit suspicious, but Leo made sure to capitalize on all those topics as much as she could.<br><br>Soon, the couple became tipsy since the fancy cheeses they ate couldn't fully counter the alcohol. Their business-like conversation turned casual, and they started to have more and more laughs. Luxe also became bolder as the time went on: while he let Leo sit beside him on her own at first, soon he landed his hand on her shoulder, then slid it down all the way to her backside and started giving her gentle slaps in response to some of her witty remarks.<br><br>Of course, Leo wasn't shy to provoke the man herself. The countess caressed Roy's knee with her hand and gave him hugs whenever he was agreeing with her, making sure her round boobs were tightly pressed against the fabric of his tuxedo. At one point, Leo even tricked her investor by telling him to grab the bottle from her and moving her away so that his palm landed right on her breast. Roy took this as a sign and didn't hesitate to escalate further, fondling and squeezing Leo's tits beyond any lines. Sure enough, after that the dialogue quickly became even friendlier.<br><br>"Oh wait, that's not very comfortable," Leo suddenly said, making Roy remove his hands in embarrassment.<br><br>"Apologies, I thought you enjoyed our... close communication."<br><br>"I didn't mean that! It's just a bit limiting when we both have to lean to the side so much," the blonde explained. "Actually, I have an idea!"<br><br>With these words, Leo stood up, then landed her butt right on Roy's lap and enveloped her arms around his shoulders.<br><br>"Wow, just like in Omnia," he commented.<br><br>"Sure, I thought it'd add a pleasant nostalgic beat to our evening. So, wanna talk about the documentary's key themes?"<br><br>The man nodded, and the two continued, Leo pushing her agenda further with each word. Roy kept agreeing to everything as they exchanged touches and fed each other cheese slices; it seemed almost too easy. However, soon Luxe asked for something in return: he confessed wanting to do something very playful with Leo when they first met but didn't have enough time.<br><br>"There's an interesting tradition of our own that you might find very exciting," he said with a mysterious grin.<br><br>"Then tell me, and we shall see!" Leo demanded, poking his nose.<br><br>"You have a very beautiful navel," Roy said, making the countess chuckle.<br><br>"Huh, thanks. I can't say I heard that part of my body being praised very often. What's it about?"<br><br>Luxe answered with a picture that made Leo bite her lip in excitement. It was a beautiful, young woman. She was lying on a bar counter completely naked with some sort of liquid within her navel and small hills of salt covering both her nipples. She also held a thin slice of lemon in her mouth, trying her best not to smile so it wouldn't fall out. This pose made her look like she was part of that place's menu, a living serving of drinks with a beautiful body as a decoration.<br><br>Some women would see it as a reckless bimbo being humiliated and objectified in public. Leo saw it as a confident and understanding woman letting men get what they wanted and enjoying herself in the process. She looked back at Roy but didn't need him to say what he wanted out loud. Without any further phrases, Leo stood up and began climbing to the counter while the wide-eyed staff ogled her body from this new, unique angle.<br><br>Whispers and giggles echoed throughout the room as the countess lay down flat on her back, her bare front now visible to the entire bar. Roy smirked as he saw several patrons approaching them with their cameras, each eager to take a part in this magnificent presentation. After all necessary instructions, the bartender poured some whiskey into Leo's navel, then sprinkled one of her breasts with salt and gave her a piece of lemon to hold with her teeth. The countess giggled in pleasure as she saw multiple patrons filming and discussing her naked body.<br><br>"Must be a special night for you two," an old lady chuckled.<br><br>"I wonder how much he paid her," asked her husband, his question being both wrong and right at the same time.<br><br>Leo couldn't help but smile. Oddly enough, she didn't ever feel so naked at home like she did here. Maybe it was because we learn everything through comparison, but what seemed like a mundane part of life on Sanflaria seemed like an act of bravery now. A liberating and emboldening act, one that made her feel truly herself even amidst criticism and opposition.<br><br>And just looking at the faces around her was enough to understand that locals partook in this feeling as well, amazed by her self-expression. All of that made Leo feel butterflies in her stomach, a sensation she liked so much the first time at Omnia but nearly forgot after getting back home. Maybe it was similar to what those NIP models felt as they walked in the streets in the buff.<br><br>Though their experiences with nudity were vastly different, there was still something in common between them--they were human females, so showing off and being admired was part of their nature, even if for some of them it was a deeply hidden desire.<br><br>Meanwhile, Roy slowly leaned to his naked business partner and drank the whiskey, making her giggle a bit. Then, he neared her nipples, savoring each moment. His tongue landed on Leo's pink peak and slowly licked off all the salt. The sensation on Leo's breast caused her to giggle even more, but Mr. Luxe wasn't done yet.<br><br>He grimaced and pointed at the salt again, silently telling the bartender it wasn't enough. The man smiled and poured some onto Leo's other nipple. Instead of licking it off, however, Roy enveloped the countess' breast with his lips and practically sucked the salt from it. Leo let out a quiet moan as she felt her nipples getting hard while the crowd cheered her friend on. Finally, Roy got close to Leo's face and put his sights on the lemon slice.<br><br>A playful daringness overtook Leo's mind as their little game went on. Instead of giving the fruit to Roy, she held her teeth tightly shut and forced him to come even closer. He grabbed with his teeth once more, then gave up and turned this into a hot, passionate kiss. As their lips intertwined, he removed the lemon and ate it with a victor's grin.<br><br>Leo bit her lip and conceded as the storm of pleasure and horniness raged inside of her, whipped up by the alcohol. She started to get up, but Luxe leaned over and kissed her again, much to their audience's awe. Leo replied in kind, pulling him closer by his tie. This man surely was better than she remembered. After their hot exchange, the two thanked the bartender and left, holding each other in their arms.<br><br>While she didn't expect Roy to go this far at first, she didn't mind as he did it with class. To the contrary, there was part of her that was disappointed he didn't get bold enough to sprinkle salt on her pussy as well.<br><br>"Well, that was one hell of a tradition. Makes me want to learn more about your culture already!" Leo exclaimed jokingly as they strolled down the street.<br><br>People stared at them like they were celebrities, but neither of the two seemed to notice, too busy enjoying each other's company. Of course, they didn't want their evening to stop there, especially since they were both pretty drunk. Instead, Roy decided to drive Leo to a place that was a personal favorite of his even though it was far less snobby. "For the common folk," the way Luxe put it.<br><br>"Shouldn't you be sober to drive those smelly containers of yours?" Leo asked with responsibility.<br><br>"Don't sweat it, dear. I have my own driver!"<br><br>"Good, because I'm sure those cops over there wouldn't have liked seeing you at the wheel!" the countess pointed at two police cars standing on the other side of the street.<br><br>Roy's expression suddenly changed, though he tried to hide it. His breathing got hectic for a moment, after which he hurried to get Leo to the car and gave her a goofy smile that wasn't common for him before. The countess tried asking what was wrong, but he waved it off and changed topics. Leo followed along without thinking about it too much. With no Araman or Arnold around, there was not enough cool-headed judgment or anxiety to make her choose otherwise.<br><br>She noted the cars following them at a distance, with their sirens off, as Roy's nice Porsche rode towards the club. It wasn't that odd: ICA probably mobilized all forces to make sure the Sanflarian delegation was safe, and they were monitoring the situation, whether the delegates themselves liked it or not.<br><br>***<br><br>This bar was a stark contrast to the quiet, luxurious place Roy and Leo just left. The furniture looked cheap, and the dÃ©cor was seemingly aimed more at the working class than the elite. It was filled with noise, loud music, and the stench of cigarettes. But also a lively atmosphere of pure fun that the countess picked up on right away--her being drunk must've helped with that.<br><br>The security at the entrance let Leo and Roy in without any questions. One of them just said the blonde should be careful.<br><br>"Some of our patrons won't skip a chance to get a closer look at a bod like that. I hope you can handle their pressure," he elaborated.<br><br>"Ha! You'd better be worried if they can handle mine!" Leo slapped her butt and walked forwards, her feminine hips swaying from side to side and causing the guards to smile.<br><br>The sea of dancing people parted like water in front of Moses as the countess walked through the building, most standing in awe and disbelief at this marvelous sight. People here were also different, catcalling and cheering her on in their drunken boldness. Leo and Roy didn't waste time since the music already got into their bones. They quickly stepped into the very middle of the improvised dance floor and began moving to the beat, still holding each other.<br><br>It was actually just space between tables since the place didn't seem to have an actual dance floor. There was some sort of a stage to the left, but it was blocked off by three strings which must've meant that it was unavailable. The couple started relatively tame, but soon began to tear up the floor like there was no tomorrow. Leo energetically moved her hips and jumped up and down, letting the melody consume her whole.<br><br>Her tits and buttocks were jiggling with each move, her golden mane was jumping in all directions, and her skin quickly began glistening with sweat. She was all for it and didn't hold anything back, as if aiming to provoke the dancers more and more with her sexy attitude.<br><br>Finally, her attention slipped from Roy and landed on other folks around her, who were happy to take the noble beauty for a spin or two. Luxe was okay without it. Seeing Leo having fun in the center of attention brought him too much joy to become jealous. Even while people started groping her large, alluring tits and enveloping their hands around her form, he didn't mind, only partook in it himself and gave Leo a pleasant fondling.<br><br>He didn't go too out of line, but when he leaned closer, the blonde smirked as she felt his rock-hard boner. And, judging by other men's looks, Roy wasn't the only one. Everyone around Leo could tell that she was going wild tonight, and there was no stopping her anymore.<br><br>But even that wasn't enough for the drunk, horny countess. When she and her companion went for yet another drink, she had an amazing idea. Before the bartender could even tell her that all drinks were on the house, Leo sat on the counter and began climbing up. This time, however, she didn't lie on it but placed her bare feet on the wood and stood upright, her naked figure towering above everyone around her.<br><br>"Hell yeah, show us all you got!" someone from the crowd shouted, clearly expressing the majority's opinions.<br><br>Leo blew an air kiss with both hands and continued swaying her hips to the rhythm, her body completely visible to the entire crowd with no one to block it. The audience supported her by whistling and wooing that nearly broke through the blaring music. Leo felt every bit of their excitement as she kept her shameless dance, her moves now combining the shamelessness of Earthian nightclubs and the grace of Sanflarian dances.<br><br>The atmosphere reminded Leo of the Bonfire Week celebrations in her dear Kir'ador, where women danced wildly under the night sky, surrounded by flames and adoration of their men.<br><br>The phone cameras started clicking all around her, to which Leo posed by bending and assuming indecent poses. Her breasts, her butt, her shaven pussy--the entirety of her naked image was recorded and would soon flood the internet, free for any Earthian to see. If that wasn't a promotion, she didn't know what else it could be.<br><br>"That's what mixing business with pleasure actually looks like!" she yelled and suddenly got an all fours. Her ass started to shake wildly to the rhythm as the crowd roared behind her.<br><br>Roy was sitting at the counter right below her and enjoying his front-row seat, but then had to step away as he received a call. As soon as he saw the number, his face changed just like back then, when they left the first bar. Leo noticed him hurrying to explain something, sighing, and even yelling in the distance, but didn't pay it too much mind. She heard that making money could be very stressful here on Earth, even for the richer folks.<br><br>When he came back, Leo had already stopped dancing and simply sat on the counter with her legs spread, trying to catch her breath after her wild show. Suddenly, the music changed, and the lighting became even dimmer, with a couple of spotlights pointing at the stage in the bar's center. The patrons reacted immediately, some turning away from the naked girl and others wooing even louder.<br><br>"Oh, nice. We've got here just in time for the show!" Roy said with excitement as if the call didn't even happen.<br><br>"The show?"<br><br>"Yes. Dancing and booze aren't why this place is my favorite, you know. I think you'll enjoy what's about to happen next!"<br><br>Leo looked at the stage in anticipation as it got surrounded by the patrons. Suddenly, one more spotlight appeared, pointing at the door connected to the stage. A muscular, shapely woman clad in only a green string bikini entered the stage and began waving to the crowd. She had short, dark hair, an athletic physique, and a gaze that looked like it could kill someone.<br><br>Someone's voice echoed through the building, announcing the girl as "Dora the Destroyer" and saying that today she'll be facing an opponent never before seen in this arena. Then Leo suddenly realized that it wasn't just a bar, and the stage wasn't the kind she thought at first. It was meant for fighting, and Dora was about to put it to good use.<br><br>"This is a ring, a common thing for any combat sports. Don't you have those on Sanflaria?" Roy asked, a bit confused.<br><br>"If this is a ring, why isn't it round? I didn't even recognize it at first," Leo raised her eyebrow. "How is it logical to call it that if it's a square?"<br><br>Roy turned to thinking but didn't find words to reply with.<br><br>"And her opponent: the master of charms and the wildest girl in her coven--Black the Witch!"<br><br>A tall brunette with long hair and an alluring hourglass figure ascended to the ring, wearing a coat and a pointy hat. After a second, she ditched both of those items and revealed a suggestive V-shaped mankini below. The girls stood on opposite sides of the square, eyeing each other with mischievous contempt. Leo also noticed that their bodies were almost shining under the spotlight--must've been body oil.<br><br>The fighters glanced at the naked countess sitting atop the counter and exchanged giggling whispers. Their friendly attitude didn't last long as the show had to start. Dora and Black exchanged stereotypical insults with the crowd gasping at each one, gave each other a slap, and began wrestling. The crowd raged on as the girls' glistening bodies met in a violent yet sexy clash.<br><br>Dora started with an armdrag and dropped Black flat on her butt. Yet the "witch" hit her on the leg and caught her in the chokehold before she could capitalize, taking back the initiative. They writhed and turned in each other's arms yet sometimes slipped out of each other's holds due to how oily their bodies were.<br><br>Dora was the strong type and could suplex or bodyslam Black with ease. The witch, on the other hand, preferred speed and agility. The crowd wooed after each move, but athletic feats weren't the ones that impressed them the most. They were more interested in alluring moves, like one girl pulling on another's straps so much that they could almost see the victim's pussy or "accidentally" causing her to expose her titties to the crowd.<br><br>It culminated when Dora removed the top of Black's mankini from her shoulders, causing the brunette's breasts to fall out for a moment. The audience roared in excitement, and it only rose when Black retaliated by tearing Dora's top clean off. The strongwoman had good-looking breasts, at least Cs; not even her muscular physique could distract people from their feminine appeal.<br><br>Meanwhile, Leo kept sitting on the counter and got caressed by multiple males' hands, which created a sexy sideshow for everyone around her. That said, she wasn't focused on her own position right now. Instead, she shouted advice and commands to the wrestlers, guided by her experience as a windstriker.<br><br>"Pull her leg higher! Yeah, that like! Wait, no, turn around. What are you doing?!" the blonde yelled again and again, clearly unimpressed by the girls.<br><br>Finally, Dora and Black had enough and stopped fighting. Their eyes locked on Leo's naked body, and they approached the edge of the ring in unison.<br><br>"Wow, that nudist's gonna get it," someone whispered in the crowd.<br><br>"Hey, bare ass! You have a problem with how we handle our business, huh?" Dora yelled, her tits jumping from the sudden move.<br><br>"Did nobody tell you it's bad to get involved in others' conflicts? Or they might suddenly involve you as well," Black added with a self-assured grin.<br><br>"I was just saying that you two could be fighting a lot better. What, you think improving your combat style would be too hard?" Leo said calmly, but the crowd reacted to her words the loudest.<br><br>Dora and Black were at a loss for a moment, then retaliated with more insults. Of course, Leo wasn't going to back down and approached the ring while berating their moves and explaining how easy it would be to counter them. Finally, both sides realized there was only one way to settle this.<br><br>"If you're so strong, bare ass, then why don't you come up here and prove it? I'm sure you can take on both of us at the same time if you're as good as you say!"<br><br>Patrons erupted in cheers, which told Leo exactly what she should've done. As a proud Sanflarian, she wouldn't back down from a fight. Especially one that promised to be so easy and fun.<br><br>"I hope you're ready to see an actual warrior in action!" Leo said as she jumped over the ropes right onto the ring, surrounded by the crowd's applause.<br><br>Meanwhile, Roy was looking somewhere else, even though he clearly wanted to enjoy the blonde's performance to the fullest. Nevertheless, his gaze was focused on one of the windows where he could see one of the police cars from earlier neatly parked in an alleyway. He wanted to call Leo at first, but instead let out a sigh and turned his attention to the ring as if nothing happened.` },
      { title: "Chapter 9", summary: "The naked countess fights for her pride and glory.", content: `Twisted Hand of Law<br><br>The body oil gradually enveloped Leo's naked form in its sticky embrace and made her skin shine in the spotlight. Roy was her main "assistant", spreading the liquid throughout the countess' body but mostly concentrating on her privates (if one could even call them that considering Leo's lack of clothing) squeezing and rubbing them like they were lovers in bed. However, a couple of other men also managed to sneak their palms in and now slowly caressed the girl's curves while she stood there and savored every second of this moment.<br><br>Her nipples were hard, and her pussy was getting wet not only because of oil, yet she kept her concentration and gazed at the fighters in the opposing corner.<br><br>"Hey, why are you taking so long? Afraid of us?" Dora grinned from ear to ear.<br><br>"No, I'm just thinking what could I teach you rookies while I kick your asses until they're red," Leo parried. "I think I'd start by pointing out those hideous pieces of fabric you wear."<br><br>Dora and Black simultaneously furrowed their brows at this insult, but Leo continued:<br><br>"They aren't practical and only weigh you down by putting pressure on your skin... just like any clothes would do to a woman. Am I right?"<br><br>The crowd applauded in response.<br><br>"Amazing," Roy said. "You've been here for only an hour and already managed to turn the crowd against their main faces."<br><br>"That's called charisma, honey," Leo blew him a kiss, then continued berating the wrestlers:<br><br>"Moreover, these loincloths of yours provide a disadvantage as somebody (probably me) might (probably will) pull at them and limit your movements at some point (probably during our fight). So my first advice would be to take them off and fight me like a woman with self-respect would--naked!"<br><br>The crowd erupted in their loudest cheering yet while Dora and Black stood silent for a moment.<br><br>"Hm, well played. Let's make this a show they won't forget!" Black said and began pulling off her mankini while Dora untied her tongue.<br><br>Soon, the two stood in front of Leo in their birthday suits, their taut backsides and glistening pussies free for everybody to look at.<br><br>"Now that's our style. Let's see if you can back it up in combat!" Leo grinned like a maniac and assumed her offensive stance, taking a large step closer.<br><br>Both Dora and Black suddenly stepped back. A shadow of doubt appeared on their faces. Maybe they underestimated this mysterious nudist after all.<br><br>However, the fight had started before they could change their decision. Leo charged immediately, though the two were lucky to dodge the first blow by jumping in opposite directions. Dora, being the strongwoman, counterattacked first but paid for it dearly: the countess quickly bent her arm behind her back and made her fall with a leg sweep.<br><br>The witch appeared from behind and tried choking Leo out, but the blonde managed to hit her with her taut ass and threw the opponent over her shoulder with a powerful armdrag. The countess thought she was winning, but fighting two opponents at once distracted her, and Dora was able to capitalize by kneeing her right in the vulva. The blonde gasped in pain, and the crowd reacted by ouching in unison.<br><br>Body oil helped her to slip free from Dora's next hold as their bodies rubbed against each other in sexy chaos. The strongwoman made a wrong move and got hit by Leo's pussy right in the face, after which the blonde locked her head between her thighs. While it could've seemed like a dream to some, Dora cried for help, feeling that she might suffocate at any moment.<br><br>Black came to her aid by pulling Leo's hair and hitting her against the mat. The two worked together and managed to limit her movements by landing atop her for a second.<br><br>"That's right, bitch!" Dora's voice echoed throughout the building. "We'll make you eat our asses after this!"<br><br>At this point, Leo realized she probably shouldn't have told them how to effectively counter wrestling moves before their fight. Would her hubris be her downfall? Maybe, but not this time, as she was still a lot stronger than two wannabe sportswomen.<br><br>"For the windstriking school!" she shouted so loudly her opponents twitched, yet it was only the beginning.<br><br>With a furious battle cry, Leo caught Dora's head and turned the strongwoman around, hitting her against the ring and landing on top of her. Then she used Black's weight against her and made the witch fall down right on top of her buddy. Before they could react, Leo masterfully tied their arms together and applied a painful hold that made both of them cry out like banshees.<br><br>Their first instinct was to break free, but they quickly realized any movement made the pain ten times worse. Neither of the wrestlers has ever seen something like this. They were guaranteed to remember the word "windstriking" for the rest of their lives.<br><br>"I give, I give, please, stop!" Dora pleaded with tears in her eyes.<br><br>"Y-yes, stop... if you don't, I'm gonna cum!" Black yelled, to which both her friend and Leo reacted with surprise.<br><br>"W-what? Damn, it's too late!" the witch said right before releasing a loud moan of pure pleasure.<br><br>"Uh, so that's why you're into this sport, huh?" Leo began spanking the orgasming girl, enjoying her yelling.<br><br>The crowd was on their feet, including Roy, who looked at the countess with a lovestruck expression. As the blonde got up, the announcer came to the ring and showered her with champagne, which she didn't even bother drinking, instead letting it spill all over her and drip down all the way to her pussy. If there was ever an image that should've been used for a combat sports recruitment, this was it.<br><br>***<br><br>Leo and Roy walked on the dark street like they owned the entire city, even though both were staggering and stumbling over each other due to the tiredness and alcohol kicking in.<br><br>"You're a goddess, Leo!" Roy spoke in delight.<br><br>"Alright, alright, no need to get blasphemous." Leo jokingly pressed her finger to the man's lips, and they both chuckled.<br><br>"I just can't fathom why those Textilians are so mad at you," he said, then suddenly shut up as if he didn't mean to mention it.<br><br>Leo scoffed. Indeed, she couldn't understand why he'd remember them in such a nice moment.<br><br>"Textilians are fools. They think that clothing makes a woman respectable and keeps sexual desires away. If you ask me, it actually does the opposite! Our men never ogle our bodies like you do because they're a normal part of life to them, just like our hair or faces. Plus, it teaches them to treat women based on their character, not on how much fabric they put on themselves. We have female priests, teachers, scientists, even soldiers, and no one thinks they're sluts only because they're naked!"<br><br>Roy could only nod after this drunk yet very elaborate speech. Still, something seemed to bother him, like a lingering thought kept popping up in his brain. He kept looking away at an alleyway near them with a heavy gaze.<br><br>"What's wrong? You can tell me, you know," Leo looked at him and smiled. "It's been a very nice evening, you've been good to me, and I'd like to repay you in kind."<br><br>Her stern face suddenly changed into a kind and caring one. Roy was taken aback by this sudden transformation. He stuttered for the first time before finally delivering his confession:<br><br>"I just... I... I just wanted to kiss you! I love you, Leo, ever since that night at Omnia!"<br><br>Now it was her turn to be left speechless in surprise. But before she could even ask whether it was too fast since Sanflarians considered love a very important concept, she felt Roy's lips on her own. If she'd been sober, she'd probably stop him right there, but now was such a great moment that spoiling it felt like a crime. The joy of drinking, flirting, and fighting all blended into one sexual cocktail that now boiled within her, ready to burst out at any moment. And thus, Leo followed her instincts, like she always did.<br><br>In the very next second, the two were already making out in an alleyway with Leo's back leaning against the cold bricks. She didn't feel them, though, too busy with her tongue moving inside Roy's mouth. The banker's hand traveled across Leo's body and finally landed directly atop her pussy. Leo only supported his bold approach and spread her bare legs wider. She was ready, even eager to feel him inside of her.<br><br>"Huh, do all dates on Earth end up like this?" she said as they interrupted their kiss, only for their tongues to start mingling again a second later.<br><br>"Far more than you'd think!" Roy slowly lowered his head to the countess' tits and made her moan by sucking and biting one of her rock-hard nipples.<br><br>"Ha! Not bad. But don't you wish to go somewhere more comfortable? Roy?"<br><br>She noticed that something was wrong. Such quick, erratic movements really weren't characteristic of this man. Did the passion take hold of him that fast, or was there something else he was hiding? Suddenly, Leo felt his teeth painfully strike her breast like he was trying to eat it rather than please her.<br><br>"Roy?!" Leo interrupted him and made him stand up straight by grabbing his tie.<br><br>Only now did she notice that the banker was visibly shaken and hyperventilating, like it was him who just got bitten.<br><br>"Is it your first time, or something?" Leo asked with a hint of sympathy.<br><br>"W-what? No!" he defended himself. "I... listen, Leo, I'm very, very sorry. You have to go!"<br><br>"What?!"<br><br>"They'll be here at any moment. I'm sorry, Leo, I'm a moron. I didn't want this to happen!"<br><br>A pair of headlights turned on and filled the dark alleyway with shining.<br><br>"Freeze! You're under arrest!" an authoritarian female voice commanded from the car.<br><br>Leo didn't have time to ask Roy what was happening since her mind got pierced by the loud sound. Then came footsteps and roaring of an engine. Another car appeared right behind the two of them, blocking their only exit from this narrow alleyway. Roy kept apologizing even though Leo couldn't understand why.<br><br>She had bigger things to worry about now: she was surrounded by four police officers with their batons and taser pistols at the ready. All of them were women, tall and athletic ones too, must've been carefully picked for this mission. There was one more who looked like their commander, a short-haired blonde in giant dark sunglasses. She was standing near her car with a pair of handcuffs in her muscular hands.<br><br>"Well, well, well, Ms. Eleonora, it looks like you've finally crossed the line. I'm Officer Angel, ready to take you into custody."<br><br>Leo looked at the policewoman with confusion and asked what was wrong with all of her drunken might. Some of the officers shivered, yet Angel stood firm.<br><br>"As you know, there is no specific law against public nudity in our city. San Francisco is a liberal and open-minded place, but there are limits to everything. You've been trying to have public sex, which is a clear violation of American moral values. You will be brought to the nearest precinct for further questioning."<br><br>Leo's drunk mind didn't understand half of what Angel was saying, but she got the main part: they were trying to arrest her for her free, shameless lifestyle. She was about to ask why the city is so interested in her sex life when she heard a male voice beside her.<br><br>"Please, Leo, run! It's my fault!" Roy cried like a child. "They are a clique of crooked cops who are out to get you. They work with..."<br><br>His voice turned into a shriek, then went silent. Leo barely managed to catch the banker's falling body after Angel shot him with a taser pistol.<br><br>"Jeez, good thing we didn't bring David along. Look what she does to them with that slutty attitude of hers, tsk," the commander clicked her tongue in disgust.<br><br>"What the hell?! Do you bitches know what you just did?" the countess yelled and followed that with a bunch of vile Sanflarian swear words. Nobody could understand her, but everyone felt her fury.<br><br>"Please, Lady Eleonora, you're making it worse," a shy-looking brunette near her said while approaching.<br><br>Angel repeated something about how Leo should come willingly and how she'll be treated fine, but the countess wasn't listening. At that moment, she realized that the fight in the club was merely a warm-up and began looking for possible covers. That taser thing could've really done it if it hit her naked body.<br><br>The cops took another step forward and saw Leo jump behind one of the cars in an instant. A taser shot missed her by mere inches, yet the countess wasn't going to cover and run away. With her muscles heated up by the previous victory and her mind sobering up from shock and anger, she was ready to fight.<br><br>"Get over here, that's an order!" a middle-aged policewoman with red hair lunged right at her only to get hit against her car's hood and land in Leo's hold.<br><br>Her friends tried freeing her, but the countess ducked at the right moment and made two of them fall on top of each other with a sweep, winning a couple of seconds. The redhead kept trying to hit her, so she did what she always did to female opponents: began stripping her. The top half of her uniform got removed with a loud ripping sound and now covered her face, blocking her sight.<br><br>Her bra went the same way and revealed her large yet saggy tits. The woman kept swaying her baton around with her bare tits now jumping in all directions, yet still couldn't reach Leo. Instead, she hit one of her own colleagues while the countess evaded another officer's strikes. The victim of friendly fire dropped to the ground while Leo, sensing opportunity, kicked the redhead right into the window of her own car.<br><br>"Whew, it seems like you need more training. Both your tits and your skills would be better if you led a healthier life, darling!" with those words, the countess leaned forward and pulled off the middle-aged woman's pants, leaving her with only shoes on.<br><br>A Hispanic policewoman who got hit by a baton started rising up, only for Leo to grab her and disappear behind the car with her after a couple of stiff knees to her face.<br><br>"Use tasers, damnit!" Angel screamed at her subordinates, who clearly struggled more than she expected.<br><br>Leo noticed one of them--a slim, flat-chested brunette--charging her taser in an instant. As soon as she poked out her head, the pistol fired. But the countess was ready and shoved the Hispanic woman right into the taser's trajectory. A short scream escaped her mouth before she collapsed, leaving only three officers standing. The remaining ones shockingly remarked that the colleague they just hit was completely naked.<br><br>"It's only been a couple of seconds! How did she strip her already?!" Angel said with fear.<br><br>The brunette realized she had to change the tactic and charged at Leo with her baton. The blonde evaded and got behind the girl. She was about to turn around but felt a weird sensation below her waist. Leo used the moment of hesitation to slide down her pants along with her panties, leaving the brunette's pale backside completely exposed.<br><br>The blonde gave her an elbow before she could react and sent her flying into the nearby trashcans. Sure enough, she tripped and ended up with her upper body atop one of them, dropping her baton in the process. Leo removed her pants right away, leaving the girl completely bottomless, then grabbed her baton.<br><br>"W-what are you doing? No, wait, you  can't..." her words turned into a scream of pain as her own weapon landed on her pussy with a powerful blow.<br><br>Angel watched in horror as she watched this scene unfold. Another ripping sound echoed through the alleyway, and the rest of the girl's uniform went into the nearby dumpster. Three of Angel's minions were now defeated, beaten up, and naked. She carefully observed the scene to find her last subordinate, a busty and beautiful blonde who was shaking in fear.<br><br>"What the hell are you waiting for? Use your taser! Strike her with a baton! Do something!"<br><br>The beauty froze in terror. However, when Leo turned her gaze to her, she suddenly came to her senses and... began undressing. Angel screamed at her while she removed her uniform, freed her giant boobs from her bra, slid her panties down her legs, and even took off her boots before throwing them all in the garbage along with her equipment.<br><br>"P-please, don't hurt me!" the busty blonde said while Leo admired her body.<br><br>"Wow. How could such beauty fall to such terrible deeds?" the countess shook her hand while the busty girl's eyes began watering.<br><br>"Oh, don't cry, you're a good girl. I won't hurt you. Calm down. Just turn around."<br><br>The beauty turned around and heard a clasp behind her back: Leo just handcuffed her.<br><br>"Now run as far as you can and show everyone your beauty. Go!"<br><br>A loud buttslap was enough to send the beautiful policewoman running away like a prey from a hunting dog. The involuntary streaker unknowingly went into the most crowded part of the district with whistles and woos following her giant, jiggling tits through the night. There was grunting and an engine roar behind Leo's back. She turned around and saw the police car backing away from the alley.<br><br>"You didn't pay us enough for this!!!" Angel yelled to someone behind her.<br><br>Leo was about to jump on the hood, but that detail distracted her and she focused her gaze in that direction. There was a slim, dark-haired girl clad in a sundress. A faint look on her face was enough to recognize her, especially since she wore the same terrified expression as last time. It was one of the Textilians Leo stripped naked for everybody to enjoy, and it seemed like now was a good moment to repeat that experience.<br><br>Unfortunately, before the blonde could reach the girl, she ran away. Just like Angel, who left in her patrol car, leaving all of her naked, beaten friends behind. The alley was silent again. Well, almost silent, safe for all the grunting of the stripped cops. Leo turned around, staggered a little and assumed her victorious pose. Then, she bent over and threw up. All that jumping and kicking after that much booze couldn't have been good for her.<br><br>Some of it got on Roy's jacket and, as if sensing his money being wasted on dry cleaning in the future, he opened his eyes.<br><br>"Ugh man, not cool! Who the hell does this?" he said, still in delirium.<br><br>"You deserved that, traitor!" Leo replied with a stern gaze.<br><br>Suddenly, Roy opened his eyes fully and the countess saw them fill with immesuarable guilt.<br><br>"Leo... I'm so sorry. What... what happened?"<br><br>"What happened is I beat up all of your friends who tried to set me up for a public sex charge."<br><br>Roy started muttering something under his breath, but Leo stood above him and landed her bare feet right on his crotch. He fell silent as sharp pain pierced his entire manhood, reducing his voice to mere squeaking. Leo pressed her foot even stronger to see the suffering on Roy's face, then finally spoke when he started going pale:<br><br>"Now I'm going to tell you what hasn't happened yet. I haven't deprived your bloodline of future generations and choked you to death for your vile betrayal, but if you're not going to tell me everything from start to finish, this might very well change!"<br><br>"Leo, please, I..." he barely spoke while the immense pain kept spreading throughout his lower body, "alright, I'll tell you everything. But please, listen until the end."<br><br>The blonde nodded and made him speak. He could barely find the right words at first; he just looked at Leo in both fear and adoration. In this mood and from this angle, she was especially beautiful, but this beauty was dangerous and primal. As if Roy was confronted by a wrathful goddess who could destroy him with a single click of her fingers. When he finally collected himself, he was akin to a sinner seeking divine forgiveness.<br><br>"Textilians contacted me soon after I decided to invest in your documentary. Yes, before you ask, it wasn't just a one-and-done protest. They've been hating you ever since that showdown in Nevada and decided that now was the time to act. Elizabeth is a powerful and wealthy woman. I'm not sure what she does for a living, but it's sure as hell profitable. Apparently, they have contacts with corrupt cops who could..."<br><br>Leo pressed him to speak louder as he began to stutter.<br><br>"Listen, it's not my fault! I was naÃ¯ve and foolish! You see, I couldn't get you out of my head after we first met. You dancing there completely naked in public and with such confidence was something I'd never think I'd see with my own eyes. I couldn't forget you. But I couldn't reach you either, so I had to start meeting other girls who were willing to do the same."<br><br>"You stripped other women naked in public?" Leo couldn't contain a brief smile.<br><br>"Well, not by force. They stripped themselves once I gave them an offer. I carefully screened my entire social circle to find those who would like such an experience and contacted them. I bought them things, of course, as I thought it'd show my gratitude. This short period of my life was amazing. But it all ended a week ago, when one of them decided to go to the police."<br><br>"Wait, to the police? But what did you do?"<br><br>"Her friends and family somehow found out about her streaking. Of course, the shame was too much to bear since she was a goody-two-shoes who'd never do this. I think that was part of the appeal for her," he let out a sad laugh.<br><br>"So she blamed you for forcing her, right?" Leo shook her head. "Indeed, women can be bitches sometimes. I would know."<br><br>"Tell me about it! It was a very serious accusation, my whole business could've been ruined. And it's not even that successful to begin with! All that money I got because my rich grandma passed away, and I was her favorite."<br><br>The blonde rolled her eyes, wondering what other parts of Roy's personality were simple lies.<br><br>"Well, that's when Angel and I struck a deal. I don't know how much Textilians paid her, but she said if I could get you drunk and horny and make out with you in public, they could frame it as you having an affair and paint you as a slut... A-a-a!"<br><br>He widely opened his eyes when Leo increased the pressure on his crotch even more.<br><br>"All this just to expose a moment of my weakness to affection? And they dare to call me a pervert!"<br><br>Roy started rapidly agreeing with her, hopeful that he'll still be able to have children after this. Suddenly, Leo released her painful hold and simply stood above him, her golden mane swaying in the wind.<br><br>"I have sympathy for you, but it doesn't mean it absolves you of guilt. You lied to me and were ready to ruin my image just to save yours. What do you think I should do to you now?"<br><br>Roy's eyes began to water as he realized it was his last chance to set things right.<br><br>"P-please, I didn't want to do it. I tried to warn you, remember? Just give me another chance! I'll sign any contract to make sure your documentary gets as much money from me as you want. I'll help however I can. Please, Leo, I still love you. That part was true! I can't live knowing I let you down without making up for it."<br><br>Leo didn't get to respond since she got interrupted by another roaring engine. When the two looked at the nearby street, they saw a familiar orange van with its door sliding open. People poured out of it and reached them in an instant. There were both ICA folks and members of the delegation, all with equally concerned, even fearful expressions. Lala embraced Leo in a tight hug right away, seemingly forgetting about her embarrassment. Arnold ran up to her as well, his voice trembling as he spoke.<br><br>"Leo! Is everything okay?! We were tailing you but lost Roy's car on the way here. What happened?!"<br><br>Leo looked at her companion, whom she considered to be a worthy man mere minutes prior. He sat on the road and looked at the blonde with pleading eyes, silently begging her not to tell the truth. For some reason, Leo believed his intentions. He probably loved her for real, even though he didn't deserve even an inch of her love anymore. Still, him accepting that he was a scumbag and trying to make up for his misdeeds was commendable.<br><br>The countess sighed.<br><br>"Roy and I were attacked by those cops as we were walking back to his porcher, or whatever that loud thing is called. They're working with Textilians. Wanted to book both me and him, but they bit off more than they could chew."<br><br>"I c-can tell," Arnold looked at the whining policewomen and shuddered.<br><br>"Thank you!" Roy suddenly exclaimed and began kissing Leo's feet like a groveling peasant.<br><br>"Wowie, he's really thankful that you saved him!" Lala covered her mouth in surprise.<br><br>"True. And for a good reason," the countess gave the banker an enigmatic wink that only the two of them could understand.` },
      { title: "Chapter 10", summary: "Leo faces the consequences of the previous night.", content: `Facing the Consequences<br><br>Leo grunted as the heavy belt landed on her rear with a loud sound, adding yet another mark to dozens covering both of her buttocks. Despite the countess' whole ass and lower back being completely red already, Araman's firm hand continued to issue hard, painful hits, swinging at full force each time. Nevertheless, Eleonora of Kir'ador endured like a champion, not crying, pleading, or screaming in pain. She simply stood there, bent forward with her legs spread wide and her butt high up, taking the fair punishment.<br><br>Such methods weren't uncommon in Sanflaria, especially for females. Since they felt pain more sharply than men and didn't have access to clothing that could protect them, Sanflarians believed that the best way for them to deal with pain was to be taught how to endure it. And it often meant practicing to face it until it's not an issue for them anymore. A lot of practicing.<br><br>However, today's beating wasn't meant to harden Leo's pain tolerance since she already had that nailed down thanks to her rowdy youth. Instead, its purpose was to teach her a lesson. Mainly, not to sit at bars until she's puking and staggering and not let random Earthians rope her into danger just because she felt horny.<br><br>It wasn't easy. Besides the pain, she also felt immense shame. Not only was she getting spanked like a bratty kid by a lower-ranking noble, but it was also happening right in the hotel's spacious, well-lit lobby with all of the guests gawking at her like she was a BDSM actress!<br><br>Yet, it all made sense to Leo, and the only person she was mad at was herself. In Kir'ador, it was a tradition to inflict some punishments on nobles in public so that they could proudly endure them and show their subjects that they could honestly admit to their mistakes.<br><br>Araman also had a full right to punish Leo since he was leading their delegation and simply carried out her father's will. And, after all, Leo did let herself get carried away yesterday. The beating, the hangover, and the lingering sense of doubt in local men were all the consequences of her own actions.<br><br>"I thought Sanflarian punishments should reflect the crime," Arnold stared from a nearby chair in disbelief.<br><br>"Oh, but this one does!" Lala said cheerfully, and the Sanflarian near her translated with a similar demeanor, "Lord Araman was told that spanking can be, um, a good way to prevent a woman from drinking in taverns since she won't be able to sit there after it happens. And, well, her pussy will ache too much for her to fondly recall the reckless affair she might've had the day before!"<br><br>"You people seem oddly happy about it."<br><br>"Oh, of course I'm not happy about my lady and bestie being in pain!" Lala pouted, then a smile appeared on her lips again. "But I'm glad she's taking it so well. It means she'll endure that punishment with honor and come out a stronger person! Wowie, Lady Eleonora, you go!"<br><br>Arnold shook his head. He had already begun to forget that Sanflarians were an entirely different culture, but this scene quickly returned him to reality. Meanwhile, Leo's suffering was coming to an end, though by her expression it was hard to tell whether she hated it or actually found enjoyment in the pain.<br><br>In fact, it was a bit of both: while this beating made both pairs of her cheeks red, she preferred to see it as a challenge that could help her grow, and that made her accept each strike with dignity. Even gratitude that some could call masochistic. A gasp still escaped her mouth at the last strike, when Baron Araman aimed right at her vulva and hit it at full force from below, nearly making the naked girl jump.<br><br>"And that one is for not listening to my suggestion," he said, recalling the moment where he offered to question Roy from the beginning.<br><br>When he was finally done, a bright smile appeared on Leo's face, and she carefully rubbed her backside with a heavy breath.<br><br>"Thank you, dear baron," the blonde said and kissed the belt with love in her eyes.<br><br>If during the beating someone from the random guests and passersby could speculate that Leo actually liked what was happening, this ending served as concrete proof. Some people in the lobby shook their heads, others smiled along with the brave countess.<br><br>"An honor, my lady," he replied with a bow.<br><br>Their next stop was lunch since Leo slept over the breakfast in her terrible hangover and got quite hungry. She couldn't sit down due to obvious reasons, so the nearby patrons were treated to yet another beautiful sight: while Arnold and the rest of the delegation were eating like normal, Leo just leaned to the table with her legs spread and her red, sore backside in the perfect view of the entire dining area. Despite this, the blonde still followed Sanflarian table manners perfectly, which made everyone around her crack up due to sheer absurdity of the situation.<br><br>Everyone except for Araman, who was lost in his troublesome thoughts.<br><br>"Anything wrong, dear baron?" Leo asked, making sure to keep her tits from falling into her plate.<br><br>"If you'll allow me to voice my own opinion, we need to be more careful from now on." He said somberly, "your decisions are not wrong, my lady, but they are quite rash and can create further issues down the line."<br><br>"Oh, I get it. You've already made your point!" the countess smiled and shook her spanked butt.<br><br>"I don't just mean your last encounter."<br><br>"Huh? What do you mean then?"<br><br>"I mean your attitude towards our issues in general," Araman clarified, clearly forcing himself to talk about this.<br><br>Leo's expression became more serious.<br><br>"I just don't think your approach always works," he continued. "I know your actions come from deep respect for our homeland and our culture, but some Earthians might not see them that way. The fight with Textilians was a scandal, and while many locals support us and call Elizabeth crazy, there's plenty of those who think you started that fight and stripped their female members naked on purpose. That's what Mr. Gelbstein's assistant was so concerned about. It's similar with the cops, although the department did launch a complex internal investigation to fully figure out how many of them are corrupt. In other words, such a direct action may not be good for our cause."<br><br>Arnold sank into his chair when he saw familiar sparks in Leo's eyes. It only took one moment for them to turn into a wildfire and burn down everything around her. However, the countess just took a deep sigh and kept her cool. This time.<br><br>"So you'd want me to just stand there and take it? I'm sorry, but I'm protecting our homeland's pride. Maybe Earthians would be more sympathetic to me if I were weak and got beaten up by both cops and protesters, but that wouldn't be something I could ever feel proud of!" she got up from her leaning position--some patrons audibly sighing with disappointment--and stood upright with her hands crossed under her breasts.<br><br>"I never said that. However, like I mentioned before, it'd be better to avoid such situations in the future."<br><br>"If I did so, I'd never secure Luxe's investment!" Leo raised her voice and caused a rare occurrence: people turning their heads not because of her naked body.<br><br>"And you would've never made the entire ICA work overtime to smooth out the issues with the local police," Araman countered. "Let's just remember that there are two sides to every medal and try looking at it from both directions."<br><br>Leo scoffed at this remark and kept eating her meal in silence. It was obvious the two's differences only grew in the past two days, but they still held together. At least for now. The countess was about to ask Lala for her opinion, but the pink-haired girl dropped a fork and went under the table to find it, narrowly escaping the crowd's gazes once more with her heart racing from embarrassment. Unfortunately for her, Leo started to play around by pulling up the tablecloth and granting the visitors a nice, detailed look at her bestie's bare ass, so all of Lala's attempts to escape the spotlight turned out to be futile.<br><br>Arnold, on the other hand, relayed what his higher-ups told him, which was urging the delegation to lay low for a bit in order to prevent "further violence". He agreed with this statement, at least to an extent. Even if Leo was right and he liked seeing the countess strip other women naked in public, there was no telling how the media could use it against them. After all, they always found a way to turn a situation on its head.<br><br>The next several days passed in questionings, careful decision-making, and boredom. Leo and Lala were advised to stay inside in fear of further problems with Textilians while Araman and ICA talked over the diplomatic side of things. The US officials came to the countess two times, first in the form of local policemen and the second time as two unknown g-men in suits who really wanted to know what exactly transpired on that evening.<br><br>Leo kept her secret about Roy despite their pressure, not wanting that man to end up on another hook despite what he did. It had one significant downside, though: despite the four officers attacking Leo being prosecuted for their corruption, their leader, officer Angel, somehow got away and framed herself as an unknowing accomplice. While she still faced some issues, they were little more than slaps on the wrist, and there was no reason to believe her ties with Lizzie were severed.<br><br>At least Roy was thankful enough to follow through with his promise and signed a contract that pretty much allowed Leo to use all of his savings however she wanted to. Then, there was an email from Charlie, who urged the naked girls to look at their donation page with numerous exclamation points. It turned out it had already collected the needed sum and continued to grow, especially after a video of Leo's naked wrestling match appeared on the internet.<br><br>Soon after that, Mr. Geldstein's assistant confirmed that he was on their side now, which meant that all investors were now in, and the time for their first meeting as partners was fast approaching. Leo couldn't wait since spending all her time in the hotel didn't suit her active lifestyle at all. Of course, it wasn't that bad since this place offered plenty of things to do for a couple of beauties like Leo and Lala.<br><br>They charmed all of the male coaches by exercising naked at the local gym, both with their bodies and their fitness. When Lala reluctantly started her bench pressing routine, most males got scared for her at first but soon felt humiliated by the girl's strength. Women were less enthusiastic about the nudists, especially one influencer who failed to film anyone looking at her during her routine. Still, many of them approached Leo for training advice, as her and Lala's toned bodies and taut butts commanded respect regardless of how one felt about their nudity.<br><br>Then, there were games on the basement floor. Leo had a lot of fun with Arnold teaching her how to play pool and bowling, even though he had very little practice in these sports himself. Even more fun was had by the spectators, who shamelessly ogled the countess' body each time she leaned over a table or went for a strike. Lala, on the other hand, found a convenient way to leave each time the room got too crowded and curled up into a ball in the bathroom, both scared to death of the stares and forcing herself to continue serving her purpose.<br><br>The only activities Lala enjoyed were the ones they could do in the suite with no strangers around. Well, except for the cleaning ladies, but them being naked removed any shame the bodyguard would feel. They even spent some time together after the crew finished their job. Board games were fun but a bit confusing, while the game of Twister they decided to play one time was far more exciting.<br><br>Exciting in more ways than one since the girls felt a wide variety of emotions as their naked, hot bodies were pressed together and got shoved into each other in various poses during the game. One of the cleaners felt it was a bit much and decided to take the host's role while coaxing Arnold into joining the remaining three girls instead and turning this into a full-fledged CMNF fantasy.<br><br>Unfortunately, the agent couldn't keep his cool while the naked gals' breasts and backsides wriggled around him. His rock-hard boner was visible even through his pants, which made him embarrassed and led to loss each time while the girls giggled and made sure to provoke him even more in the name of victory.<br><br>This was a fun and joyful time. However, a watchful eye could've noticed that Lala's mood shifted with each public appearance, her shame and fear gradually overtaking the girl's mind as more people gawked at her naked beauty. Arnold did notice this once but couldn't communicate with Lala well enough due to the language barrier. Leo, on the other hand, denied any possibility that her bestie could feel shame. After all, she knew Lala all her life, and something like this seemed completely out of character. The bodyguard's embarrassment was akin to a bubble confined in her bare, vulnerable form.<br><br>And only one more poke was needed for it to burst.<br><br>It was a sunny day with fragrant trees and flowers calmly swaying in the wind, urging Leo and Lala to come outside for another public nudity stunt. The countess was standing on the suite's balcony with an easel in front of her, painting a peculiar mixture of architecture and nature she saw in front of her.<br><br>As Leo's canvas grew more and more full of vibrant imagery, her movements became faster and more decisive. As if her hand urged to not only capture but feel all those trees and bushes that seemed so close yet out of reach. Finally, she pressed the paintbrush a little too much and left a smudge that didn't fit the elegant nature of the poppy she tried to make.<br><br>"Ugh. I'll turn this one into a dandelion later," she said with an annoyed look. "Lala, we have to go outside!"<br><br>"O-outside?"<br><br>Just a moment ago, Lala was peacefully lying on their bed, adding color and details to the nude sketches Leo made of her, turning them into distinct and creative fantasy characters. Enjoying their shared creativity--even if Lala's share was much smaller--was one of the few things that brought her peace even here. As soon as Leo called out to her, the bodyguard sat up and flinched as if hit by a jolt of electricity.<br><br>"B-but Lord Araman said..." she protested weakly.<br><br>"I know. But what he said was not getting into more trouble, not going under house arrest. Let's just go for a quick walk, nothing bad will happen."<br><br>Lala argued a bit more, but ultimately had to accept her mistress' decision and go to expose herself in public once again with her cheeks already getting red from shame. They snuck out of their room and went straight toward the stairs, realizing they'd cause too much ruckus if they used the glass elevator. It took the Sanflarian duo two minutes of running and shocking the surrounding patrons with their bouncing tits and butts to reach the front exit.<br><br>When Leo felt the light breeze and the sunlight cover her bare, silky skin with no curtains to break their contact, she threw her hands up in a moment of pure joy. Lala walked closely behind, her hands behind her back and her fingers trembling from stress. The two walked a couple of steps, and suddenly the harmony was ruined: there were more than a dozen people waiting for them just outside the hotel.<br><br>"Ms. Eleonora! Ms. Eleonora! Please say a couple of words for our channel!" a middle-aged man rushed to them with a microphone.<br><br>"Ms. Eleonora, do you think you went too far during your fight with the local police?!" a red-haired woman approached them from behind.<br><br>The crowd of journalists and paparazzi was scattered and unnoticeable at first, but they emerged from all corners in seconds like pigeons sensing bread crumbs.<br><br>"No comment! No comment!" Eleonora spread her arms and pushed away some of the people as the crowd began encircling the naked girls. Arnold said that these people will distort whatever she says to them, and she didn't have a reason to not believe that.<br><br>Lala stayed right behind Leo, yet couldn't keep herself from looking around. The people around them turned into one uncontrollable horde, pushing and shoving each other to get a better look. Their eyes were hungry for both their bodies and the information, making the bodyguard feel naked like never before. The cameras clicked away from all sides. Leo reacted by proudly posing for them as she made her way through the crowd while Lala huddled close to her and tried to avoid the stares.<br><br>It seemed like this time, there weren't just regular journalists, but some photographers from adult websites as well. Lala realized then when they started aiming their cameras right at her breasts, backside, and pussy. One of them even tried tripping the girl up for a better angle but quickly paid for his rudeness by falling to the ground after her powerful blow.<br><br>"Alright, alright, you may gawk at our bodies, but not our thoughts. Those are only for the worthy!" Leo laughed as she carelessly strode forward, not even noticing a guy keeping his phone camera right in front of her vulva.<br><br>Lala wished she could do the same, but alas, she was at her limit. Her palms became sweaty and her breathing turned hectic. She was hyperventilating. The lenses were much worse than just stares. They recorded Lala's nudity in detail, keeping it to then spread across the whole web so that anyone, anyone could be able to see the naked girl for years or even decades to come. When the bodyguard looked down at herself, she realized one terrible thing: her hands finally slipped onto her privates, and she was covering herself.<br><br>"No!" Lala yelled and suddenly charged right through the crowd, causing several people to lose their footing and fall onto each other.<br><br>"Lala?!" the countess turned towards her running bodyguard, yet the paparazzi blocked the passage right away.<br><br>"Get out of the way, freaks, or I'll move you myself!" she exclaimed and began making her way by force.<br><br>The bodyguard ran. From being seen naked in public by thousands of people in person and millions online. From all the unwanted stares, catcalls, and jests that made her lose her mind. From the shame of being unable to perform her duties and spread the Sanflarian culture like Leo wanted her to. Only one word echoed through Lala's mind as she ran down a busy street in the buff, bumping into people and enduring a whole variety of reactions: failure.<br><br>She finally stopped at a nearby park, embarrassed, scared, and humiliated.<br><br>"Rats..." Lala said to herself as she hid in a bush amidst the greenery, praying that nobody would find her for at least a couple of minutes.<br><br>Tears began streaming down Lala's eyes, and she closed her face with her hands. She cried and sobbed, not knowing what to do with herself anymore. The girl's body was still shaking throughout as if struck by lightning. It was the worst day of her life, no competition.<br><br>However, after a minute, she felt another sensation. A tingle, weak yet persistent, that made her nipples hard like it was winter. It was strange and clearly out of place in this dire situation. But when Lala remembered her pathetic retreat once more, she couldn't hide it anymore. She was aroused.<br><br>For some reason, under her happy and naÃ¯ve demeanor hid a twisted desire to be degraded. Maybe it was due to the harshness of her windstriking teachers, who frequently punished her, or a sense of freedom that came with failure, but one thing was for certain: right now this feeling was at its peak. The more Lala thought about the delegation thinking she was a coward, a bad bodyguard, and a pathetic Sanflarian, the more she liked it.<br><br>But thinking about Earthians was even better: many of them probably thought she was a dumb whore with no sense of decency, or a prostitute desperate to find clients, or someone so bad at dating that she had to strip naked in public just to make men interested in her... Those thoughts filled Lala's head so quickly she didn't even notice when her palm landed on her pussy.<br><br>The next thing the girl knew was that she was masturbating in the park, wildly fingering herself with one hand and squeezing her nipple with another so hard it hurt. Her clit swelled up like never before, and she got so wet you'd think she just had a shower. While she cared to not get too dirty at first, soon she simply lay down on the ground and let mud along with leaves cover her sweaty body while her moans filled the entire section of the park.<br><br>Finally, when Lala felt her mind completely succumb to her deepest sexual fantasies and lost herself in the pleasure, she allowed herself to finish. She came hard, squirting on the ground below her. Then came a short moment of pure bliss. Lala threw her hands back and kept lying in the mud with her legs spread wide, feeling dirty and disgusting like a pig. She absolutely loved it.<br><br>But like many good things, the moment was over in the blink of an eye.<br><br>"R-rats... What have I done?!" A horrible realization came to Lala's mind once the orgasm passed.<br><br>She left her post near Lady Eleonora, allowed the paparazzi to intimidate her to the point of committing a taboo of hiding her beauty, and just masturbated in a mud puddle like a complete pervert! This day alone could've ruined her entire windstriking career and made her shunned throughout Kir'ador. The orgasm clearly wasn't worth it.<br><br>"What will Leo think?!" she asked herself, biting her lips as her eyes got wet again.<br><br>It looked like Lala wouldn't have to guess for long, as she soon heard a familiar voice calling out to her.<br><br>"You there, bestie?" the blonde asked from behind the nearby treeline.<br><br>Lala was about to jump away, but it was already too late: the voice was too close and soon gave way to the rustling of the bushes around her.` },
      { title: "Chapter 11", summary: "Leo's friend goes on a naked adventure of her own.", content: `Lala's Losing Streak<br><br>"Found y..." Eleonora started her sentence but didn't finish it, falling silent after her eyes landed on Lala's figure. Her dirty, sweaty, and clearly not long after orgasm figure.<br><br>"My lady," the bodyguard muttered and awkwardly stood on one knee, unable to even look in the blonde's eyes in her immense embarrassment.<br><br>She expected her mistress to furrow her brow and cast a judgmental gaze at this shameful display. Or, maybe, to start berating her for leaving her side when she needed a bodyguard the most. Possibly even threaten to denounce her and end her servitude to the Kir'ador nobles.<br><br>Instead, Leo burst out laughing so loudly she made it even harder for the passersby to ignore the two.<br><br>"Wow," the countess said with a wink. "I see you're not wasting your time. Here I was, thinking my bodyguard got scared of the paparazzi so much she had to retreat. And it turns out you just got aroused from their attention and started pleasuring yourself, huh? I knew you were shameless, but that's bold even for you, babe."<br><br>"Y-yeah. Well, what can I do? A girl has needs!" she finally muttered and shrugged like a cartoon character.<br><br>Then she flinched since Leo gave her a hard buttslap, playing around with whom she thought was a naughty, fearless nudist. If only she knew how wrong she was... Or maybe she was at least somewhat correct? Lala recalled that wave of pleasure that covered her whole when she hid in the bushes. It went away minutes ago, but already felt so alien, like she was a totally different person back then. Arousal must've overtaken her personality in that moment of weakness.<br><br>"Or maybe that was my personality all along," a thought appeared in her head against her will, yet she quickly brushed it off.<br><br>"I'm sorry, my lady. I know I shouldn't have left you there."<br><br>"Don't worry about it too much. It's your first mission, and getting turned on from showing off to all of those gawking Earthians isn't new... Trust me, I recently nearly got abducted because of the same exact feeling."<br><br>"Will I get punished?" Lala meant to ask this with fear and guilt, yet it turned out almost joyful.<br><br>"We'll see," Leo nodded to her thoughtful servant. "I mean, I could always kick your slit until it's blue or tie your limbs together to make you jump around like a rabbit for a change..."<br><br>Lala gulped but couldn't notice the odd tingle in her nipples and pussy acting up again.<br><br>"...But I need you to be ready if we are attacked again. So let's think about this later."<br><br>"Y-yes, my lady," she said with gratitude while desperately trying to wipe the mud off her figure.<br><br>It didn't do much, and Lala's cheeks became rosy again. While Sanflarian women were allowed to do whatever they wanted while naked, it was still bad courtesy for a noble's servant to appear in such a messy state in public. Even if the public wasn't Sanflarian. Well, maybe except for the Fryion Province and its famed mud bathing, but this place was far from it either way. The countess once again looked at Lala with sympathy, understanding her peculiar state.<br><br>"Oh, I think I know how to make it so you don't have to be perceived as the dirty girl."<br><br>Leo clicked her fingers and, before Lala could even ask what she meant, dove right into the same mud puddle like it was a pile of fresh snow. The bodyguard gasped when she saw her countess roll around in the mud like a pig, doing mud angels and smearing the liquid all over her until she was even dirtier than Lala. She didn't even spare her famous mane, turning it into a squishy mess.<br><br>"My lady! W-why?"<br><br>"Now we're both dirty girls, so you won't be the only one!" the blonde giggled and smacked her bestie's butt again.<br><br>Lala couldn't help but laugh. Leo replied in kind with her head confidently leaned back. Soon, the two of them were walking on a paved park road in full view of the surrounding locals. The people either moved out of the way or pointed at the muddy beauties with laughs, although a couple of them offered medical assistance, probably thinking these two were insane.<br><br>Leo politely declined and led her friend to the nearest fountain to wash off the mud and give the locals a little show they could remember. Lala was still horribly ashamed, but at least now her gratitude and pride in her lady overshadowed that weakness and let her enjoy this moment of camaraderie. Lala truly was lucky to serve such an awesome noble.<br><br>Then why couldn't she just tell Leo the truth?<br><br>***<br><br>The day passed surprisingly quickly, and soon Lala again found herself embracing Leo in their king-sized bed. It felt so calm with Leo softly snoring beside Lala, her head resting on the bodyguard's boob, that she nearly forgot about how horrible today was. The emotions she felt from her public exposure grew more convoluted and confusing, but one thing was obvious: they prevented Lala from doing her job and protecting her lady like she was supposed to.<br><br>While the countess was asleep for some time already, Lala spent the last hour brooding about her past and future actions. Finally, she remembered her windstriking lessons and figured that the only way of beating her weakness was by training. She whined a little when she imagined herself "practicing" public nudity again, yet there was no other choice. If her career and loyalty were on the line, there was only one possible solution. Tonight, Lala was going streaking.<br><br>The bodyguard carefully freed herself from the sleeping countess' embrace and gave her a peck on the cheek as a thanks for her kindness. Then, she looked at the clock--it was midnight--and mustered up the courage to leave the comfort of the suite. There was no better way of facing her fears than going outside alone, and if that was what it took, Lala was ready. At least that's what she told herself to keep her heart from jumping out of her chest.<br><br>Lala got goosebumps as she strode through the hotel's lobby filled with bright lights and guests waiting for their rooms. She caught a few glances and a whistle but made sure to continue walking as if nothing was happening. Despite the storm of emotions raging inside of her. Soon, she was outside with a cool breeze caressing her naked body. Lala didn't really know where she was going, but she hoped that the hotel's building was large enough for her to find her way back in case she got lost.<br><br>"W-well, here goes nothing," Lala muttered to herself when her bare feet touched the asphalt.<br><br>It felt surreal to be scared of her own nudity like this, but Lala still couldn't shake the feeling off, even after almost a week spent on Earth. The streets were quiet at this hour, but not deserted: Lala still encountered occasional passersby and cars, who clearly saw her as well. Thankfully, most of them ignored the naked girl as if nothing was happening, though there were still occasional catcalls and honks, to which Lala smiled and waved, trying her best to imitate Leo.<br><br>Her thoughts became chaotic each time she walked under a lantern or her figure got basked in the headlights' beams. Yet she forced herself to walk on at a leisurely pace despite her mind telling her to flee. Soon, another feeling got added to Lala's already exhausting ordeal: her nipples got hard, and a tingle in her pussy came back. Thinking about what the people might've thought about her made her aroused again.<br><br>"Oh, Many-eyed, I can get addicted to this," she thought with a shy smile, turning the corner.<br><br>The next street was more crowded than the previous one. Its bars and nightclubs made sure some people stayed here long after the sunset. Even now Lala could see several groups drinking and loudly laughing outside. Once again, it took all of the girl's bravery to block her fears and walk onwards, diving right into the nearby crowd.<br><br>The people quickly noticed, pointing at her and exclaiming something in English. Unfortunately, Lala didn't understand a word, but she could tell they liked what they saw by their voices and expressions. A smile appeared on Lala's lips once again while she walked past the rowdy partygoers, her ears getting assaulted by their cheering. It felt different from how she felt before, though. Maybe her grins and giggles weren't so forced anymore.<br><br>Still, it was very hard to move forward. Lala's legs got weak, and she had to consciously force herself to move forward. It got even harder when several of the clubgoers around her pulled out their phones and started filming. One of them approached Lala, asking something and pointing at the camera. She nodded, and the man stood right beside her with his arm on her shoulder, posing for a picture taken by his friend.<br><br>Then, others followed their example and nearly formed a line to commemorate this joyful moment. Lala felt a surge of adrenaline that made it hard to stay still, yet her windstriking practice taught her how to assume a stance and remain in it as long as necessary. She'd never think it'd be useful in a situation like this!<br><br>The pink-haired girl quickly became the main attraction, with people seemingly walking out of the nearby venues just to ogle her beautiful, athletic body. Her rosy cheeks and shy smile seemed to attract people even more, some of them trying to strike up a conversation or offering her something to wear (which she refused despite her urge to cover herself). One man even shared his drink with Lala, and she agreed, letting alcohol loosen her up a bit. She must've expected to get her number or at least a talk, but soon realized she didn't speak English and just kept gawking at her breasts.<br><br>"Sankiy, sankiy," Lala said with a thick accent, both shy and excited to be the center of attention once again.<br><br>However, soon the attention got overwhelming, and Lala felt the need to walk onward, waving her new friends goodbye after a couple more photos. She felt several hands slapping her butt once she left, making her pick up the pace with naughty laughter. It suddenly got warmer outside, although it was probably just her getting hot from this encounter.<br><br>Lala felt her nipples get harder and harder and her hand moving to her pussy seemingly on its own. Especially when she passed several girls who looked at her with visible judgment in their eyes. It took her a lot of effort to not start masturbating right then and there, fantasizing about how much of a slut they saw her as.<br><br>The bodyguard's adventure continued like this for quite some time as shame and arousal kept battling in her foggy mind. She passed a residential, deserted street, although it also had a couple of fun moments with singular passersby encountering the naked girl and not believing what they just saw. She just blew them air kisses and walked forward, wiggling her wide hips and letting her tits freely jiggle along to embarrass herself even more.<br><br>Then, there was a peculiar touristic area with green gates and unique architecture Lala had never seen before. There were red, round lanterns hanging from the roofs and odd inscriptions that reminded Lala of Sanflarian numbers. Some people, probably tourists, were glad to see the naked girl walk by them and took pictures of her with glee in their eyes. Others, who must've been locals, reacted by scoffing and shouting angrily.<br><br>Of course, it only made Lala revel in her shame even more and forced her to act even more shamelessly, sometimes bending down like she dropped something, skipping on the pavement, or shaking her tits in front of her allured audience. Some new energy awoke inside of Lala, and it was uncontainable. She fully grasped it after sitting down on a bench in a local park and finding out she was thoroughly wet once again.<br><br>There were bushes nearby, but Lala's brain was so enveloped by horniness she didn't even want to hide anymore. Instead, she sat on the bench's back and spread her legs as wide as she could, landing her bare feet on the bench's lower half. A young couple passed by and quickly turned away from Lala, so embarrassed they couldn't even raise their heads.<br><br>That was the final straw. Lala felt so degraded and humiliated that she simply couldn't go on anymore. Finally, the girl landed her palm on her pussy and began touching herself with her breast in her other hand just like before. The girl's brain got flooded with memories of her shameful voyage, making her lose her mind to the raw sexual pleasure.<br><br>Her current situation was even better, as anyone could've walked up to her right now and seen what she was doing. Then, Lala noticed a security camera aimed right at her, and this became too much to bear. She came even harder than before, her delighted scream echoing through the entire park.<br><br>A minute later, Lala slowly slid down the bench and threw her hands back, breathing heavily. A wave of doubt came to her mind again, making her question what she just did. Was she really such a pervert, or was it simply stress making her act in ways she never would otherwise? Either way, it didn't seem healthy at all, and Lala doubted it'll help her keep her cool during the next public appearance with Leo.<br><br>"Rats, what the heck am I doing?!" she finally got up, her limbs shaking from this inner conflict.<br><br>Unfortunately, she didn't have time to resolve it, as a stern female voice from behind unknowingly answered her question.<br><br>"Tsk-tsk-tsk. Breaking the law again? You bitches never learn."<br><br>Lala turned around, not understanding a word but recognizing a threat. Two police officers stood in front of her, a man and a woman, with the female one having light hair and a large pair of sunglasses despite it being dark outside. Lala could've remembered Leo's description of Angel, but she was so shaken right now she couldn't even form a coherent thought.<br><br>The people in blue said something to one another, and the woman walked behind Lala. Suddenly, the bodyguard felt her hands getting restrained after a clasp. She tried to move them, but couldn't. The handcuffs were too sturdy. The man gave Lala a disapproving look and shook his head. He tried to seem just, but there was an evil spark in his eyes that made it clear Lala won't get any justice from him.<br><br>Lala tried explaining herself. She apologized, asked to tell Leo, and repeatedly yelled the word "Sanflaria" to at least make her position known despite the language barrier. But nothing worked. Whoever these officers were, they seemed set on arresting the naked bodyguard despite her protests. Instead of responding to her pleas, they exchanged a couple of phrases and made Lala walk to their car, giving her a rude smack on the butt with evil grins on their faces. Surprisingly, it wasn't a police car, just a regular one, as if they were off-duty.<br><br>Lala was scared again, but this time, this feeling wasn't pleasant or arousing, not even one bit. What were they going to do to her? How would the delegation react to her getting into yet another scandal right when Baron Araman tried his best to smoothen the interworld relations? How will she explain to Leo what she was doing? All of these questions weighed heavily on Lala's bare shoulders, making her eyes wet once again.<br><br>When they got into the car, Officer Angel said something with that devilish grin of hers, clearly meant to be taunting. Lala didn't respond. She simply curled up into a ball and let the gods decide her fate since she lost any control over it anyway. Looking at the stars high above, Lala could only hope the Many-eyed will be merciful this time.<br><br>Her stress only grew when she realized they weren't going to where Earthians usually brought their criminals. The car swiftly passed the police station and headed somewhere else, towards a quiet and dilapidated area near the coast. Lala tried asking where they were going, but the cops didn't say a word. The pink-haired girl even considered jumping out of the car but was too scared to make everything even worse.<br><br>Finally, the car stopped, and Lala noticed a dark, industrial-looking building in front of her. Angel and the long-haired, tall officer seemingly named "David" stepped out of the vehicle and opened Lala's door. Before she could say a word, they rudely pulled her from the seat and dragged her into that old building with the same malicious grins.<br><br>This was so horrifying that Lala even considered breaking free and beating these two up with just her feet but quickly realized that they weren't alone here. The building's doors opened with a loud noise, and several figures stepped onto the road. Four large, athletic men with disdain in their eyes and one slim girl in a dress whom Lala recognized from somewhere.<br><br>Soon, it became obvious when she saw her, as they met not long ago: the girl was there during the protest, one of the Textilians unlucky to be stripped by Leo completely naked.<br><br>***<br><br>Today's morning was far from pleasant for Leo. When she woke up, she quickly noticed that Lala's warm, beautiful body wasn't in her arms, although it didn't seem suspicious at first. It became suspicious after the countess realized that Lala was nowhere to be seen. Moreover, the only real clue the hotel's management gave her was that her bodyguard just left the suite and walked somewhere in the middle of the night.<br><br>This made Leo rightfully anxious, and she searched through the entire place, asking both employees and guests about her missing friend. This yielded no results--not counting all the happy faces of men who saw the countess run around the hotel in the nude with her breasts bouncing along--and made the countess even more upset.<br><br>One of the female guests, a beautiful but bitchy blonde in her twenties, felt Leo's wrath on herself when she rudely replied to her question, indirectly stating that Lala was a whore. A minute later, that same guest was already running through the lobby completely naked with terror and shame in her eyes while her torn clothes lay scattered on the stairs and red spanking marks covered her backside. Thankfully, Arnold came in before Leo could've caused more havoc, but his demeanor was far from calm. All because of a single email he received the previous night that both solved Lala's missing case and made it more complicated.<br><br>Greetings to Eleonora of Kir'ador. I suppose you already realized that your friend is missing. Not gonna lie, she's quite a catch! It took us a lot of preparation and tailing to get her, but now she's finally with us. Don't worry, we didn't hurt her. Yet. Whether we will do that in the future depends entirely on you, Leo. If you wish to see your dear Lartimila again, come meet us at 12 AM. Don't bring anyone, and I mean anyone, with you, otherwise, there'll be consequences that none of your perverted stunts can fix.<br><br>It was followed by the address and a signature, although no name was given. Instead, the sender assumed Leo "knew who they were" and didn't feel the need to specify that. Arnold said he and his coworkers already tried to pinpoint the exact location of the message and the account that sent it, but they covered their tracks very well. As if they had some connections within the system themselves.<br><br>"Damn it, it takes a whole lot of intimidation to make Lala say her whole name. It must be that bitch!" Leo clenched her fists and hit the table in a fit of rage, making Arnold jump.<br><br>"You mean Officer Angel? Do you think she's actually looking to pick more fights after what you've done to her team?"<br><br>"Of course! Who else would be smug enough to write like that? She must be seeking revenge, and if she chooses this path, I'll be sure to oblige!"<br><br>With these words, Leo began walking out of the room, but Arnold made sure to stop her.<br><br>"W-wait. You're not actually going to follow her instructions, are you?" the agent asked with pleading eyes.<br><br>Leo rolled her eyes, still not herself from all the anger she felt.<br><br>"Come on, it's clearly a trap! We have the government on our side... Well, most of it I suppose. Let them handle the job!" Arnold said, but quickly realized that last line didn't sound too convincing. "A-anyway, Angel clearly wants you, not Lala. She won't hurt her if she knows you'll be interested in saving her. But that's what she expects. On the other hand, if we send a special task force..."<br><br>"I've never seen your special task forces in action, and your government already failed to bring Angel to justice last week! No... this is a personal insult to the entire Sanflaria, and, as a Sanflarian noble, it's my responsibility to deal with it."<br><br>"Leo, please. At least let's tell Araman about it."<br><br>The countess let out a loud sigh, clearly remembering her last conversation with the baron. However, she still believed in the idea of acting as a united front, so Arnold's pleas were not in vain. The agent wiped the sweat off his brow, thankful that he could do at least something.<br><br>Soon, however, it turned out that Araman's assistance wasn't as much of a boon as the agent thought. The baron agreed to sending ICA agents and some of the other trained US soldiers to free Lala while keeping Leo safe, but convincing her remained an issue.<br><br>"We have a clear numerical advantage. Judging by the amount of policewomen who jumped you and Mr. Luxe earlier, I doubt they have an army in that facility," the baron reasoned.<br><br>"How can you not understand?" Leo was still having none of it, walking around the suite and throwing her arms in the air. "The numerical advantage doesn't matter at all if that scum has my bestie. They'll probably spot your soldiers a mile away and kill Lala right then just to hurt us! We cannot risk her life like that."<br><br>"This is understandable. But you must understand that our first priority is not risking your life, Lady Eleonora," Araman said in a voice that gave Arnold chills.<br><br>He truly was a loyal servant of his nation, even when serving it required making tough choices.<br><br>"Oh, so Lala's life doesn't matter just because she's not a noble? What got into you, baron?!" Leo stared the man down angrily, her brow furrowed and her hands crossed under her alluring breasts.<br><br>"I never said that," he responded calmly.<br><br>"Yes, but you must've thought that. Trust me, I know that my survival is more important for our mission than Lala's. But she's my servant and my friend. As a noble, I must protect her at all costs, especially during a conflict like this one. So her survival is important for me, and that's that. You can disagree with me all you want; I'm still the highest-ranking noble in the delegation and can make my own decisions."<br><br>Araman fell silent, thoroughly thinking about his response. However, Leo didn't wait for it. Instead, she went on the balcony and stared into the distance while the summer breeze caressed her naked body. The good weather didn't bring her joy anymore, and the catcalls of the people below didn't make her smile. The only thing she was focused on was that somewhere in this city, her best friend was being held hostage.<br><br>"Just why did you have to leave like that?" Leo sighed.<br><br>The careful, slow footsteps behind her back indicated that Arnold was about to say something but hesitated.<br><br>"I know you'll still do it, you know."<br><br>"Do what?" the agent asked in surprise.<br><br>"Send some of your special forces. You personally will see to it, Arnold," the blonde turned around and leaned on the balcony's windowsill.<br><br>Arnold looked at her for a moment. Leo looked like a goddess from this angle, the bright sunrays perfectly illuminating the curves and planes of her body. If they'll still be friends after this trip, he'll surely ask whether he could travel to Sanflaria to see Leo's nudity under her homeland's sun.<br><br>"Listen," the beauty in front of him made him a bit more confident, "I understand that this is your decision, but..."<br><br>"Don't worry. I know you'll call them as soon as I leave. Because you think I'm being too emotional and you care about me," Leo's lips curled in a bitter smile. "You've grown a lot since we first met, you know? That clerk beside the portal would never dare to stand up to me like that. Keep doing that, women like assertiveness."<br><br>A wave of shame overtook Arnold's mind when Leo finished that phrase. Why did she have to fluster him like that? However, he still mustered up the courage to finish his thought, even while staring at the floor and his cheeks all rosy:<br><br>"Men like it, too, although most don't like talking about it, he-he. Listen, I know I cannot convince you, but will you at least let me help? We can keep ICA at a safe distance as a backup, but you'll still need to prepare if you want to meet that scum. If we're walking into their trap, we'll need to keep them from closing it."<br><br>Leo thought about it for a moment, carefully weighing all of the pros and cons of this decision. The agent was right by saying that just blindly rushing into that storage building would be a mistake. Angel thought she was a predator, so Leo had to become a hunter instead of prey. After putting her emotions aside for a moment, the countess decided to agree.<br><br>"Alright, partner. Only two of us in the vanguard. Just like in Nevada! Tell me everything you think would help."<br><br>"Just like in Nevada," Arnold repeated and suddenly felt a sharp pain in his back.<br><br>He could only hope that the ending of that encounter wouldn't send him to the hospital with a gunshot wound.` }
