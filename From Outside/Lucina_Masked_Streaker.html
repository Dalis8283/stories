      { title: "Chapter 1", summary: "Reflection", content: "The sun had just set, the plains were quiet, and a peaceful ambiance filled the autumn air at the Shepherds' camp. Chrom and his recruits had established this base strategically close to a handful of small towns and one major city, giving them the benefit of proximity in the event of bandit attacks, as well as plenty of access to resources.<br><br>The attacks had been slowing down, however, leaving the Shepherds without much to do other than train. Lucina had, of course, taken these many uneventful hours to hone her strength and skills as much as she could. After a long day of practicing her sword swings and sparring against dummies, Lucina was feeling rather spent as she entered her private quarters.<br><br>Since this camp had been designed for longevity, the Shepherds' personal tents were rather cozy, with plenty of space and comfortable furnishings. Lucina brushed the tent's entrance flaps to her sides as she staggered inside, not bothering to tie them shut with the attached cloth bindings. She leaned Falchion against the firm wall of the tent, and breathed a heavy sigh as she flopped onto her bed.<br><br>‶Perhaps I did push myself a little too hard today...‶ Lucina thought to herself as she lay face-down on the mattress. She rolled over onto her back and let out a deep exhale, feeling overheated in her battle gear. As comfortable and stylish as it was, the outfit did tend to insulate a lot of heat, which was not always ideal for combat wear.<br><br>Taking a long, meditative inhalation through her nose, Lucina noticed another problem. ‶Goodness, I smell terrible...‶ she thought, her cheeks going pink. At this point, it was abundantly clear to Lucina what she needed to do. It was time to enjoy a nice bath!<br><br>Lucina smiled just thinking about it. Ever since Ricken and the other mages had figured out that incantation, the Shepherds had effectively had access to an endless supply of fresh, clean water. It was stored and used for drinking, cleaning, bathing, and more, so the discovery of how to cast the spell was considered by all the recruits to be a major milestone. ‶Thank you, mages...‶ Lucina thought, never taking their brilliance for granted.<br><br>Lucina sat up on her bed, feeling generally icky in her sweaty clothes. She looked over at her robe, which hung on a rack in the corner, and wondered about something. The bathing tents weren't far... Surely she could walk there in just her robe, couldn't she?<br><br>One thing she knew for certain was that she couldn't stand another minute in this outfit. She decided that the short walk in her robe would be fine, and began undressing. She reached down and began pulling off her boots, the first step in the long process of removing her battle gear. As she got started on her upper body, she eagerly imagined the sights, smells, and sounds of her upcoming bath, eagerly awaiting feeling fresh and clean.<br><br>Once Lucina's outerwear was removed, all that was left was her two-piece bodysuit, made of soft, stretchy fabric which clung tightly to her form. Eager to be freed from the stuffy garments, Lucina pulled her arms out of her sleeves and tossed the top over her head, and then slid her pants all the way off, casting them away to the corner of the room. Completely naked, Lucina stood up and stretched her arms outwards, happy to finally be rid of the cumbersome gear.<br><br>On her way over to the rack which held her robe, Lucina incidentally caught a glimpse of herself in her full-length mirror. Her face went red and she hopped backwards at the unexpected sight. She had only ever used the mirror for its intended purpose, which was checking the fit and quality of her gear, so seeing her entire nude body reflected in it came as a bit of a shock. She used her right hand to hide her crotch, and covered her chest with her left arm, with which she could feel her heart beating a little faster than usual.<br><br>Lucina tiptoed past the mirror again, her eyes going wide at the sight of herself in this state of complete undress. Instead of continuing towards her robe, she stopped and looked at her reflection. She wasn't sure what it was, but there was something about the image of her, nude from head to toe and hiding her privates, that she found strangely compelling.<br><br>Lucina stood up straight, maintaining her cover as she looked herself in the eyes. She stared for a moment or two until she had a realization: She'd never really taken the time to look at herself in the mirror in this way before. Her full body, with no armor, no Falchion, no cape, no clothes at all... Just Lucina.<br><br>She looked down at her hands, which covered her intimate parts from view. ‶I suppose there's nothing to hide...‶ Lucina thought, wanting to see her entire natural form all at once. Trembling and anxious, she slowly moved her left arm away from her chest, exposing herself as she placed her arm at her side.<br><br>Lucina's heart raced as she beheld her bare breasts, which she'd noticed time and time again were much smaller than all the other female Shepherds'. While some of her friends like Olivia and Tharja boasted bountiful busts, Lucina's chest had never really come in.<br><br>Even though she felt silly letting herself be occupied with such frivolous matters as her own appearance, her chest did make her feel self-conscious now and then. Looking at it now, however, Lucina felt rather content. Although she didn't have large breasts, her skin looked smooth, and her light pink nipples looked pretty.<br><br>She noticed they had actually become erect at some point, to her surprise. It wasn't cold in her tent in the slightest, so she knew she'd become aroused. Perhaps that was why she was in this strange mood... ‶I suppose it has been a while, hasn't it?‶ she thought with a lewd grin.<br><br>Lucina moved her hand away from her crotch, and her suspicions were confirmed by the slight wetness on her fingertips. She wore a lewd smile, knowing she'd have to take care of that at some point soon.<br><br>She took a step closer to the mirror, wanting to take a look at her most private area. Lucina's vagina was a cute, dignified, and somewhat little one. It was adorned with a small bush of pubic hair above it, the same shade of blue as the hair on her head.<br><br>Having never seen someone else naked, Lucina always wondered if that was the case for other people. Did they have hair near their genitals as well, and was it the same color as the rest of their hair? Did Anna sport that striking shade of scarlet, and were Olivia's privates accompanied by light pink hair?<br><br>Lucina giggled, deeming herself naughty for even considering such things. ‶Perhaps I'd best make haste to the bath to clean this dirty mind of mine...‶ she thought with a chuckle.<br><br>Before Lucina grabbed her robe, she decided to take a quick peek at how she looked from behind. She swiveled around as best she could, and was able to get an adequate rear view of herself in the mirror.<br><br>She saw nothing too unexpected at first, but let out a gasp as her eyes traveled lower. Was her bottom really that big? It was so much more prominent and round against the rest of her slender form than she'd estimated. It was by no means enormous, but it was curvy and perky and cute, much more so than she'd thought.<br><br>Lucina blushed fiercely as she stared in the mirror at her own butt. All this time, it had been following her everywhere she went... She felt lucky that her regular clothing was modest enough to keep it covered.<br><br>Lucina straightened out again, and placed her hands on her bare hips as she looked over her naked body one last time.<br><br>‶So this is how I look naked, I suppose...‶ she thought. Slowly, she began to smile. ‶Perhaps my chest is a bit small, or maybe my rear end is a bit big, but I'm happy to call this body my own,‶ Lucina thought, grinning.<br><br>Not wanting to delay any longer, she figured it was about time to put her robe on. Before she could, though, she heard a voice from behind her, which was clearly coming from inside the tent.<br><br>‶Hi, Lucina, have you-‶ the voice said, before stopping suddenly.<br><br>Lucina, terribly startled, leapt into the air and spun around on the spot, left facing the source of the sound. Standing just inside the tent was Olivia, who was frozen in a state of shock.<br><br>Lucina, equally shocked, stood for a second or two without saying a word, covering no part of herself as she processed what was happening. When it clicked at last, Lucina promptly covered her private parts as quickly as she could, and backed away while letting out a little embarrassed shriek.<br><br>Olivia, perhaps the most shy and reserved of all the Shepherds, had been unable to process the horror of what she'd done up until now. She had walked in on Lucina completely naked! She crouched down, slammed her eyes shut, and buried her face in her hands before beginning her apology. ‶L-L-Lucina! I'm so sorry, I...‶<br><br>Lucina tripped and stumbled backwards onto her bed, her legs spread wide and her nether regions wholly exposed. She was incredibly grateful that Olivia had hidden her face.<br><br>‶How did this happen? Surely I... Damn! I forgot to fasten the flaps shut!‶ Lucina thought, having realized her grievous error. ‶It's okay, Olivia, it's okay!‶ Lucina said as she scrambled for her blanket, not wanting Olivia to feel guilty.<br><br>The pink-haired girl was inconsolable, however, and was even more humiliated than Lucina was. It was hard to tell, as her face was hidden, but she appeared to be crying, or close to it.<br><br>‶Gods, this is all my fault...‶ Lucina thought, wanting to make things right quickly. Boldly abandoning the cover of her blanket, Lucina dashed across the room and grabbed her robe, donning it as fast as she could and securely tying it closed. ‶I'm covered now, Olivia. You don't have to hide your face anymore,‶ Lucina said, crouching beside her.<br><br>Olivia slowly moved her hands away from her face and made eye contact with Lucina, a tear streaming down each cheek. ‶I should've said I was coming in...‶ Olivia said, closing her eyes and turning her head away.<br><br>‶No, Olivia, I left the door flaps untied! That means my tent was open to visitors. You didn't do anything wrong,‶ Lucina consoled.<br><br>‶T-Thank you, but... Goodness, I'm just so embarrassed, and so sorry,‶ Olivia said with a sniffle.<br><br>‶There's nothing to be sorry for, it was just an accident,‶ Lucina said, smiling warmly. ‶If I had tied my door closed like we're supposed to when we don't want visitors, you would've known not to come in. So really it's my fault,‶ Lucina assured.<br><br>‶I still should have said something earlier...‶ Olivia insisted.<br><br>‶No, you were... Well, regardless, it's not a big deal, right?‶ Lucina asked, doing everything in her power to comfort her friend.<br><br>‶But I... Ohh... I saw your... And... Oh my goodness...‶ Olivia was no longer crying, but her face was beet-red, and she was stumbling over her words.<br><br>Lucina tried not to think about what Olivia had seen, wanting to focus on smoothing things over. ‶I think we'll both feel better if we forget it ever happened, don't you?‶ Lucina said nicely.<br><br>Olivia cleared her throat, took a breath, and adopted a more composed demeanor as she stood all the way up. ‶You're right, let's try and forget it...‶ she said, doing her best to smile.<br><br>‶Mhm... Now, what was it you needed?‶ Lucina asked, standing up as well.<br><br>‶I, um... Hmm... I can't seem to remember, actually...‶ Olivia said, her cheeks still pink.<br><br>‶Well, if you remember, let me know!‶ Lucina said with a smile.<br><br>‶Of course. Thank you, Lucina. I'm, uh, I had better go now,‶ Olivia said, leaving the tent in a hurry.<br><br>Lucina breathed a heavy sigh, wracked with guilt over having sent Olivia into such a distressed state. What an eventful evening this had turned into... A relaxing bath was just what Lucina needed at a time like this. After making certain her robe was tied shut tightly, the blue-haired swordswoman left her tent and made her way toward the baths, hoping she wasn't visibly blushing as she walked along." },
      { title: "Chapter 2", summary: "The Bathing Tent", content: "Lucina walked along the path, clad only in her robe, which was a pastel shade of blue that complemented her hair and eyes nicely. Fortunately, she had reached the bathing tents without incident. These tents were large, sturdy, and constructed carefully with privacy in mind. At the moment, it appeared that all of them were vacant, so Lucina headed into the nearest one, tying the tent flaps shut behind her.<br><br>Just inside the entrance was a thin wooden barrier mounted to the fabric floor, tall and wide enough to block the room from view should the flaps not be tied shut properly. Lucina walked around it and entered the main body of the room, which was lit nicely by a few enchanted lamps, which could burn for hours and hours using hardly any fuel. A similar enchantment was used for the heating system, a series of small, controlled flames which burned in a row beneath the water reservoir. This reservoir was essentially a tall metal tank situated against the far wall, with a small trough leading directly into the square stone bathtub in the corner. All it took was a turn of a small faucet mechanism, and warm, refreshing water would begin to fill the bath. Considering this Shepherd settlement was temporary by design, these bathing facilities were rather lavish, and were a luxury which Lucina never took for granted.<br><br>After gathering her soap and a clean towel, Lucina turned on the faucet and watched as the water began trickling from the tank. The slow rate of transfer was a mild annoyance for the blue-haired woman, as she couldn't wait to step into her bath. She crossed her arms and waited, wishing it could go faster as she tapped her fingers against the soft cloth of her robe.<br><br>‶Hm, I may as well get this off, in the meantime...‶ Lucina thought before reaching for the knot at her belly. She promptly undid the ties and slid the robe off her shoulders, letting it fall to the floor.<br><br>Now properly dressed for bathing, Lucina took a look at the water level; unfortunately, getting naked had not sped up the process.<br><br>‶Ugh, what to do...‶ Lucina thought impatiently, taking a seat on the wide edge of the bath. She noted that it was still a rather comfortable seat in spite of it being made of hard stone. It was as though she were seated on a plush, squishy cushion. It was then that Lucina recalled what she'd seen in the mirror earlier, and a blush formed on her cheeks... A blush which only intensified once she remembered that Olivia had seen it too.<br><br>The image was fresh in Lucina's mind. Her plump, round, bubbly butt... It was bigger and more pronounced than she'd ever thought, and Olivia had seen every inch of it laid bare.<br><br>Just the thought made Lucina's cheeks turn red. She was among the most respected, dignified warriors the continent had ever known, and Olivia had seen her curvy, embarrassingly prominent rear end, completely exposed.<br><br>And that wasn't all. Lucina had turned her whole body around to face Olivia straight on, so she'd seen everything. In that moment, Lucina could practically feel Olivia's eyes on her breasts, or lack thereof. They'd always been small, and they'd always made her self-conscious.<br><br>‶Maybe they'll think my armor compresses my chest... Maybe they'll just think the shape of my clothes hides some of the curvature...‶ Lucina would reassure herself. But today, there had been no clothing to help her. Her chest was nearly as flat as a skinny man's, and it had been plainly visible to her friend, nipples and all.<br><br>Her most sacred area, too, had been naked and exposed. The place where her thighs met, where her womanhood was made clear... Olivia knew now what it looked like, and how the blue hair above it matched the hair on Lucina's head.<br><br>Lucina's heart was thumping rapidly, her whole face dyed a deep red as the events from earlier began to fully sink in. Olivia had seen her naked! Totally nude, with all her most private, embarrassing parts showing... Her round bubble butt, her flat chest, her bright blue bush...<br><br>It was totally humiliating, but Lucina couldn't seem to stop thinking about it. As strange as it was, there was something about it that almost felt good. Lucina quickly found herself feeling rather confused. She'd just had the most embarrassing moment of her life, but was deriving enjoyment from replaying it in her head? She did her best to recall how she'd felt as she and Olivia locked eyes, while she wore nothing but a shocked expression. Butterflies stirred in her stomach, and she actually felt a smile coming on. What a bizarre feeling this was!<br><br>She looked down at her nude self, wanting to have a look at what Olivia had seen. ‶My chest really is quite flat... And now Olivia knows it for certain...‶ she thought as she examined her breasts. Her nipples, she noticed, were standing at full attention. But the room was so warm! Could it be, she wondered? She spread her thighs apart and took a look at her own crotch, which confirmed in no uncertain terms that she was clearly aroused.<br><br>‶Hm, I never took care of that earlier, did I?‶ Lucina thought to herself. ‶Perhaps that's what's wrong. I must have trained too hard today, and I'm in need of some relief. Surely that's why I'm all mixed up...‶ she thought as she looked over her shoulder at the bath, which still needed quite a bit more filling.<br><br>She adjusted herself to get more comfortable, crossing her legs and stretching her arms above her head. ‶It's a good thing my big, fat butt makes for such a nice cushion against this hard stone...‶ she thought with a giggle. ‶I wonder what would happen if someone accidentally came in here. With this flat chest of mine, they'd probably think I was a boy!‶ Lucina fantasized with a lewd grin.<br><br>‶We can't have that, can we? I'd better uncross these legs, so they can see I'm definitely a girl!~‶ she thought before doing just that. She was now seated on the edge of the tub with her knees spread far apart, her most private area on full display. ‶There. Now it'll be obvious, should someone come in,‶ her internal monologue remarked. ‶It's just too bad the entrance is tied shut...‶ she conceded. But this gave Lucina an idea.<br><br>Lucina's heart raced as her imagination ran wild. Could she get away with this? It was so scandalous, so naughty... but she simply couldn't stop herself. It had only been the briefest moment's fantasy, but she had to live it out.<br><br>Lucina rose to her feet and, legs shaking, made her way to the tent's entrance. Standing off to the side, she cautiously undid each of the three knots which kept the flaps shut. With the straps now hanging freely, the tent appeared vacant, meaning that anyone could come in at any time. Already, Lucina's breathing had quickened, and she could feel her heart pounding.<br><br>With a spring in her step and a blush on her cheeks, she hastily scurried back to the bathtub, and returned to her seat on its stone rim, thankful once more for the generous amount of padding provided by her bottom. She wore nothing except an excited smile as she splayed her thighs, unable to wait any longer. ‶I hope no one catches me~,‶ Lucina said quietly as she began teasing her lower lips with her dainty fingers.<br><br>Lucina had to stifle a moan the moment she made first contact. Having lived a warrior's life, she had only discovered self-pleasure during the last year or so, and was still learning and improving. It always felt good, but this time, the feeling was just incredible from the start.<br><br>‶I don't think I've ever been so worked up...‶ Lucina thought, still reeling from the brief touch she'd given herself. She took a deep breath and continued, her body quivering from top to bottom as her fingertips returned to their target. She turned her head left and right, examining her surroundings. All that was protecting her from being seen were four thin fabric walls... And with the entrance open, anyone looking to have a bath could come right in at any moment!<br><br>Lucina tucked her soft lips between her teeth to keep herself quiet, driven wild by the very real possibility of being caught. ‶Anyone... Anyone I know could walk in here, and see me...‶ Lucina began moving her fingers a little faster. ‶They'd be able to see my entire body, and how I'm touching myself...‶ She gasped as she pushed a finger in. ‶What would they say? Robin, he'd be so embarrassed himself...‶ She breathed rapidly and rhythmically. ‶Tharja, she'd say I was a degenerate pervert...‶ She gripped the edge of the bath with her free hand. ‶Aunt Lissa... Nothing is more embarrassing than getting caught by family...‶ Lucina was reaching her limit. ‶If Father came in... Nothing could be more humiliating... So relentlessly mortifying... I'd... I'd...‶ <br><br>‶Aaaah~!‶ Lucina let out a loud, unrestrained moan of pleasure as she came. She was completely unable to keep it inside, but in the moment, she didn't care. Her thoughts were elsewhere as she experienced perhaps the most intense physical pleasure of her life.<br><br>Following these few seconds which felt like forever, Lucina came down from her high and back to her senses. It didn't take her long to realize she'd cried out in satisfaction for the whole camp to potentially hear! Her cheeks went red, and she covered her mouth with her clean hand. Before she even had time to hope her outburst had gone unnoticed, she heard a concerned ‶Hello?‶ coming from the tent's entrance, just on the other side of the wooden privacy barrier.<br><br><br><br>Lucina was instantly sent into a panic. Someone had heard her, and they had entered her tent to investigate! ‶Why did I have to untie those straps?!‶ she thought, gritting her teeth. Knowing she only had seconds to act, she looked around as fast as she could for a solution. Her robe was too far away... There was nothing to hide behind... And she was too anxious for words!<br><br>After quick deliberation, Lucina came upon the obvious solution: the bath! She looked behind her, and it seemed the water had finally filled it all the way. She scrambled into the tub, reached for the faucet and gave it a turn, and cowered as low as she could into the water, her eyes fixated on the privacy wall as she waited for the intruder to step out from behind it.<br><br>It was then that her guest was revealed to be Ricken, one of the Shepherds' most gifted mages.<br><br>‶I suppose it could be worse...‶ Lucina thought as Ricken hopped backwards in surprise and shielded his eyes.<br><br>‶L-Lucina! I'm so sorry, I... The tent was open, so I came in to bathe, and I thought I heard you scream just as I came in, and...‶ Ricken fumbled over his words, obviously embarrassed by the situation. Noting his casual clothing and the towel draped over his shoulder, it was clear he was telling the truth about having come for a bath. ‶I'll be on my way, of course... But, are you okay?‶ Ricken asked, facing Lucina but still hiding his face.<br><br>‶Oh! Um, yes! I just... let out a rather loud yawn, is all. My apologies,‶ Lucina lied, hopeful that the young red-haired man's innocence could take precedence over his intelligence in this moment.<br><br>‶No worries, Lucina! I'm sorry to have interrupted. Do you want me to tie the flaps shut on my way out?‶ Ricken offered.<br><br>‶Uh, yes please! Thank you so much, Ricken. I was certain I tied them closed, but I must have forgotten,‶ Lucina claimed, praying that her tone sounded genuine enough.<br><br>‶It's okay, it happens!‶ Ricken replied as he made his way toward the exit, wanting the awkward moment to end more than anything else.<br><br>‶Thanks again!‶ Lucina called, rising out of her bath a little in her newfound solitude.<br><br>‶Wow... Ricken was... A man was in here, while I was completely naked!‶ Lucina thought, her heart beating rapidly. ‶He could've seen everything, had I not been hiding. My boyish chest, and my blue patch... Or if I'd been facing the other way, my big, round bottom...‶ she fantasized. Lucina realized after a moment, however, that getting herself aroused again was probably not the best idea.<br><br>Shaking off her excitement, she focused on getting herself clean. Before long, Lucina was fresh, fragrant, and radiant as could be, and made her way back to her tent clad in her robe. She made sure to tie the straps at the entrance before undoing her robe and letting it fall to the tent's floor.<br><br>Exhausted in every sense of the word, Lucina stumbled over to her bed and lay down upon it. ‶I'll just rest here for a few moments before getting dressed...‶ she told herself as she began drifting off to sleep." },
      { title: "Chapter 3", summary: "Morning Air", content: "Lucina opened her eyes, blinking slowly a few times until she gained focus. She was lying on the ground… outdoors? What was she doing all the way out here? Where was here, anyway?<br><br>Feeling a little boggled and disoriented, she rolled onto her stomach and lifted herself to her feet to take in her surroundings. It appeared she was in a plain of some kind, which was very empty and quite foggy. The air around her also felt rather cool, in an unusual way.<br><br>She wrapped her arms around herself, as though to stave off the chill in the air, when she noticed something wasn't right. She took a look down at herself, and it was what she'd feared… She was completely nude!<br><br>‶Uh-oh…‶ Lucina said quietly as she covered her crotch and nipples as best she could. She'd never been so confused in her life. Why in the world would she wake up naked in the middle of a field? Could this be a dream, she wondered?<br><br>Before she had time to dwell on it, a familiar voice came from behind her.<br><br>‶Lucina!‶ the voice called, prompting the blue-haired girl to twirl around as fast as she could to face it. It was Olivia, who stood shocked and red-faced. ‶You're not wearing any clothes…‶ the shy girl said, her eyes fixated on Lucina's exposed form.<br><br>‶D-Don't look!‶ Lucina pleaded, feeling her cheeks going hot.<br><br>‶Lucina, you're naked!‶ another voice called suddenly from behind. Once again, she turned as fast as she could to identify her new observer. It was Robin, who looked utterly astonished.<br><br>‶Robin? I, um…‶ Lucina began nervously, even more terribly embarrassed to be naked in front of a man.<br><br>‶Oh my…‶ Olivia chimed in from behind, a little giggle seeming to escape from her mouth before she could stop herself. Lucina hadn't realized that in turning to face Robin, she was giving Olivia a perfect rear view.<br><br><br><br>Lucina turned sideways and began stepping backwards so that her bare bottom would be in sight of neither of her friends, but bumped into someone in doing so. Hiding her shame to the best of her ability, she spun around again to meet her third guest.<br><br>It was Lissa, who was grinning gleefully in spite of the situation. ‶Well, you've got a bigger butt than I would've thought, Lucina!‶ she said with a chuckle.<br><br>‶Aunt Lissa?‶ Lucina shouted, her face more scarlet than ever.<br><br>‶Oh my goodness…‶ another familiar voice said from behind. Lucina was getting very tired of this… When she turned around, her eyes went wide at the sight of the worst people possible: Her father Chrom and her mother Sumia!<br><br>‶Mother?! Father?!‶ Lucina yelled, now thoroughly humiliated.<br><br>‶What are you doing out here naked?‶ Chrom asked, puzzled and concerned.<br><br>‶I don't know, I-‶ Lucina started to explain, but was interrupted by her Aunt Lissa pinching her exposed butt. ‶Eep!‶ she squeaked, reaching back with both hands to defend her posterior, and inadvertently leaving her full frontal nudity completely uncovered.<br><br><br><br>With Lissa at her rear, Olivia and Robin at her sides, and Chrom and Sumia in front of her, Lucina was totally surrounded and totally naked. Overwhelmed and unsure of what to do, she simply froze.<br><br>‶Poor dear…‶ Sumia said with pity, ‶It seems your bust really never came in, did it?‶<br><br>Lucina moved her hands to her chest, covering a nipple with each hand.<br><br>‶It also seems you inherited my hair color all over…‶ Chrom remarked, having noticed the vibrant blue hair above his daughter's most private area.<br><br>Panicked, Lucina then reprioritized by covering her crotch with both hands.<br><br>‶A warrior should know to never leave her flank vulnerable!‶ Lissa shouted before delivering a swift slap to Lucina's bare bottom.<br><br>‶Gah!‶ Lucina squealed, leaping forward nearly a meter.<br><br>‶How embarrassing…‶ Olivia commented, unable to stop staring at the spectacle before her.<br><br>‶Indeed…‶ Robin followed up, also mesmerized by the naked swordswoman.<br><br>So many eyes on her… Her closest friends and family, seeing every part of her body and noticing everything that made her insecure… Her heart pounded, her legs shook, all words escaped her… This was…<br><br><br><br>Lucina opened her eyes, blinking slowly a few times until she gained focus. She was lying on something soft… in the dark?<br><br>‶A dream… Of course,‶ Lucina thought as she took a deep breath and eased into consciousness. ‶None of it was real… Only a dream…‶ she told herself.<br><br>When she looked down, however, she found that at least one aspect of the dream had been reflected by reality. She didn't have any clothes on, and only her lower half was hidden by her blanket. Had she forgotten to get dressed in her nightgown before getting into bed?<br><br>She placed a hand on her chest, and found that her heart was racing, and that her nipples were erect. ‶I suppose it was a bit of an exciting dream, wasn't it?‶ she thought with a little grin.<br><br>Lucina threw her covers off herself, now even more excited at the sight of her own full nudity. She was just waking up, but it seemed her private regions were already begging for her attention. ‶So soon, after last night?‶<br><br>Judging by the lack of sunlight, it was very early in the morning. ‶Now is as good a time as any…‶ Lucina thought to herself, letting her fingers make their way down her toned belly, her lower abdomen, and then…<br><br>…<br><br>Lucina breathed heavily as she came down from the pleasure high she'd just given herself. It had taken all her willpower to keep quiet during the most intense moments.<br><br>She pivoted into an upright seated position on the edge of the bed, and stood up to stretch out. She nearly lost her balance once or twice, as her legs were still trembling.<br><br>Looking towards the tent's entrance, Lucina noticed there appeared to be some light peeking in at last. She walked over and carefully poked only her head through the flaps, curious about what time it was. As she suspected, the earliest hints of sunrise were present in the deep blue sky and cool morning air.<br><br>The breeze felt so nice on her warm cheeks, and the sounds of the chirping birds were so lovely! Lucina thought a walk might be nice. She just had to get dressed first… Or did she?<br><br><br><br>Lucina began blushing again at the thought of taking a nature walk in her most natural state. The air would feel just wonderful all over her body, and letting her nakedness show for the world to see would be so exciting…<br><br>Lucina forced herself to stop fantasizing before she got herself all worked up again, and pulled her head back into her tent. ‶As much as I'd love to go out like this, I'd better get dressed,‶ she murmured to herself as she went to fetch her clothes.<br><br>She donned her stretchy leggings and a dark-colored, form-fitting, long-sleeved top, as well as some comfortable boots. She also took Falchion, holstered on her back in case of an emergency, and stepped outside into the refreshing early morning air.<br><br><br><br>By now, it was just light enough to see without issue, so it was the perfect time for a morning stroll. Lucina took long, deep breaths as she walked around just outside the Shepherd encampment, savoring the natural smell of the grass, and the drops of dew which had formed upon it.<br><br>Such a pleasant morning in this safe, peaceful world was a luxury for which Lucina had fought tirelessly, and one which she never took for granted. She couldn't help but smile as she let the beauty and serenity of her environment soak in.<br><br>And yet, even in such a tranquil, relaxing moment, the lewd thoughts began creeping in once more. Lucina couldn't help but be reminded of her dream, in which she stood in a rather similar setting while her friends and family stared unyielding at her naked body.<br><br>Lucina blushed in spite of the cool air, her mind replaying the scenario she'd invented in her sleep. ‶Wouldn't it be good fun to recreate my dream?‶ she internally teased herself, letting out a little laugh. She was only joking, of course, though she was entirely alone… Naturally, this led to Lucina wondering if she could get away with being a little naughty.<br><br><br><br>Lucina looked around carefully, and all she saw were the empty plains, the edge of the nearby forest, and her home base, from which she was pretty far by now. There wasn't a person in her sight, meaning there was likely no one to see her either.<br><br>Her heart rate increased as she got an idea. It was a little risky, but surely she wouldn't be caught, right? She'd braved bandits, murderers, evil dictators, the undead, dragons… She could certainly be brave enough to do this.<br><br>Lucina took a quick breath before giving in to her perverted impulses and pulling down the rear of her pants, exposing her naked buttocks. She giggled as she felt the chill of the morning air on her newly bare cheeks, and instinctively quickened her pace a little.<br><br>Her mind now racing as fast as her heart, she began to daydream as she continued her stroll around the camp. She imagined a scenario wherein she was walking around unaware that her butt was uncovered. ‶Lucina… I don't know how to tell you this, but…‶ imaginary Robin said, embarrassed and shocked by what he was looking at. ‶Ha! I love the new look, Lucina!‶ Anna called. ‶Huh? I'm not sure what you mean… You're all acting a bit strange!‶ Lucina said quietly to herself. The thought of giving everyone in the Shepherds a show without even realizing, and the humiliation that would follow when she realized what had happened… The idea was really turning her on.<br><br><br><br>Lucina's fantasizing was interrupted, however, by an all-too-familiar sound. She drew her blade from her back in the blink of an eye, and turned to face the threat: a small group of Risen approaching from the forest. There were three or four, from what Lucina could gather. She was outnumbered, but that had never stopped her before.<br><br>She charged forth, Falchion at her side, and decapitated the first creature with a swift slash. As its body evaporated into a sickly mist, the others quickly moved towards her.<br><br>The agile warrior princess assumed a defensive stance, ready to take on however many Risen could appear. She kept her distance and delivered a merciless thrust to one creature's chest, hopping backwards afterwards to avoid an attack from its ferocious colleague. Lucina made quick work of this assailant, as well as the one that followed in its wake.<br><br>There appeared to be more coming from the dark woods, possibly enough to overwhelm even the greatest swordswoman fighting alone. This had quickly turned bad, Lucina thought. She couldn't retreat to camp, since leading these monsters to her base where all the Shepherds were asleep would result in disaster. However, Lucina knew that there could be grave danger in taking on all these Risen without help. This was a difficult situation she'd been caught in…<br><br><br><br>Suddenly, Lucina heard her name called from behind her in a deep voice. It was Frederick, riding in on his armored horse with a fearsome weapon in hand.<br><br>Lucina had never been so happy to see him! She gave him a nod of understanding, and took the left group of Risen, dispatching them one by one.<br><br><br><br>After a few minutes of careful combat, Lucina and Frederick had taken out all the undead forces.<br><br>‶Is that all of them?‶ Frederick asked, a little out of breath.<br><br>‶I think so,‶ Lucina replied, working to regulate her breathing as well. ‶Thank you so much. I'm so glad you came along,‶ she said with great relief and appreciation.<br><br>‶We're very lucky we caught them before they reached our camp,‶ Frederick said, gazing out towards the forest with tense anticipation.<br><br>‶Definitely,‶ Lucina agreed, trying not to think about what would have happened had everyone still been asleep.<br><br>‶If you want to hop aboard, I'll give you a ride back,‶ Frederick offered, patting the large saddle of his metal-clad steed.<br><br>‶I'd appreciate that,‶ Lucina said with a smile, a bit exhausted after the unexpected battle. She lifted herself up onto Frederick's horse, and felt an unusual cold sensation as she took her seat.<br><br>‶Oh no…‶ Lucina thought, her heart sinking at the realization. She'd forgotten to pull her pants up! Blushing fiercely, she adjusted the leggings accordingly and sat quietly for the next minute or so until they reached the camp. Her fantasy had potentially come to life…<br><br><br><br>‶Thank you again for everything, Frederick,‶ Lucina said earnestly as she dismounted the armored horse. ‶Are you sure you don't need any company?‶ she asked the hulking knight.<br><br>‶No, thank you, Lucina, I'll stand guard alone. You should get some more rest. From what I saw, you took out a small army of those things all alone,‶ Frederick complimented.<br><br>‶I could have been in real trouble if you hadn't come along. Thank you again,‶ Lucina said with a warm grin.<br><br>‶Rest well, Lucina,‶ Frederick said, a subtle smile adorning his stoic face.<br><br><br><br>Lucina made her way back to her tent rather quickly, and flopped onto her bed immediately once she got inside.<br><br>‶Uuuugghhh…‶ she moaned into her mattress. ‶Did Frederick just see my bare butt?‶ she wondered, feeling her face going terribly red. ‶Maybe he was too focused on the Risen to notice. He certainly wasn't acting like he saw… Though, knowing him, of course he wouldn't act like he saw… Ugh, I'm never gonna know…‶ <br><br>Lucina imagined Frederick's point of view, of her walking around alone with her backside exposed, and then even taking on Risen like that. ‶I must have looked ridiculous… I hope he didn't notice… Gods, I'm so embarrassed… About how one of the Shepherds' mightiest warriors might have just seen my big, round, fully naked bottom… So, so, so embarrassed…‶ Lucina let out a sigh as she rolled onto her back and pulled her pants down. ‶Time for round 2, I suppose…‶ she said with a smile as her fingers reached her privates." },
      { title: "Chapter 4", summary: "First Streak", content: "Following a very exciting morning, Lucina spent the remainder of her day following the typical routines: A little training, a little patrolling, some chores here and there… Although it was a bit mundane, Lucina coasted through it with a smile, deeply at ease that she'd succeeded in her mission, and had made a real difference. The world was healing, evil was diminishing, and true peace was growing ever closer with each day. From Lucina's point of view, none of it would have been possible without the Shepherds, her greatest and closest friends… many of whom she was too embarrassed to speak with for the time being.<br><br>Lucina felt her cheeks turn red whenever Frederick passed by, and her heart skipped a beat every time she saw Olivia. Being around Ricken reminded her of the incident at the bathing tent, and even Robin, Lissa, and her parents made her think about her humiliating dream she'd just had.<br><br>As a result, Lucina had been keeping to herself throughout the day. She worried that spending time around certain people could bring out blushing, loss of focus, nervous speech patterns and the like. Lucina had elected to chop wood at the edge of camp until sunset, where she hoped she could be alone and recover from all the excitement.<br><br><br><br>For Lucina, chopping wood was easy, tranquil work. It didn't require much thought, and was not at all physically strenuous with the right technique. Throughout the hour or two Lucina spent on this menial task, she occupied herself with idle thoughts and daydreams. She thought of past battles, the battles that lay ahead, the people she'd met, the bonds she'd formed, the experiences she'd shared…<br><br>As much as she tried to resist it, though, her mind kept returning to more recent and arousing events. ‶Ricken almost saw… Frederick probably saw… Olivia definitely saw everything…‶ she thought, her face becoming flushed as she stacked firewood in neat piles. ‶At least it's all over now… Right?‶ Lucina thought.<br><br>She couldn't lie to herself, however. Deep down, she knew she was disappointed by the idea of something like that never happening again. ‶I think… I'd like to be seen again…‶ Lucina admitted, letting a little smile form between her soft lips.<br><br>‶But how to go about it? Should I fabricate a situation where someone will walk in on me? Perhaps that could work best, if I do it just right. I can't exactly just show myself off… I'd never live it down if they could tell it was on purpose. Unless… Maybe if… they couldn't see my face…‶ <br><br>Lucina hadn't been paying much attention, and was brought back into the moment by the loud sound of one of her firewood stacks collapsing. It was apparent to her now that she'd built it terribly unevenly. ‶Guess I should pay more attention,‶ she thought with a little chuckle, and got down on her hands and knees to rearrange the scattered slices of wood.<br><br>Quickly, though, her mind traveled to thoughts of nudity and exposure once more. These steamy thoughts were making her heart race even during this most lackluster of chores…<br><br><br><br>‶I can see you're hard at work,‶ a masculine voice said from behind.<br><br>Lucina shot up right away, and turned quickly around with a hand across her chest and the other on her crotch. ‶You can see my what?‶ she asked in a panic.<br><br>She looked up and made eye contact with her visitor, who turned out to be Robin. Lucina began blushing as she realized how foolish she must look at the moment, seated in the grass with her arms wrapped around herself.<br><br>‶I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,‶ Robin said with a warm smile. ‶I just said you seem to be hard at work, with all this firewood you've gotten chopped,‶ he explained.<br><br>‶Oh, um, thank you. I've been at it for a while,‶ Lucina said, rising to her feet. The memories of her sexy dream promptly began to creep in, but she did her best to push them away and have a normal conversation with the brilliant tactician she so admired.<br><br>‶I heard you took out some Risen this morning as well,‶ Robin began.<br><br>Lucina gulped quickly. Frederick had reported it, of course… But had he told anyone the finer details? Regarding the bare bottom he may or may not have seen?<br><br>‶They're still around, but I think they're becoming scarcer,‶ Robin said optimistically.<br><br>‶Yes, I agree,‶ Lucina replied, wanting to muster a quick response despite her mind being occupied with other things.<br><br>‶We've come so far. And we couldn't have done it without you,‶ Robin praised.<br><br>Lucina was certain she was blushing by now, but hoped it wasn't showing. ‶I could say the same to you,‶ she replied with a smile.<br><br>‶It's getting late, so I wanted to ask if you needed some help getting these over to storage,‶ Robin offered politely.<br><br>‶Oh! You're right, perhaps this is enough for one day,‶ Lucina commented, looking over at the enormous piles of wood she'd cut. ‶Thank you. I really appreciate it,‶ she said gratefully, and the two began carrying the logs to the encampment's storage facilities.<br><br><br><br>By the time Lucina and Robin were finished, the sun had mostly set and night had begun to fall, so the two said goodnight and retired to their private tents.<br><br>Feeling pretty tired out, Lucina tied her tent's flaps closed, removed her sweaty clothing, and lay naked on her bed. Now that she was truly alone, with her work for the day finished, Lucina had the freedom to let all the naughty thoughts occupy her mind.<br><br>She moved her right hand between her thighs, and began rubbing herself as she delved deeper into the ideas and fantasies that had been brewing in her head. There had been so much excitement recently, with multiple close friends having seen her fully or partially naked.<br><br>For Lucina, however, dwelling on the past wasn't enough. She wanted more. And given her aroused state and excited mood, she wanted it as soon as possible.<br><br>She turned her head and looked over at the tent entrance, imagining Robin opening the flaps and catching her like this, masturbating completely naked on her bed. The idea was so deliciously stimulating; Lucina wondered if she could make it happen somehow. Invite someone to come in, only for her to be stark-naked and playing with herself as they entered? It was too obvious… As wonderful as it would feel in the moment, there was no way she could do something that would so clearly out her as an exhibitionist.<br><br><br><br>Lucina then remembered something she'd considered earlier: What if she could show her body, but not show her face? She was no stranger to wearing a mask, and even had multiple masks in her private effects which none of the other Shepherds had ever seen.<br><br>The problem with a mask was that, although it covered her face, it would leave her recognizable hair uncovered. Lucina pondered on this for a moment before remembering she owned a small hooded cloak, which reached just below her shoulder blades. If she were to wear this, it would keep her head fully covered, while rendering most everything below the neck entirely exposed, unlike a full-length cloak.<br><br>Lucina's heart began pounding even faster than it already was, and she felt a tingling sensation throughout her entire body. This could actually work… She could don this hood and a mask, and nothing else, and run as fast as she could through the camp in hopes that someone would catch a glimpse of her naked body. Her plump buttocks, her royal womanhood, the pink nipples at the centers of her tiny breasts, all of it. The mere idea made Lucina want to melt. It was so overwhelmingly enticing, she wasn't certain she could resist.<br><br><br><br>A stunt like this would require careful planning, perfect execution, and plenty of good luck. ‶Now I know how Robin feels…‶ Lucina thought with a smile.<br><br>In spite of being horny and impatient, she began ruminating on exactly what she wanted to do, and how she could do it. She decided that the best plan was to sneak out to the far corner of the encampment, hiding in the shadows all the while, and then dash as quickly as possible through camp back to her tent. The most major risk was being followed back to her tent, but it was a risk worth taking, especially if she could run fast enough.<br><br>Lucina's heart was racing, and she couldn't wait any longer. She stopped rubbing herself, got up from the bed, and headed over to her storage chest to retrieve the cloak and a mask. The mask she chose was jet-black, same as the hood, and was tall and wide enough to hide her entire face.<br><br>Putting the articles on and taking a look in the mirror, Lucina thought she looked perfect. This was it. The time had come. Her plan was in place, she was dressed just right, and all that stood between her nudity and the outside world was the fabric of her tent.<br><br>She carefully poked her head through the entrance, and found that the coast was clear. ‶Okay, Lucina, you can do this… You can go out there… Naked… And show everybody your privates… Your flat chest… Big butt… Everything!‶ Rapidly breathing and violently quaking from head to toe, Lucina separated the flaps of her tent and stepped outside into the autumn night.<br><br><br><br>‶I'm doing it! Gods, I'm doing it! I'm naked in the camp! Oh, goodness, I need to hide…‶ Lucina thought before scurrying behind her tent. As incredibly excited and aroused as she was, sticking to the plan and remaining out of sight for the time being was of great importance. She had only just begun the first phase, which entailed scouting the camp whilst moving towards her destination. ‶No time to waste!‶ Lucina thought as she began stepping delicately behind the long row of private tents.<br><br>The feeling was entirely surreal. The mossy ground beneath her bare feet, the dim light of the moon on her bare skin, the slightly chilly air tickling her private parts… It all felt like she was having a lovely, sensual dream again. The temptation to continue playing with herself was quite strong, but Lucina's resolve was stronger, and she decided to fight back until the time was right.<br><br><br><br>Lucina had reached the first corner of camp before long, and was about halfway to her goal. Since she was approaching the more social part of camp where her comrades were most likely to be relaxing or working together, she knew she needed to tread carefully.<br><br>She peered around the tent she was using for cover, and could see a small fire with a handful of soldiers sitting around it. She couldn't pick out any faces from this distance, so she knew she'd be finding out when the time came.<br><br>After a quick glance left and right, Lucina dashed across the open area at the camp's corner, and hid behind the first of the next row of tents. Her chest was thumping rapidly, and she was still shaky all over. ‶I wonder if my body can even handle all this excitement…‶ Lucina wondered with a naughty smirk.<br><br><br><br>At this time, another sensation came to her attention, and a rather disconcerting one at that: She feared her bladder was in need of relief. She had been so distracted by everything else, it had crept up on her.<br><br>‶Ohh, not now… And I'm sure my nerves aren't helping…‶ Lucina thought, her level of stress increasing. ‶Should I keep moving forward? Or should I maybe go back, and do this another night? Or… Since I'm outdoors… With no clothes to worry about…‶ Lucina began blushing as it dawned on her. ‶I could just… Go right here and now, couldn't I?‶<br><br>Something about the idea was quite attractive to Lucina. Relieving herself, out in the open, fully nude, like an absolute deviant. Certainly that was no way for a princess to behave… What if someone were to catch her like that? So completely vulnerable, with all dignity thrown to the wind? It would be unbelievably humiliating… Which meant that Lucina's mind was made up.<br><br>She took off her mask, and pulled back her hood, making it clearly visible that she was unmistakably the one and only Lucina. With a mischievous expression on her face, she lowered herself to a crouch and relaxed, and it was only matter of seconds before she was doing the unthinkable.<br><br>‶Eehee! I can't believe I'm doing this! Peeing! Outside! Naked!~‶ Lucina squealed internally. As the next several seconds went by, she watched and listened carefully for anyone who might approach and catch her in this shameful act of exhibitionism. She was able to finish without being seen, though, which secretly disappointed her a little. She was reassured by the fact that she'd soon be running past a group of her friends in the nude, all of them likely gawking at her assets. Unable to wait, and not wanting to waste time, Lucina set her mask and hood in place once more and continued toward the camp's far corner.<br><br><br><br>The bare princess stepped quietly along behind the bathing tents, the big moment drawing ever closer. Her heart was thumping, her mouth was dry, and she was beginning to feel as though she could hardly stand.<br><br>‶I just can't believe this is really happening… I'm walking through our camp with everything but my face exposed… It's really like a dream! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I charge past the fire pit…‶ <br><br>Lucina's breathing was fast and hot. She had nearly reached the far corner, where she would soon enter the actual camp rather than continue hiding in the outskirts. The stealthy journey to the starting point was at its end, and her daring streak was about to begin.<br><br>She crept along the rear wall of the final tent, and cautiously peeked around the corner. It appeared that no one was around, which meant that she'd have a good runway to get up to full speed before sprinting past the fire pit. From there, she could make her way toward the living quarters where her private tent was located.<br><br>It was now or never… Lucina took a deep breath and darted out from behind her cover, nothing below the neck hidden from view as she sped down the path.<br><br><br><br>Lucina couldn't help but smile as her plan came to life. She was running naked through camp, for real! The wind caressed her every contour as she raced onward, adrenaline powering her legs to their maximum potential.<br><br>She had made such progress so quickly, it was nearly time to turn the corner and pass the fire pit. This was it. Whoever was sitting around that fire would all get to see Lucina's naked body. ‶All of it… My oh-so-flat chest, my rotund rear end, my blue patch above my little lady lips…‶ Lucina thought as she ran.<br><br>In no time at all, she'd reached the corner, and could already hear murmuring voices as she made her turn. There they were! People! Her friends! And here she was, wearing nothing but a mask and hood! Although her identity was protected, everything else was revealed! Revealed to whom, though? Just as Lucina got close enough to begin recognizing faces, those faces began to take notice of her.<br><br>‶Whoa!‶ Stahl shouted, his eyes going wide.<br><br>Everyone else in the group immediately shifted their focus toward whatever it was Stahl was seeing, and were shocked to find a naked person heading toward them at breakneck speed.<br><br>‶What in the-‶ Donnel began, flabbergasted by the sight before him.<br><br>‶Heheeyy, alright!‶ Sully cheered on with a smile, greatly entertained by the unexpected streaker.<br><br>Miriel raised her palm to her face in irritated silence.<br><br><br><br>‶They're looking… They're really looking! Staring, unblinking, at my naked body!‶ Lucina shouted internally as she scanned each of her comrades' faces.<br><br>Last but not least was Olivia, who stared on in shock.<br><br>‶Oh, no… Olivia is here? This could be bad,‶ Lucina thought, gritting her teeth. She watched carefully to read her reaction.<br><br>At first, it seemed to just be the general surprise and embarrassment one would expect from Olivia in a situation like this. However, as these lengthy few seconds passed by, it seemed Olivia's expression evolved. It was an expression of confused curiosity, the face of a woman who recognized what she was seeing, but couldn't believe it.<br><br>‶Damn it. She knows,‶ Lucina thought as she sprinted away from the group, who whistled and cheered at the sight of her naked backside.<br><br><br><br>The blue-haired warrior ran as quickly as she could back to her tent. Fortunately, there was no one near the entrance, so she was able to slip inside without issue. She fastened the ties shut as fast as possible, tossed the mask and cloak aside, and flopped down onto her bed.<br><br>‶Uuuugghh… Olivia surely knew it was me…‶ Lucina lamented, her face buried in her pillow. ‶That look on her face… She definitely recognized my flat chest, and my blue hair, and then probably even my rear end when I ran away…‶ Lucina thought.<br><br>‶Maybe not, maybe I'm just imagining things… Either way… Everyone else seemed to love it!‶ Lucina reassured herself, rolling onto her back and smiling. Her adrenaline high had not worn thin in the slightest, and her breathing and heartbeat were still at a high pace.<br><br>‶Stahl was so shocked, and Donnel looked like he was seeing a ghost… Sully even cheered for me! They all did! Except Miriel, of course, but she's Miriel…‶ Lucina celebrated.<br><br>‶Oh, gods… Naked… They saw me totally naked…‶ Lucina couldn't resist reaching down between her thighs. ‶This'll be a good one…‶ she thought, spreading her legs wide.<br><br>‶Uhm… Uh… Lucina?‶ Suddenly, a voice came from just outside the tent. Lucina knew the voice well, and hearing it at a time like this made her heart skip a beat, as it had before.<br><br>It was Olivia." },
      { title: "Chapter 5", summary: "Naked and Bold", content: "Lucina froze up with anxiety. She lay fully nude on her bed with her hand resting on her crotch and her head turned toward the entrance to her tent, wondering how to respond to Olivia's voice. There was no mistaking it now… Olivia had recognized Lucina during her naked run, and had come to confront her!<br><br>‶What do I do? What do I say?‶ Lucina thought, but time was short. She needed to give a response quickly. ‶Just a moment! I'm not quite decent!‶ she called out as she began scrambling for something to put on. The swordswoman grabbed the first thing she laid eyes on, her form-fitting innerwear, and pulled it on as quickly as she could before approaching the front of her tent.<br><br>Lucina felt like she could throw up, or simply die from embarrassment and stress. How in the world was she going to face Olivia? Surely she was as red in the face as could be, and trembling all over. Hiding her flushed and anxious state would be impossible.<br><br>‶Damn it all… How could I be so stupid? I've gotten myself into a terrible mess… Now I need to face the consequences…‶ Lucina thought as she reached the entrance. She untied the knot which kept her and Olivia separated, and pulled apart the flaps to face her friend.<br><br><br><br>Olivia's eyes were wide, and she looked a little pale. The two stared at each other silently, both clearly in a fluster.<br><br>‶Um, what brings you here, Olivia?‶ Lucina asked with a shaky smile, doing her best to feign a calm demeanor.<br><br>‶I, umm… Well…‶ Olivia began, her cheeks beginning to burn. ‶Ah… A few of us were sitting around the fire pit, and… There was… Someone ran by, and they…‶ Olivia did her best to explain, but was having trouble speaking.<br><br>Tension built within Lucina as her skin began to crawl and her stomach began to sink even lower. If she was going to smooth things over, there was no way it could happen quickly, so she thought inviting Olivia inside might be for the best.<br><br>‶Um, would you like to come in? Maybe you could sit down and tell me about it,‶ Lucina offered, in spite of her survival instincts begging her to run away and hide from everyone.<br><br>‶O-Okay…‶ Olivia squeaked, obviously terribly nervous and shaken. As the pink-haired dancer stepped inside, Lucina tied the tent flaps shut behind her.<br><br>‶Let's sit on the bed,‶ Lucina said, dedicating all her strength to keeping composed. Olivia quietly took her seat on the bed, and Lucina joined her a moment after.<br><br>There was another period of deafening, crushing silence, wherein both girls' minds raced while their lips remained sealed. Lucina knew that only she could break this silence, and began pondering over how to phrase what she was about to say. Her heart was pounding, her mouth was dry, and she felt as though she couldn't breathe, but she knew she had to remain strong.<br><br>‶Olivia…‶ she began, looking her friend in the eyes. ‶The person you saw, the one who ran past you… It was me,‶ she admitted, looking shamefully at the floor.<br><br><br><br>The tent was engulfed in silence once again following Lucina's blunt revelation. Time seemed to stand still for eons as Lucina waited for Olivia's reaction.<br><br>‶I know,‶ Olivia said quietly after a hard swallow.<br><br>Lucina felt like she'd just been hit with Elthunder as shame and regret washed over her body.<br><br>‶I recognized you… from before. I just… wanted to make sure you're okay,‶ Olivia said, a worried tone overlaying her shaky voice.<br><br>‶Okay?‶ Lucina repeated curiously, turning her gaze slightly sideways toward her friend.<br><br>‶I wanted to know if you'd been cursed, or if you were made to run around like that for some other reason. If someone forced you to do something so embarrassing, I want to know about it,‶ Olivia said, her resolve showing through her blush.<br><br>Lucina wasn't sure what to say. Should she claim she was hexed, as part of a prank? Telling a lie like that would be really unfair to Olivia, who would no doubt be on the hunt for the culprit… She could tell Olivia it was a dare, but this would naturally lead to the question of who gave the dare. Lying to her friends wasn't something Lucina ever wanted to do, but the truth might end her friendship with Olivia. ‶What have I done…?‶ Lucina asked herself, still lost in thought.<br><br><br><br>Lucina suddenly felt a hand on her knee. She looked up at Olivia, and the two locked eyes.<br><br>‶You can tell me,‶ Olivia said, a plethora of emotions emanating from her pink face.<br><br>Based on the physical contact and her facial expression, it was clear to Lucina that Olivia was serious, and determined to know the truth. ‶She's so worried about me… She wants to know everything, for my sake. How could I lie to her? But how could I tell her the truth? The truth… The truth is…‶ Lucina thought, her ability to keep a straight face slipping away as she stared into her friend's eyes.<br><br>She bit her lips, and she felt her face becoming hotter as tears began to well. Olivia promptly wrapped her arms around Lucina, who couldn't help but sob quietly over her shoulder. Olivia said nothing, allowing a few tears of her own to fall in silence.<br><br>‶I'm sorry, Lucina. Whoever it was, we'll confront them together. No one has the right to make-‶ Olivia comforted, but Lucina interrupted by pulling away.<br><br>‶No… It's not that…‶ Lucina said with a sniffle. She turned and looked at the floor again. She knew that hiding from the truth would only make matters worse, and that coming clean was the only course of action. ‶It was just me. I did it all on my own, for my… I'm just some… sick…‶ Lucina confessed before beginning to cry again.<br><br><br><br>Olivia was shocked and confused, but held Lucina tightly nonetheless.<br><br>‶I'm… I'm sorry, Olivia… I'm disgusting…‶ Lucina sputtered between sobs.<br><br>Olivia hugged more tightly as she consoled her friend. ‶You are beautiful inside and out, Lucina,‶ she reassured.<br><br>‶You don't… think less of me?‶ Lucina asked, touched by Olivia's compassion.<br><br>‶No. I may not understand exactly why you did that, but… It would never make me think less of you,‶ Olivia comforted.<br><br>Lucina let out one last stream of tears before taking a few deep breaths and calming herself down. She did her best to dry her eyes as she receded from Olivia's caring embrace.<br><br><br><br>‶I suppose I should explain myself further,‶ Lucina said, feeling a bit more collected.<br><br>Olivia offered no response other than blushing.<br><br>‶For some time, I've been dealing with some insecurity regarding my body. My bottom stands out, and I don't have a full chest like the other women,‶ Lucina began explaining.<br><br>‶Oh, Lucina…‶ Olivia interjected with a sad expression.<br><br>‶Don't worry, I'm starting to get better about that, and learning to love my own body more,‶ Lucina said with a little grin.<br><br>Olivia smiled back in relief, and continued listening.<br><br>‶I still get embarrassed, though, as I'm sure you remember from yesterday,‶ Lucina reminisced, making Olivia a bit more flushed in the cheeks. ‶When that happened, I discovered something about myself. It's hard to explain why, but… I quite like that feeling of embarrassment that comes with someone seeing my body fully unclothed like that,‶ Lucina admitted, her heart thumping furiously from the sheer thrill of confiding in Olivia her darkest secret.<br><br><br><br>Olivia seemed rather confused. ‶You like feeling embarrassed? For me, being embarrassed is just… embarrassing!‶ Olivia said with a cute smile.<br><br>‶Well, it is! I was terribly embarrassed when you saw everything,‶ Lucina clarified with a grin, her cheeks turning redder.<br><br>Olivia's face was positively scarlet as the memory replayed itself in her head.<br><br>‶It's just that that type of embarrassment is, well… exciting, in a way,‶ Lucina described with a bit of a sensual expression.<br><br>‶Exciting?‶ Olivia asked innocently.<br><br>‶Exciting, as in… Arousing,‶ Lucina said a bit more bluntly.<br><br>‶Oh my…‶ Olivia said, covering her mouth with both hands as she realized what Lucina meant.<br><br>‶I've never talked about anything like this with another person before,‶ Lucina thought, captivated by this oddly cathartic feeling.<br><br>‶So you went out and ran around… n-naked… tonight, because… it's exciting for you?‶ Olivia asked, looking at her hands and twiddling her fingers.<br><br>‶That's right,‶ Lucina confirmed, almost with a sense of pride.<br><br>‶So… You put on the mask to hide your identity, but let everyone see everything else?‶ Olivia asked, her face still red.<br><br>‶Yes. Although your presence was… an unexpected complication,‶ Lucina said.<br><br>‶Mhm…‶ Olivia murmured quietly, recalling what she'd seen. ‶How far did you go? How long were you out without your clothes, I mean?‶ Olivia asked.<br><br>Lucina was surprised by Olivia's ability to continue such an inappropriate conversation. ‶Well…‶ Lucina began, and told her friend the entire story.<br><br><br><br>…<br><br><br><br>‶That's unbelievable!‶ Olivia proclaimed in amazement as Lucina finished her story.<br><br>Lucina smiled shyly, kicking her feet and smiling a little.<br><br>‶How you made it so far with nothing hiding your body, and how you relieved yourself out in the open, and then appeared before your friends completely… nude…‶ Olivia summarized, blushing all the while.<br><br>Lucina began recalling each feeling of every moment in intimate detail, and had to fight off arousal.<br><br>‶How did that feel?‶ Olivia asked, unable to imagine going through with something so bold.<br><br>‶It was… Thrilling, exciting, freeing in a way… My hands are still tingling,‶ Lucina said, holding out a shaky hand for her friend to observe.<br><br>‶Goodness… I wish I were as brave as you,‶ Olivia said with a dreamy smile.<br><br>‶You wish you could run around camp with no clothes on?‶ Lucina teased.<br><br>‶No, no, no! I could never, not in a thousand years!‶ Olivia retorted, burying her face in her hands.<br><br>Lucina giggled and gave Olivia a few gentle pats on the back.<br><br>‶What I mean to say is that… I'm a dancer, and showing off my figure is important for my work. I wish I weren't so shy about exposure,‶ Olivia wistfully expressed.<br><br>Lucina gave an understanding smile. ‶You have nothing to be shy about, Olivia. You have a wonderful body,‶ Lucina complimented.<br><br>‶Th-Thank you… It's not so much that, though. It's just that I get so embarrassed by exposed skin, whether it's mine, or someone else's. That's no secret, though,‶ Olivia explained with a chuckle.<br><br>‶It might be something you could get used to over time. Desensitized, in a way,‶ Lucina posited.<br><br>‶How do you mean?‶ Olivia asked.<br><br>‶Well, you could try to get more comfortable in your own skin, or being exposed to exposed skin,‶ Lucina elaborated.<br><br>‶I could maybe try that… Spending more time alone with less clothing on could help. I'm not sure about how to get comfortable being exposed to others' exposed skin though. That's even more embarrassing than my own skin,‶ Olivia said quizzically.<br><br>This gave Lucina a scandalous idea. She was quite worked up by now, and spent no time questioning whether to voice it to Olivia. ‶Maybe you and I could… take off our clothes and just relax. I don't mind if you see me nude, so I could always help you get used to the idea of exposure. In my case, it's nothing you haven't seen before, right?‶ Lucina offered happily.<br><br><br><br>Olivia nearly went into convulsions upon hearing this proposal. ‶You and I, take off our clothes in front of each other?! That would be… Oh my goodness…‶ the pink-haired girl stammered frantically.<br><br>‶See? Your reaction is all the more reason to go through with it!‶ Lucina contended playfully.<br><br>Olivia sat quietly, too embarrassed to muster a response.<br><br>‶We're both girls, and we're close friends, so there's nothing wrong with it. I won't make you do anything, of course, but I think it'd help,‶ Lucina stated genuinely.<br><br>‶You may be right, but…‶ Olivia said, resting her hand against her lips.<br><br>‶How about if I take my clothes off, and if it's too much, I'll put them back on?‶ Lucina suggested.<br><br>Olivia sat and gave this some thought. She really did wish to be less uncomfortable with nakedness, and it was quite possible that desensitization could be a great first step. It was also true that she had seen Lucina, a close friend, in the nude before.<br><br>‶If I want to grow, I need to do things outside my comfort zone… I've fought battle after battle and risked my life time and time again, but this is too much? No… No, I can handle this… I know I can!‶ Olivia thought. She stood up from the bed and took a few steps toward the tent's exit.<br><br>‶Is she leaving? I put too much pressure on her… I let my perverse nature get the better of my judgment again…‶ Lucina thought, disappointed in herself. To her shock, however, Olivia appeared to be removing her clothing.<br><br><br><br>The dancer faced away from Lucina as she started taking off her armbands. ‶I'm not as timid and shy as people perceive… I can be bold, and fearless, like you, Lucina…‶ she thought as she stepped out of her legwear. All that covered her at this point was her cloth one-piece which left little to the imagination.<br><br>Lucina sat speechless, watching in awe as the most introverted person she knew removed all her clothes right before her eyes.<br><br>Olivia's entire body quaked violently as she readied herself to discard her final article of clothing. ‶If Lucina can walk around naked… Then I can too!‶ she thought as she displaced her shoulder straps and let the garment slide down to the floor.<br><br>Olivia stood rigid with her eyes closed and her breath held as Lucina stared in admiration at her curvaceous naked backside.<br><br>‶Gods above, what a perfect shape…‶ Lucina thought. She realized then that she hadn't spoken since Olivia stood up, and that she ought to say something.<br><br>‶Olivia, I… This is… incredibly bold of you!‶ she praised.<br><br>Olivia slowly turned around and faced Lucina, her hands covering her nipples and crotch. Lucina thought Olivia looked like she was ready to cry, but was also proud of herself for doing something so daring. The swordswoman did her best not to stare at Olivia's incredible form, which was slender and toned and smooth at every turn.<br><br><br><br>‶Umm… I might… feel a little more comfortable if… If you were to…‶ Olivia began, her speech just as shaky as her legs.<br><br>‶Oh! Oh, of course!‶ Lucina interjected before standing up to strip off her clothes as well.<br><br>Olivia watched as Lucina's flat chest, plump buttocks, and iconic blue patch all came into view as she stripped.<br><br>Lucina then stood about a meter in front of Olivia, letting nothing be hidden from her view.<br><br>‶Naked… Both of us, fully naked… I can see Lucina's everything, and she can see everything I'm not covering… This is insanity… It's so improper… It's my worst nightmare, and yet… It's okay. I… feel okay,‶ Olivia thought as she looked at Lucina's smiling face.<br><br>‶How do you feel?‶ Lucina asked warmly.<br><br>‶I… This is… not so bad,‶ Olivia replied, grinning in spite of her nerves.<br><br>‶See? I knew you could do it!‶ Lucina commended, taking a step forward.<br><br>This compliment invigorated Olivia, who knew it was time to take the final leap and let her hands fall to her sides. She took several deep breaths, steeled her nerves, and folded both hands behind her back.<br><br><br><br>Lucina couldn't help but be enamored with Olivia's perfectly round breasts, soft pink nipples, and dainty, hairless, adorable womanhood. She kept her staring to a minimum, for fear that Olivia could faint, and looked up to her eyes as soon as she could.<br><br>‶Olivia, you look fantastic naked,‶ Lucina declared with a smile.<br><br>‶Th-Thank you, Lucina,‶ Olivia managed to say after a moment's hesitation. ‶You look fantastic as well,‶ she reciprocated, her eyes scanning Lucina's slender and fit form once again.<br><br>Lucina giggled with a smile and a blush on her face.<br><br><br><br>The two naked girls stood awkwardly for a moment, each trying to find something to say.<br><br>‶Umm, what now?‶ Lucina asked with a chuckle after many long seconds had passed.<br><br>‶Heh…‶ Olivia laughed under her breath, looking at the floor as she covered her breasts and crotch once more. ‶Are you, umm…‶ the pink-haired woman began, looking off to the side. ‶Is this, uh… doing things for you?‶ she asked, terribly embarrassed to ask yet too curious to stay silent.<br><br>Lucina's cheeks went hot at the thought of it. This was to help Olivia, but was there an ulterior motive as well? When Lucina looked down at her chest and saw that her nipples were fully erect, there was no denying it.<br><br>‶Oh… M-Maybe… I'm sorry,‶ Lucina said, suddenly feeling guilty.<br><br>‶Don't be sorry! I didn't mean to make you feel guilty. I was just curious… Actually, I'm sorry for asking such a personal question…‶ Olivia said regretfully.<br><br>‶It's okay! It isn't exactly a secret, is it?‶ Lucina remarked, gesturing toward her hard nipples with her finger.<br><br>Olivia giggled, astounded with herself that she was so comfortable in such a lewd situation. ‶I suppose this is mutually beneficial then. You're helping me become desensitized, and I'm helping you to, uhh… feel good,‶ Olivia said with a shy smile.<br><br>She couldn't believe the words that were leaving her mouth! Surely adrenaline was the main thing keeping her going during this incredibly bizarre scenario, she thought. Perhaps she could use it to her advantage, and do something extra bold…<br><br><br><br>Olivia cleared her throat and placed her hands behind her back, leaving her naked form exposed completely to her friend. ‶Lucina… I think I'd like to try to dance for you, like this,‶ she declared.<br><br>Lucina was shocked to hear Olivia suggest doing something so brazen.<br><br>‶I'm very comfortable with you, and this would be a real test that may help me to grow,‶ the dancer explained.<br><br>Lucina blushed profusely at the idea of her sexy sister-in-arms dancing naked for her in the privacy of her tent. ‶Are you sure? That's… incredibly brave of you. Maybe this idea really is working,‶ Lucina said with a smile.<br><br>‶I feel like maybe it is,‶ Olivia agreed, sheepishly grinning. ‶I can't explain it, but I'm just feeling so confident tonight, like this, with you… Normally I'd be mortified beyond imagination, but I'm unfazed. It's like a dream,‶ Olivia explained.<br><br>Lucina smiled warmly, glad that her friend was feeling so good about herself, and proud that she was venturing so far outside her comfort zone.<br><br>‶I suppose you should have a seat on the bed, and I'll get started,‶ Olivia suggested.<br><br>Lucina gave a nod, sat down, and eagerly waited for Olivia to give her performance.<br><br><br><br>Olivia took slow, deep breaths as she did a few stretches.<br><br>Lucina couldn't help but stare at the curvy woman's bare breasts as they rose and fell with her breathing. She was thankful that Olivia's eyes were closed, and put her lecherous gaze to an end out of respect.<br><br>‶Okay. Deep breaths… Don't think, just move. Go along with the routine like normal,‶ Olivia told herself as she prepared to begin.<br><br>With one last steadying exhale, she took on the starting pose, and began her routine. She opened her eyes and smiled pleasantly as she began seductively waving her arms and swaying her hips.<br><br>Lucina couldn't believe what she was seeing! Even with her clothes on, Olivia had never looked so content and self-assured while performing a dance. Her face was devoid of even the smallest hint of bashfulness or inhibition as she carried out her performance.<br><br>‶Wow… I think this really is doing amazing things for her! She's so happy!‶ Lucina thought, feeling fuzzy inside. ‶She's also sexy… Very sexy…‶ she couldn't help but admit, having taken notice of the jiggling motions in Olivia's plump buttocks and breasts as she moved.<br><br>What Olivia did next was her most audacious and risqué move of all. She lifted her right leg high and executed a full pirouette, which gave Lucina an unobstructed glance at her most private area.<br><br><br><br>‶That's right, Olivia… No shame, no reservations… There's no need to be ashamed, especially in front of Lucina. You can do this… No, you ARE doing it! Dancing for someone, completely nude! This is the beginning of a new you! A new Olivia who's braver than ever before! An Olivia who isn't too shy to do anything!‶ Olivia thought as she finished her routine, a graceful smile adorning her pretty face as she posed elegantly with her arms outward, her feet together, her head lowered, and her eyes closed.<br><br>Lucina began clapping quietly, astounded by Olivia's performance. ‶That was wonderful, Olivia! You danced more beautifully than ever! And you did it in your purest form!‶ Lucina praised.<br><br>At this very moment, Olivia came plummeting down from her adrenaline high, and crouched low to the floor with her arms wrapped around herself. ‶Th-Thank you…‶ she murmured, feeling terribly embarrassed yet still accomplished and proud.<br><br><br><br>Lucina stood up from the bed, chuckling softly at the sight of Olivia curling up. ‶Don't be shy,‶ she said, extending a hand.<br><br>Olivia looked at the slender hand before her, and contemplated for a moment before reaching out and taking it. She rose to her feet, opting not to cover herself.<br><br>The two stared into each other's eyes for several seconds, the bond between them unspoken but strong.<br><br>‶I'm very proud of you,‶ Lucina said earnestly with a meaningful grin on her lips.<br><br>Olivia gave no verbal reply, but instead leaned into Lucina for a tight embrace. Lucina was startled by the abrupt hug, but quickly reciprocated and held her friend tightly. The sensation of Olivia's perky breasts pressing against Lucina's flat chest was one that neither girl would soon be forgetting.<br><br><br><br>When their hug came to an end, Olivia looked in endearment into Lucina's blue eyes.<br><br>‶Thank you, Lucina… I think maybe this could mean big changes for me. You've helped me do things I never could have imagined. You're a true friend,‶ the pink-haired girl thanked, her eyes teary.<br><br>‶Of course, Olivia. You're a wonderful person with a heart as beautiful as her body,‶ Lucina praised, moved by Olivia's heartfelt thanks and her newfound confidence.<br><br>Olivia then came in for another tight hug, to which Lucina offered no objections.<br><br>‶I think maybe I'll get dressed now,‶ Olivia declared with a grin as she stepped back.<br><br>‶I think maybe I'll stay naked,‶ Lucina joked. She turned around to give Olivia her privacy as she dressed herself, simply staring and contemplating the evening all the while.<br><br>Olivia, to her own surprise, found herself glancing in Lucina's direction once or twice, unable to resist taking a peek…<br><br><br><br>‶Well, I suppose I should be heading to my tent and getting ready to sleep,‶ Olivia said, now fully dressed.<br><br>‶Alright!‶ Lucina replied with a smile, seated on her bed, still naked.<br><br>‶Thank you again for tonight. I feel like I've taken an important first step toward conquering my shyness,‶ Olivia spoke from the heart.<br><br>‶Of course! Any time!‶ Lucina said kindly.<br><br>‶Is that an invitation? Just, um… Since it worked so well, maybe we… could do something like this again,‶ Olivia awkwardly suggested.<br><br>‶I'd be very happy to!‶ Lucina answered, still smiling brightly.<br><br>‶And, umm… If you decide to do something again like you did earlier… Promise you'll be careful,‶ Olivia requested with an understanding grin.<br><br>‶I will,‶ Lucina assured with a small laugh.<br><br>‶And one last thing…‶ Olivia began as she headed for the exit. ‶You have a very nice bottom, Lucina,‶ she complimented as she left the tent.<br><br><br><br>This sent a surge of energy through Lucina, who promptly had a titillating idea which she immediately put into action. She leapt up from the bed, darted to the front of the tent, got Olivia's attention with a ‶Psst!‶ and separated the tent flaps using her bare backside, which stuck outside the tent.<br><br>Olivia gasped as her eyes met Lucina's butt, which was softly lit by the moon above, exposed to the outside world. Olivia panicked, and out of pure instinct to protect her friend's modesty, she let her reflexes take over. With both hands, she reached forward and pushed Lucina's rear end into the tent so that it would be hidden from view.<br><br>Instantly her face turned a deep red, and she froze on the spot. Lucina then poked her head out, doing the best she could to stifle her laughter. ‶Naughty!‶ Lucina whispered, wearing nothing but a beaming smile.<br><br>‶I-I-I was just trying to… It was a reflex!‶ Olivia tried to explain, terribly ashamed of touching her friend without consent.<br><br>‶It's okay, it's okay,‶ Lucina reassured, conscious of Olivia's fears. ‶Go home and get some sleep,‶ she urged kindly.<br><br>Olivia nodded, embarrassed by what she'd done, but relieved that Lucina wasn't bothered.<br><br>‶See you soon!‶ Lucina said before parting the tent's flaps for a brief moment to give Olivia and the camp a full-frontal flash. Lucina caught only a glimpse of her friend's stunned face before tying the flaps shut and hopping into bed.<br><br>‶What a night…‶ she whispered with a lewd smirk. Instantly she put her right hand into action, and spent the next hour reliving the evening again and again." },
      { title: "Chapter 6", summary: "Caught in the Act", content: "Several days had passed since Lucina's first streak through the Shepherds' camp and her consequent meeting with Olivia. The swordswoman and the dancer had given each other a knowing smile each time their paths had crossed, their bond notably strengthened by the events of that exciting evening.<br><br>As the sun disappeared beneath the trees, Lucina entered her private tent with her arms stretched above her head. She had spent much of her day practicing her dexterity with her blade, but her performance had been hindered by a lack of focus. Despite her best efforts to keep a clear and pure mind while training, her brain inevitably wandered to her exciting memories of her nude excursion.<br><br><br><br>The thoughts continued to bounce around in her head as she disrobed. Lucina recalled the things she'd heard from her fellow Shepherds the morning following her daring naked run.<br><br>‶Running through camp naked?‶<br><br>‶It couldn't have been one of ours, right?‶<br><br>‶And you couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman?‶<br><br>‶It had to be a guy! That chest was as flat as a board!‶<br><br>‶I keep telling you, it was a woman… I saw for sure…‶<br><br>Lucina blushed just thinking about it. It was almost like she'd become a local legend.<br><br><br><br>With her tent tied shut and all her clothes discarded, Lucina hopped onto her bed and gave herself a single, spirited rub in her most private place. ‶Aaahhhmmmm~‶ she moaned, biting her lips as if to seal the noise in her mouth. It was clear she was overdue for some stimulation. She hesitated, though, wondering if perhaps she could improve her self-pleasure session with a devilishly exciting appetizer first…<br><br>‶Is it too soon? Could I get away with it again?‶ Lucina wondered with a naughty grin. ‶Maybe just a little run around the tents… Not in front of anyone this time. Nobody will see, nobody will know…‶ It didn't take much consideration before Lucina decided to retrieve her mask and hood.<br><br><br><br>Wearing nothing but her head and face coverings, Lucina peeked outside her tent, and determined that the coast was clear. With one last little teasing rub to her womanhood, she exited her tent into the cool night.<br><br>Lucina smiled as the air traveled all around her nude body. Being naked in the camp felt just as wonderful as it had the first time! The moonlight on her skin, the soil against her bare feet, the wind caressing her curves… The sensation was like a beautiful dream.<br><br><br><br>Suddenly, Lucina came to a halt. It felt as though she'd hit a brick wall, and she was unable to move any part of her body. She began to panic, wondering what in the world was happening, and why at the worst of times.<br><br>‶Well, well…‶ A smooth and sensual feminine voice came from behind. ‶Seems I've caught our streaker…‶<br><br>Lucina's heart stopped. She struggled to move, to no avail. She felt the earth brushing against her feet as she was dragged backwards by magic. It was clear she was under the spell of a mage, most likely a powerful one.<br><br>‶Oh, please don't be…‶ Lucina thought as she was dragged inside a tent. Unfortunately, it was just as she'd feared. Her captor was Tharja.<br><br><br><br>‶Let's just see who you are,‶ Tharja said with a smirk as she reached for Lucina's hood and removed it.<br><br>There was nothing Lucina could do to resist. Her stomach sank as her mask, the only thing keeping her identity a secret, was stripped away from her.<br><br>Tharja's dark eyes went wide. ‶Lucina! My, I never would've expected this from you…‶ She released her magical grip, and Lucina stumbled to the floor, with nothing to hide any part of her.<br><br>Lucina knelt on all fours, propping herself up on her hands as she stared downward in shame.<br><br>‶What was this, for fun?‶ Tharja questioned. ‶Maybe a dare? Or is it how you get off?‶ she asked, her lips curling into a wicked smile.<br><br>Lucina froze completely. Tharja had seen right through her.<br><br>‶Please…‶ Lucina begged, still too mortified to raise her head.<br><br>‶‘Don't tell anyone?' Don't worry. It'll be a secret between you and me… So long as you let me in on every detail. The whole truth,‶ Tharja stipulated.<br><br><br><br>Lucina had no choice. Although she was not keen to trust Tharja, she knew that defying her would certainly result in her secret being made known to all. The only thing she could do was give Tharja what she wanted.<br><br>‶You were right,‶ Lucina began, her throat weak. ‶It's how I… get off.‶<br><br>Tharja chuckled. ‶Lucina, the exhibitionist… You enjoy showing off your body, but you don't want anyone to know your identity. Correct?‶<br><br>Lucina nodded silently.<br><br>‶Tell me more,‶ Tharja implored. ‶I want to know what's going on inside your pretty little head when you're gallivanting around in the nude, and they're all looking at you…‶<br><br>Tharja's phrasing only added to the redness of Lucina's face.<br><br>The blue-haired woman gulped. She still faced downward and crouched on the floor as she addressed the dark mage before her. ‶I… I like it when people look at me…‶ she admitted. Deep down, there was a part of her that enjoyed saying it out loud, even in this situation.<br><br>‶We're past that already. I want details. What do you enjoy about it? Are you proud of your body?‶ Tharja questioned Lucina, her smile unwavering.<br><br><br><br>Lucina cleared her throat. She could feel her heart thumping forcefully and relentlessly. It was futile to resist Tharja's prying. The whole truth would have to come out.<br><br>‶Well… I'm actually… insecure about some things, and…‶ she began.<br><br>‶Things like what?‶ Tharja asked.<br><br>‶My… My chest…‶<br><br>Tharja let out a chuckle.<br><br>‶And… my bottom…‶<br><br>‶What about your chest and bottom?‶<br><br>Lucina took a breath, trying to calm herself. ‶My chest is flat, and my rear end is quite big, relatively…‶<br><br>‶Mmm… That's true. I always noticed you had a young boy's chest, but a bountiful, prominent backside,‶ Tharja remarked.<br><br><br><br>Tharja's words shot through Lucina like electricity. The feeling of having her insecurities corroborated by another person was as disheartening as it was deliciously exhilarating.<br><br>‶So you're embarrassed by these traits of yours, but you like when people look at your body?‶ Tharja asked.<br><br>Lucina was quiet.<br><br>‶Hmm… Could it be that you enjoy that feeling of embarrassment?~‶ the dark-haired mage posited.<br><br><br><br>Lucina's entire body trembled with both shameful excitement and excited shame. Tharja had laid her secret bare, out loud, right before her.<br><br>Tharja wore a smile that could almost be described as evil. Lucina's reaction had told all. Her silence, her shaking, her heavy breathing…<br><br>‶Incredible…‶ Tharja remarked, crossing her arms. ‶Such a serious, solemn young woman. I never would have imagined it, and yet, somehow it makes perfect sense.‶<br><br>Lucina continued to stare at the floor of the tent, her head lowered.<br><br>‶Look up at me, Lucina. Let's see that pretty face,‶ Tharja commanded.<br><br>As mortified as she was, Lucina was in no position to defy the mage's request. She raised her head, and made eye contact with Tharja.<br><br>Tharja couldn't help but let out a delighted chuckle. The naked warrior princess's adorable beet-red face was absolutely delicious to behold.<br><br>‶That look on your face… You're effectively being humiliated right now, but you like it, don't you?‶ Tharja teased.<br><br>Lucina offered no reply, which communicated wordlessly that Tharja's guess was spot-on.<br><br>‶Alright. Stand up, then, and I'll take a good look at the rest of you,‶ the mage directed.<br><br><br><br>Lucina's heart nearly leapt from her chest. Tharja intended to examine her naked body, like a specimen to be studied. The very idea was so degrading, but so undeniably enticing. Her legs quaked as she stood straight up, letting her arms hang at her sides.<br><br>‶Mmm!‶ Tharja hummed quizzically as her eyes scanned up and down the bare swordswoman. She grinned as she soaked in the image of the Shepherds' most skilled warrior in the buff.<br><br>Tharja walked slowly in a circle around Lucina, intent on seeing every part of her body. ‶Heh… That really is quite a rear end. You're such a slender girl, but it's so big and round…‶ she commented.<br><br>‶She's staring… Looking right at my big, bare bottom…‶ Lucina had to fight back a lewd smile.<br><br>‶Your chest, though…‶ Tharja began, having made her way around to Lucina's front again. ‶It really is as flat as it always looked.‶<br><br>Tharja's words were like daggers, and yet they brought Lucina satisfaction more than anything else.<br><br><br><br>‶Oh?‶ Upon closer examination, Tharja found that Lucina's pretty pink nipples were erect. Looking downward, it seemed her most private area was also rather awake. ‶You really are enjoying this…‶ Tharja said with a taunting smile as she stared directly into Lucina's eyes.<br><br>Lucina mirrored Tharja's gaze, trying her best to keep a neutral face.<br><br>Tharja snapped her finger and pointed at Lucina's womanhood. A blast of frigid air emerged from the mage's fingertip, striking its target perfectly.<br><br>‶AAAHH!‶ Lucina let out an undignified shriek as she leapt backwards, sheltering her vagina with both hands.<br><br>Tharja laughed out loud at Lucina's reaction. ‶Forgive me, I just had to… You are adorable,‶ she said with a grin once she'd composed herself. ‶Hmm…‶ she murmured.<br><br>Lucina watched Tharja's facial expression change. It seemed she was contemplating something… Surely this could not be good.<br><br><br><br>‶Lucina, I have a proposition for you,‶ Tharja said after a moment.<br><br>‶Which is…?‶ Lucina asked anxiously.<br><br>Tharja took a seat on the edge of her bed. ‶You enjoy people looking at you naked, largely due to the embarrassment. I enjoy watching your enjoyment. I think perhaps we could go forward with a mutually beneficial arrangement,‶ she explained.<br><br>Lucina waited for the mage to continue, still covering her chilly crotch with her hands.<br><br>‶I hide in the shadows and humiliate you by exposing your naked body to the entire camp using my spells. I then cast a forgetting spell, so no one remembers a thing, except for you and me. You get to experience ultimate nude embarrassment with no consequences, and I get to watch,‶ Tharja concluded with a smirk.<br><br>Lucina's lips parted slightly as she considered the proposal. ‶How do I know you'll really go through with this alleged forgetting spell? And, that it actually works?‶ she asked.<br><br>Tharja raised an eyebrow. ‶You want proof? Turn around,‶ she requested.<br><br>The blue-haired woman complied, and turned to face away from Tharja.<br><br><br><br>Tharja swiftly and suddenly delivered a hard slap to Lucina's rear end, producing a loud smack.<br><br>‶Owww!‶ Lucina groaned. ‶How does this-‶<br><br>Tharja waved her hand in a specific way, and instantly Lucina had lost her memory of the previous few seconds.<br><br>‶Wait… What happened?‶ Lucina asked, wondering why she was facing the wall, and why her bottom stung.<br><br>‶Exactly. Forgetting spells are rather simple, actually,‶ Tharja said.<br><br>‶… I see…‶ Lucina turned to face Tharja again. She was tempted to ask about the sensation on her butt, but opted to leave it be.<br><br>‶I should easily be able to make the entire camp forget about your little performance,‶ the mage assured.<br><br>‶I don't know…‶ Lucina said, her apprehension clear.<br><br>Tharja supposed Lucina would require some more convincing. ‶Imagine it… All your allies and friends, the people you most admire, and who most admire you, staring at you in your most pure form. Utterly, completely naked… Your flat chest, your voluptuous rear, your blue hair down there… They'd see it all. All of you, Lucina, the most respected swordswoman of a generation... Your-‶<br><br><br><br>‶I'll do it,‶ Lucina interrupted.<br><br>Tharja's purplish lips curled into a wolfish grin once more. ‶I knew you'd crack…‶<br><br>Lucina chuckled shyly. ‶So, umm… When are you planning on making this happen?‶ she asked.<br><br>‶If I told you, that'd ruin the fun, wouldn't it?~‶ Tharja teased.<br><br>Lucina looked surprised. Tharja was turning this into a surprise attack?<br><br>‶Alright. I suppose I'll just wait then…‶ she agreed.<br><br>‶Good girl. You'd better get back to your tent and get some rest, in case I decide tomorrow is the day. You wouldn't want to be sleepy for your big moment, would you?‶ Tharja advised.<br><br>‶Right… Well, umm… I'll see you later. And… thank you…‶ Lucina said sheepishly, covering her chest and crotch.<br><br>‶Don't thank me yet. The real fun starts later,‶ Tharja said with a wink. ‶Run along now!‶<br><br><br><br>Lucina peered out of Tharja's tent, confirmed that no one was around, and made a naked dash back to her own tent. Once inside, she tied the flaps shut, leapt onto her bed face-first, and began to contemplate everything that had just transpired.<br><br>‶I cannot believe I got caught… So soon after leaving my tent too…‶<br><br>Lucina recalled each feeling of every moment. That crippling rush of being caught, the humiliation of being made to exhibit herself for Tharja. She rolled onto her back, and placed her hand upon her privates.<br><br>What a mess I've gotten myself into… Such an extremely perverted, ludicrously exciting mess…‶<br><br>She began to fantasize about the arrangement she and Tharja had made. Naked in front of everyone, but no one would remember a thing? It was almost too good to be true!<br><br>Lucina hoped she could trust Tharja to execute the forgetting spell properly, if at all. Momentary embarrassment was one thing, but all of her friends seeing her naked and remembering it forever would simply be too much.<br><br>In the moment, however, the concept brought Lucina a wonderful orgasm." }
