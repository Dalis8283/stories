      { title: "Chapter 1", summary: " Living in a Nudist House", content: "Erin yawned. It had been another boring day at work. The monotony of her days was starting to get to her. She was only 25 years old but if this was gonna be what the rest of her life looked like, she was not looking forward to it. Every day, she woke up early with a cup of coffee, went to work, sat in her cubicle and stared at her computer screen until her boss called her. Then in the evening, she was usually too tired to do anything for herself. Tonight was just such a night. She had just gotten home, fed her cat, turned on the TV, and plopped on her couch while sorting through her mail.<br><br>She didn’t actually watch television, but it gave her some background noise. Her mail didn’t really seem all that exciting. A tax invoice, yet another advertisement for the same magazine about cars that she really didn’t want, a letter from her landlord. All very mundane - that is, until she got to the last of her mail. It was yet another advertisement and she would have just thrown it away but the pricing caught her attention.<br><br>A three course meal to unwind for just ten dollars? Erin pondered. That seemed way too cheap to be true. Looking over its contents she only saw a few pictures of the restaurant itself, some of the dishes they served and a small map that showed its location. She tilted her head as she reached for her phone. She took a picture of the ad and sent the image to her best friend, Amanda, as well as a message.<br><br><br><br>Know anything about this?<br><br><br><br>Amanda had a bit more free time on her hands and was usually up to date with any new establishments in town. It didn’t take long before she replied.<br><br><br><br>Very little. Has good food but no idea why it’s so cheap. Wanna check it out?<br><br><br><br>Good food. A three-course meal. All for just ten dollars? It seemed too good to be true; there had to be a catch but if there was it wasn’t mentioned anywhere. Amanda didn’t seem to know much about the place so the only way to find out was, indeed, to go and check it out. Erin hesitated. It all sounded rather fishy, but what harm could there be in simply checking it out and seeing for herself? Eventually, she texted back.<br><br><br><br>Alright, meet you there.<br><br><br><br>She was just going to put a pizza in the oven but she had to admit that a buffet seemed much more inviting. She quickly changed from her work outfit into casual clothing: jeans, white socks and a pink sweater over a white tank top. She put on a pair of sneakers and her coat, and grabbed her bag before making her way out the door.<br><br><br><br><br><br>‶Erin, over here!‶ Amanda shouted from the corner of the street. She had met her friend in kindergarten and they had been close friends ever since. Their friendship had endured some strains, such as when they had both fallen in love with the same guy in high school, but that was solved when the guy turned out to be a huge prick. Unlike Erin’s flowing, brown hair that reached to her shoulders, Amanda was a blonde, her straight hair reaching down to her mid-back. While Erin had an olive skin tone, Amanda’s skin was usually a lot lighter, except for during the summer. Both friends had light blue eyes though. She was wearing a light blue dress under a black vest. She wore a pair of black stockings and black boots. Erin joined her and gave her friend a hug.<br><br>   ‶Hiya,‶ she said with a smile.<br><br>   ‶The restaurant is just around the corner. If it turns out to be nothing, we can always just go elsewhere,‶ Amanda said..<br><br>   ‶Alright, sounds good!‶ Erin replied.<br><br>From the outside, the restaurant looked innocuous. There was a terrace outside, but since winter was approaching, nobody was using those seats. The name of the restaurant featured prominently on the window. ‘Chez Louise’. Inside, Erin could see a few people eating with apparent enjoyment.<br><br>   ‶Let’s go in, I guess,‶ Amanda proposed but Erin halted.<br><br>   ‶We’re really going in?‶ she asked.<br><br>   ‶Well, yeah,‶ Amanda laughed. ‶Come on! Don’t chicken out on me now. Let’s at least see what kind of food they offer.‶<br><br>   ‶Oh alright, I’ll come,‶ Erin said, laughing nervously. As the two women stepped from the cold outside into the warm hall, Erin noticed a feeling of anticipation washing over her, but she couldn’t quite explain why. Perhaps it was the strong scent of perfume that hung in the air here.<br><br>The entry hall was decorated in a rather old-fashioned style as if this were the 1920s. Pictures of typical French sights, such as the Eiffel tower, hung on the wall. A large chandelier hung from the ceiling. Inside it was quite extravagant, considering that this was just the hallway. The pair noticed a woman, probably in her forties, sitting at a counter near the door on the far side. She wore glasses and was writing in a book when she looked up to see who had entered. She wore a formal, cream-coloured suit that fitted her body quite snugly. A smile crept on her face as she beckoned the two women to come forward.<br><br>   ‶Come, dears,‶ she said with a French accent. She looked at Amanda who rolled her eyes in amusement as though she were saying ‘well, here goes nothing.’<br><br>   ‶G-good evening,‶ Erin said, stumbling over her words.<br><br>   ‶We, uh, came here because we read about the buffet,‶ Amanda added.<br><br>The woman’s smile only seemed to grow wider at that. ‶Ah, yes, excellent,‶ she said. ‶I am Louise. Welcome to my establishment. What are your names?‶<br><br>Erin and Amanda looked at each other.<br><br>‶W-wait… is it really just ten dollars for a three-course meal?‶ Erin asked nervously.<br><br>   ‶Oui, Oui, it is just ten dollars. I would not have advertised it as such if it was a lie,‶ Louise said with a chuckle.<br><br>   ‶But there HAS to be some kind of catch, right?‶ Amanda remarked, narrowing her eyes. ‶It just seems so… cheap.‶<br><br>Louise halted at that and eyed the two women curiously. ‶Did you not visit my website? I swear I put a link in the ad…‶ Louise said, half to herself.<br><br>Erin and Amanda looked at each other again. Erin then produced the advertisement and, sure enough, there was a website link at the bottom.<br><br>‶I must have missed that…‶ she said, feeling quite embarrassed now.<br><br>Amanda just giggled and gave her friend a bop to the head.<br><br>‶Nevertheless,‶ she continued, ‶we’d like to know more about that buffet, and sorry we didn’t check out the website.‶<br><br>   ‶Very well,‶ Louisa chuckled. ‶In my restaurant, I offer my guests the opportunity to unwind and let off some steam. One does that best when one is from one’s confines.‶<br><br>The two young women looked at each other, confused, for a third time.<br><br>‶Our… confines?‶ Erin asked.<br><br>   ‶Why, your clothes, of course,‶ Louise said matter of factly.<br><br>The resulting gasp from Erin and Amanda were so loud they could have been heard on the street.<br><br>‶What in the…‶ Amanda started but Louise just laughed it off.<br><br>   ‶I suspect most people have this initial reaction,‶ she said. ‶I assure you, though, that none have left unsatisfied.‶<br><br>   ‶And... how many have actually gone for this offer?‶ Erin demanded.<br><br>   ‶More than you might think, dear,‶ Louise replied. She then retrieved a leaflet from behind the counter and handed it to the two guests. ‶I suspect you’re ready to leave, but please accept this.‶<br><br>Reluctantly, Erin took it and briefly scanned its contents.<br><br>‶Right. We are out of here,‶ Amanda said, sounding quite offended. She then grabbed Erin by the wrist and dragged her back outside. All the while, Erin could see that Louise was just smiling deviously. There was just something unsettling about it…<br><br><br><br>‶Can you believe this?‶ Amanda asked, still fuming about their earlier encounter. The two women had decided to go to the nearest pizza place instead and have their dinner there. Only now did they get the chance to take a look at the leaflet Louise had given them. Unlike the general leaflet, this one was much more explicit and had several pictures of people, both men and women, dining in various stages of undress. The way it seemed to work was that customers going for this buffet had to hand in one article of clothing with every item they ordered. There were reviews from people describing it as a wonderful experience and how amazing it felt to let themselves go for a night but Amanda suspected that they were written by Louise herself.<br><br>   ‶It does sound very far-fetched,‶ Erin remarked.<br><br>   ‶It’s not just far-fetched,‶ Amanda started, taking a vicious bite out of her pizza slice, yet continuing to talk. ‶This is downright exploitative and probably illegal!‶<br><br>   ‶Well, if it were illegal then surely someone would have called the cops on her already,‶ Erin reasoned.<br><br>   Amanda just angrily chewed on her food for a few moments, trying to come up with a comeback. Only when she had swallowed did she speak up again, holding the remains of her pizza slice in her hands while she made more angry gestures.<br><br>‶I just can’t believe that people would actually go for this! How is this supposed to help people relax? If I wanna relax, I just go to a spa!‶ Her tirade went on for quite some time and she kept raising her voice every so often to the point where Erin had to ask her to quieten down.<br><br>   Erin herself wasn’t really angry - far from it. Ever since they had entered Chez Louise, she had felt a sense of anticipation that had only grown stronger as the night had gone on. It had felt like some kind of knot in her stomach. That was probably why she had only eaten two slices of her pizza so far. Why did she have this feeling? The roaring twenties style of the restaurant, Louise’s noticeably thick perfume, her devious smile at the end, the explicit leaflet - it had all left impressions on her. Whenever Amanda halted her rant to eat some more, Erin found herself wondering what the appeal to the offer was. Being naked in the middle of a busy restaurant where everybody else was clothed? Unable to fully cover herself? Only allowed to get dressed again after she had finished ordering? All of the eyes from all other people present scanning every inch of her body?<br><br>   ‶... Earth to Erin?‶ came Amanda’s voice.<br><br>   ‶Huh? What?‶ Erin replied, shaking herself out of her thoughts. Had she been daydreaming?<br><br>   ‶You kinda zoned out a little…‶<br><br>   ‶Ah, sorry about that.‶<br><br>   ‶No, I get it. I’m just repeating myself and you got bored of it,‶ Amanda chuckled. ‶Point is, this restaurant is stupid.‶<br><br>Both women laughed at this.<br><br>But it wasn’t the same laugh.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The rest of the week was rather uneventful. Erin had gone to work as normal and she and Amanda didn’t talk about Chez Louise again. However, that didn’t mean that it wasn’t on her mind. On the contrary. Stripping naked in front of a bunch of strangers was so out there that she couldn’t help but be intrigued by the idea. She even caught herself fantasising about it. This really concerned her a great deal. Amanda had said that nobody in their right mind could enjoy such a thing. And yet… here she was, imagining herself being naked in front of clothed strangers. What did that say about her? Was she mad? If Louise was correct and there were a fair amount of people who indulged in this, did that make them mad too? Or were they really all faked, as Amanda had suggested?<br><br>   That Thursday evening, after work, Erin was relaxing on the couch with her cat, Coco, on her lap, zapping between the channels. There wasn’t much of interest on right now though, just some boring reality shows, a few soaps that didn’t interest her and the news. Eventually, she just settled for a random movie, which looked to be a comedy. The jokes were mostly very lame, but it got the occasional chuckle out of her. That is until one scene where the main character’s dress got stuck in a car door, which then drove off, leaving her standing in her underwear in the middle of the street. The eyes of those around her were all over her exposed body... including those of Erin.<br><br>   Okay, that’s it! she thought to herself. She couldn’t resist this any longer. She wanted to know more. And what better way to know more than to go and experience it for herself?<br><br><br><br><br><br>The following evening, Erin was standing in front of Chez Louise again. Through the window, she could see a fair amount of guests already dining. All of them were fully clothed as normal. Would she really be able to strip in front of all of these people? Would they laugh? Would they call her a slut? Or would it be normal?<br><br>   Amanda had told her that she had a date with her boyfriend that evening so Erin didn’t have to worry too much about her friend. After all, how could she possibly explain this to Amanda? No, this was her night. Hers and hers alone.<br><br>For the night, she had decided to wear some extra clothing. A pair of ankle boots, socks, tights, skirt, top, shirt, vest and underwear. She had a coat as well of course, but she assumed that she would be taking that off regardless. That left nine pieces of clothing. Eleven if the socks and shoes were counted separately. It would take about nine or eleven orders to be stripped fully. At a normal restaurant, she would usually only order two drinks at the most, the main dish and maybe a dessert. Four out of eleven didn’t seem too bad but four out of nine? That would be quite risque already! Would she strip fully though? She could just order a drink and one dish. She would only have to take off two articles of clothing and though that already sounded like it would be quite embarrassing, at least she wouldn’t have to show too much skin. But then again, the prospect of showing off everything… no! She would just try it out. It was only ten bucks after all.<br><br>Erin hesitated. She could still turn back. There was no obligation to do this. But she had come here because she chose to do so. She wanted to experience this. Finally, she convinced herself to open the door and go in.<br><br>   When she entered the main hall, the by now familiar scent of Louise’s perfume hit her hard. Up ahead, Louise was talking with a man and a woman, whom Erin presumed to be other guests. Would they strip? Or would only one of them strip? And if so, which of them would do that? Were they just here to watch a good show, given to them by Erin herself? Or were they just here to eat? The amount of questions that were buzzing around in her head constantly were making her very anxious.<br><br>   It didn’t take long before the guests entered the main restaurant and Louise instantly noticed her, that same devious smile plastered all over her face.<br><br>   ‶Welcome, mademoiselle,‶ she said, eyeing Erin from top to toe through those spectacles of hers. ‶I knew you would be back.‶<br><br>   This remark really didn’t make things any better for Erin but she was a woman on a mission. ‶H-hi,‶ she stammered.<br><br>   ‶I see you are alone this time,‶ Louise said. ‶Were you not able to convince her to come?‶<br><br>   ‶She… she doesn’t even know,‶ Erin blurted out. She felt her face heating up, becoming beetroot red.. She didn’t like keeping secrets from her best friend, but the way she had ranted about this place made telling her seem out of the question.<br><br>   ‶Ah, I see, I see,‶ Louise chuckled. ‶I did not expect her to come anyway. Not like you, and here you are now! At least, I assume you have come here for the buffet?‶<br><br>   This was Erin’s last chance. She could tell Louise that she just wanted to eat normally. That she was just here to try out the food that she had heard such good things about. ‶I-I am, yes,‶ she found herself saying as she reached for the ten dollar bill that she had ready in her pocket. This was definitely not her rational side speaking, but she had said it out loud now anyway. This was it.<br><br>   ‶Excellent!‶ Louise said as she wrote something down in the book on her desk. ‶What is your name, mademoiselle?‶<br><br>   ‶Erin. Erin Gonzales.‶ The brunette tried to peek at what Louise was writing down. Though the text was upside down for her, she could make out several other names, both male and female. Were they the ones that have gone before her? She even noticed a few names appearing multiple times. She didn’t really get to look for long though as Louise stood up again.<br><br>   ‶And noted,‶ she said as she opened the door. ‶Follow me, please.‶<br><br>On the other side, the scent of perfume made way for a whole assortment of pleasant scents. It was quite busy here. Almost every table was in use by people eating all sorts of food. It looked and smelled so delicious. The roaring twenties style continued here too. If anything, the restaurant was highly stylised. Something that Erin could really admire. None of the guests appeared to be naked though. Would she be the only one tonight?<br><br>‶This way,‶ Louise said, catching Erin’s attention again. The hostess had moved over to a door off to the left. It had appeared to be a staff entrance to Erin at first, but it actually led to a completely different part of the restaurant. ‶Guests such as yourself will be seated here.‶<br><br>‶So… not among all of those people?‶ Erin asked. A sense of relief came over her when she heard this. This sense was abruptly shattered again when she actually entered this new room. It looked a lot like the general restaurant, only smaller. However, the most notable feature of this room was the fact that the right wall was a gigantic window. It gave a good view of the general restaurant. Or rather, it gave the restaurant a good view of this room.<br><br>Of her soon to be exposed body.<br><br>‶Pick a chair, mon cherie,‶ Louise said. ‶A waitress will be with you shortly. For now, allow me to take your coat.‶ Erin just complied with the request, giving her coat to the hostess who then left through the door again, closing it behind her.<br><br>The room was empty, save for Erin. Looking to the right though, she certainly wasn’t alone. There were so many people sitting just a few feet away from her, and yet… none of them seemed to be looking her way. They were all just focusing on their food, or on talking to their friends and family. Perhaps they did not know what this part of the restaurant would entail? Or perhaps they were simply waiting for her clothes to actually start coming off? When she turned around to look at the left wall, it was actually a large mirror. It seemed rather peculiar, but Erin figured it was probably just so that guests could look at their own nude bodies if they wanted that. Eventually, the brunette settled on a chair somewhere near the mirror side of the room. The chairs and tables seemed like they would at least partially block the restaurant’s view of her body.<br><br>Before long, a young, red-haired woman, dressed in what looked like a French maid outfit, entered the room. She went over to Erin’s table and handed her the menu.<br><br>‶Good evening,‶ she said. This woman looked to be about Erin’s age. Unlike Louise, she did not have any sort of accent, meaning she was probably from this town, as Erin was. She had freckles dotting her face, wore glasses and had a small pair of earrings in the shape of flowers. Her upper teeth almost seemed to go over her lower lips naturally and she had her curly hair quite short. Her name tag appeared to read ‘Lola’.<br><br>The thought occurred to Erin then that she could encounter any of the people that would be seeing her tonight elsewhere, and at any time. How awkward would that be? What if a friend of her saw her like this? It was too late to think about it now.<br><br>‶Good evening,‶ she stammered.<br><br>‶Can I take your order for a drink?‶ Lola asked, holding out a notepad.<br><br>‶I’d… like some white wine, please,‶ Erin asked. If she was gonna do this, she might as well use some alcohol to get through it all.<br><br>‶Of course,‶ the waitress nodded, writing it down. ‶Please, remove one article of clothing as payment.‶<br><br>‶A-ah, yes… of course,‶ Erin replied nervously. She thought about it for a moment. There was no reason to panic yet. It was just one article of clothing. She removed the vest that she was wearing and handed it to Lola, who took it and left the room with it. The fact that her clothing was taken away entirely made this all the more nerve wracking. She would not be able to chicken out and put on her clothes again. Heck, she wouldn’t even know where her clothes would be! Erin noticed that she had goosebumps on her skin. Was this due to the cold or because of the excitement? Whatever the case, she decided to try and calm herself down a little bit by opening up the menu.<br><br>The various dishes were written down in both English and French, with small pictures to show what it would look like. There were three different courses to choose from and goodness it all looked so delicious! There were various dishes using fish, tons of potato-based offerings and much more. Looking it over, there was deliciousness to be found in all three courses that caught her eyes. So much so that she almost forgot about the fact that each of these dishes would require her to take something off, and she was already down one piece just for the drink. Then again… the onion soup did look quite nice. Plus, what harm could one extra piece of clothing do, right? She had so many layers of clothing on right now anyway.<br><br>After a few minutes, Lola re-entered the room with Erin’s glass of wine.<br><br>‶Here you are, ma’am,‶ she said, taking out her notepad again. ‶Have you made a decision?‶<br><br>‶Y-yes. I’ll take the, uh… the onion soup,‶ Erin replied.<br><br>‶Of course,‶ Lola said, writing it down. She seemed to smile a great deal at Erin’s insecurities. As if she were ready to start laughing uncontrollably. Or perhaps she just found it endearing? After all, if Louise was to be believed, she wasn’t the first guest who came here to get naked. ‶Would you like some bread with that?‶<br><br>‶That sounds nice, yes,‶ Erin said, a smile forming on her face now.<br><br>‶Alright,‶ Lola said. ‶Please, remove two articles of clothing then.‶<br><br>‶W-wait… two?‶ Erin gasped.<br><br>‶Well, you ordered onion soup and bread. That’s two,‶ Lola chuckled.<br><br>‶Can… uh… never mind the bread then…‶<br><br>‶I already wrote it down.‶<br><br>   ‶But… oh, alright,‶ Erin huffed. She had been set up by this waitress! It was a trick and she had fallen for it! She felt so stupid, yet there was little she could do about it now. Reaching down, she begrudgingly took off both of her boots and handed them over to the waitress.<br><br>   ‶I’ll accept those as two,‶ Lola said, grinning. She was obviously enjoying this way too much. When she had left the room again, Erin swore she could hear her laughing, or did that just come from the restaurant?<br><br>   Shehad only lost her vest and her shoes, so there was nothing to write home about just yet. She had taken off her vest at restaurants often and though she hadn’t done so with her shoes, it didn’t seem too out of place. Looking to her right, she saw that the guests were still not really looking her way. It eased her mind somewhat, but not by a lot. They were still there. They could still see her if they wanted to.<br><br><br><br>After a few minutes, Erin noticed that she had started rubbing her legs together and she had barely touched her wine. There was this knot in her stomach that had only been growing since leaving her home. Waiting for her food seemed to take a lot longer than usual. Was it just a busy night or was time just going that much slower? And still, she had only taken off her two shoes and her vest. It’s not like she was showing off much skin besides her arms. Just then, the door opened again, suddenly, causing Erin to gasp but she relaxed when she saw that it was the waitress, bringing her her food. When she remembered how that waitress had tricked her though, that relaxation faded again.<br><br>   ‶Here you are, madam,‶ Lola said, placing the soup and bread on Erin’s table.<br><br>‶Th-thank you,‶ Erin replied. The food smelled delicious and she was sure it’d taste delicious too. She just hoped that the knot in her stomach would pass away soon so that she could actually eat. When she looked at Lola again, she was surprised to find that the look she gave Erin just seemed… almost motherly.<br><br>‶Hey, I’m sorry about before,‶ she said, chuckling. ‶We at Chez Louise want people to unwind and let themselves go. I figured you just needed some encouragement.‶<br><br>‶I… I guess,‶ Erin stammered. It was true. On her own, she would never have decided to strip in a busy restaurant. Heck, she was only going to take off a few articles of clothing! Now, she had already lost three of those things. She forced a smile at the waitress.<br><br>‶Thank you.‶<br><br>‶No problem, madam,‶ Lola said, getting out her notepad again. ‶So, have you been able to choose a main dish? Perhaps some side dishes‶<br><br>‶I’ll uh… I’ll take the salmon special,‶ Erin said, pointing it out on the menu. She trembled a little, knowing that she was going to have to take something off again for this, but it honestly did look very good.<br><br>‶Alright,‶ the waitress said, noting it down. ‶And do you want fries, potato wedges or a salad with that?‶<br><br>‶That’s… that’s a side dish, isn’t it?‶<br><br>‶Heh, you’re learning!‶ Lola winked. ‶I do encourage you to consider one though. The kitchen here is really good and as I said, you just seem to need a little bit more encouragement.‶<br><br>‶But… but I don’t want to…‶ Erin stammered.<br><br>‶Then why did you come here for this three course meal in the first place?‶ Lola asked, placing her hands on her hips.<br><br>‶I,‶ Erin started but she stopped. Lola was right. She did come here specifically because this offer intrigued her a lot. She found that the idea might actually appeal to her. She… wanted this.<br><br>‶So, what’ll it be?‶ Lola asked again.<br><br>‶I’ll… I’ll take the wedges,‶ Erin blurted out blushing madly. She was giving in. She knew then that by the end of this night, she’d be fully naked in the middle of this busy restaurant… and she wanted that.<br><br>‶Aaaand noted,‶ the waitress said with a giggle, enjoying this all too much. ‶Two pieces of clothing, please.‶<br><br>‶Right… right…‶ Erin hesitated as she wondered what to take off. The least revealing would be her socks, but they were underneath her tights. Then again, taking off her tights wouldn’t be too bad either. Thus, she stood up, staying closer to the mirror side than the window side. She could almost feel all of the eyes on her, but whenever she looked through the window, they still weren’t looking her way. Perhaps it was just the eyes of Lola that were inspecting her from top to toe. Eventually, she had taken off her tights and one of her socks, handing them over to the waitress.<br><br>‶Thank you kindly,‶ Lola grinned. ‶Enjoy your soup, ma’am.‶ And with that, Lola left, her sock and tights disappearing with her.<br><br>Erin could feel the floor with her bare right foot. It wasn’t cold in the room but she could still feel a chill running down her spine as goosebumps appeared on her leg. It was so unbelievable. She was really doing this. She was really going to go naked here. She was really going to be the only naked individual in a restaurant full of clothed people.<br><br>She tried to calm down. She took a piece of bread, dipped it into her soup and took a small bite. Well, if anything, the rumours were right. She loved it, even though it was just one small bite out of the appetizer. Taking her spoon, she had a bit of soup and sure enough, it was simply divine. This was the kind of food that she could only ever dream of affording with her meagre salary, and here she was, eating it for only ten dollars and the prospect of being naked later tonight. What a crazy situation this all was!" },
      { title: "Chapter 2", summary: "Relaxing on the Couch", content: "By the time her main dish came around, Erin had calmed down somewhat. She constantly eyed the full restaurant while slowly sipping her soup and eating her bread. It wasn’t a whole lot, but that left all the more room for the salmon that was awaiting her on her plate now.<br><br>   ‶Thank you, Lola,‶ she said.<br><br>   ‶How did you enjoy the soup?‶ the waitress asked.<br><br>   ‶It was delicious!‶ Erin replied with a smile.<br><br>   ‶I’ll make sure to pass that on to the kitchen. Were you able to pick a dessert?‶<br><br>   ‶I…‶ Erin started but halted again. Already she was asked to order for a dessert. Well, she still had one sock left, so that wasn’t too bad…<br><br>   ‶I can come back in a few minutes,‶ Lola chuckled.<br><br>   ‶No. I’ll take the Tiramisu… and… and a refill on my wine please,‶ Erin blurted out.<br><br>There was a twinkle in Lola’s eyes at that as her smile grew broader and broader. ‶Now you’re talking,‶ she grinned, writing the orders down in her notepad. ‶Two orders, so…‶<br><br>   ‶Two pieces of clothing, yes, yes… I know,‶ Erin said. She had surprised herself there, asking for a refill on her wine. Sure, her glass was empty now but she wasn’t planning on a refill! And yet, here she was, having to take off her own clothes because she couldn’t resist it. Was it because the wine was so good… or because this growing sensation in her abdomen felt so good? Regardless, she took off her remaining sock… and halted. She only had four pieces of clothing left. Her shirt, her skirt, her bra and her panties. Taking off either her skirt or top would be incredibly revealing, but taking off her bra or panties would make taking off her skirt or top later that much worse. Then again, the order wouldn’t exactly matter too much if she were to be completely nude by the end of all this… finally, she settled on taking off her top and handing it in to the eager waitress. The air that was now freely brushing over her exposed upper body felt exhilarating. She started shaking due to the excitement.<br><br>   And it felt good. It was incredible. She had rarely felt this good before. Exposing herself in front of all of those clothed people in the restaurant. Each of them could see her exposed top in just her bra. Each of them clothed while she was in the process of getting naked. What did this make her? A slut? Did it make her less of a person than them? Or was it simply an incredible feeling for no apparent reason? She didn’t feel like a slut, nor did she feel less than them. In fact, she probably felt more alive than any of them!<br><br>   ‶I will be back shortly then,‶ Lola said, taking the sock and top with her out the room again.<br><br>   This was so unexpected… yet something was still just odd. None of the people were looking her way. No-one saw her. Sure, every now and then, someone would glance her way, but they weren’t actively watching her. Why not? Was it so common to see a woman in just her bra here? Why was she thinking this? Did she WANT to be seen? Just last week, she had been so shy and now…<br><br>   She just started eating her food again and, much like the soup, the fish was simply divine, as were the potato wedges! But… she did miss a sauce. A sauce that would really perfect it. A sauce that… would have her take off her skirt.<br><br>   That’s when her heart sank though. A table right next to her window in the restaurant had freed up earlier and was now being occupied by two new people. One of them she recognized.<br><br>   It was Amanda on her date.<br><br>   Erin wanted to scream but she stopped herself. She wanted to run and hide, but there was nowhere to run to. What was she to do? She did her very best to hide her face with her hair and stare directly down at her table but there was no way she could relax now. What would Amanda think of her? What would she say? She’d certainly think of her best friend differently. Maybe she wouldn’t want to be friends with her anymore?<br><br>   When Lola re-entered the room suddenly, Erin gasped again. The waitress simply placed the glass of wine on the table and tilted her head. ‶What’s up? You were doing so well just now.‶<br><br>   Erin just pointed in the direction of Amanda without looking. ‶I… I k-know that girl.‶<br><br>   ‶Ah,‶ Lola said, nodding. ‶I see. Don’t worry, ma’am. She can’t see you.‶<br><br>   ‶Wait… WHAT?!‶ Erin cried out.<br><br>   ‶This window here appears as a mirror on the other side, you see.‶<br><br>   ‶Why… why did you not tell me this before?!‶<br><br>   ‶The simple and clichéd answer is that you didn’t ask,‶ Lola stated matter-of-factly. ‶Madame Louise told us we can only tell our customers when they specifically ask about it and, well, you may not have asked for it now but I’m doing you a favour here. To calm you down.‶<br><br>   Erin eyed the window. All this time, she was hidden from their eyes without her even knowing. All this time, the only ones who have seen her in her state of undress were Lola and Erin herself. ‶So… I was worried about nothing all this time?‶<br><br>   ‶Well, I wouldn’t say that,‶ Lola chuckled when she looked somewhere behind Erin. She adjusted her clothing slightly and tidied up her hair a little bit. It struck Erin then that she was looking at the mirror behind her.<br><br>   Erin gasped. She had been watched alright, but from the other side. By sitting next to this mirror, she had actually been giving an unknown amount of unseen people a much better view of herself without her realizing it. She wanted to scream again. She wanted to run, but where was she to run to? After all, she couldn’t exactly run out of the room and into the crowded restaurant in nothing but her skirt, bra and panties.<br><br>   But then… her earlier excitement returned to her. She had been giving a very good view to an unknown amount of unseen people. There could be no-one behind that mirror, or there could be a hundred people. There was no way for her to tell and somehow, she knew that Lola wasn’t going to tell her either. People could be watching her right now. People could see her sitting there, in just her skirt, bra and panties. Just thinking about that… she actually found herself getting turned on by the idea. Even the fact that Amanda was currently sitting just a few feet away from her, without being able to actually see her, was somehow very exciting for her. Even though her mind screamed at her that all of this was wrong, she couldn’t help but feel great.<br><br>   ‶So,‶ Lola suddenly said, holding out her pen and her notepad, ‶did you want to order anything more?‶ The smile on her face spoke volumes about what she must have been thinking. Erin figured that Lola probably knew everything that was going through her head right now.<br><br>   Erin stared at the waitress for a good few seconds, contemplating her next move. Finally though, she stood up, resolutely took off her skirt and handed it to Lola. ‶I want some honey mustard sauce,‶ she said firmly before sitting down again.<br><br>   Lola smirked. ‶You’re taking this all quite well all of a sudden,‶ she said, taking the skirt and writing down the new order.<br><br>   A modest smile appeared on Erin’s face. ‶Yes… yes I am,‶ she said.<br><br><br><br>Erin had been sitting in nothing but her underwear for a good while now. Lola had brought her her sauce and she was thoroughly enjoying her meal. Of course, that wasn’t the only thing she was enjoying. She couldn’t help but look through the window to her right, to where Amanda was sitting. Ever since she had gotten here, she had had a look on her face that Erin recognized all too well. She knew that Amanda wasn’t really happy to be sitting in this particular restaurant, but she was still doing this regardless for her boyfriend. Erin also noticed that Amanda was constantly on the lookout, probably to see if she could spot any nude people.<br><br>   At the same time, Erin also looked into the mirror on her left an awful lot. There could be someone staring back at her right at that moment and there was no way for her to know. The unknown, the idea of possibly being exposed to someone, it drove her mad with excitement and pleasure. She was enjoying this so much more than she had initially thought.<br><br>Of course, she had to think about what she would do after this. She couldn’t really keep this a secret from Amanda, but telling her, after her rant at the pizza place last week… That was going to be quite the conversation! However, that was something to worry about later. Right now, she could enjoy the time she had.<br><br>That’s when Lola entered the room again.<br><br>‶Are you enjoying yourself?‶ she asked with a smirk.<br><br>‶Yes… I am actually enjoying myself a whole lot,‶ Erin admitted. Whether this was the alcohol speaking or not, she couldn’t tell but it didn’t matter. What mattered was how she felt at that moment.<br><br>‶Well, that’s fantastic to hear!‶ Lola said, giving her a thumbs-up.<br><br>‶Actually… may I ask something?‶ There was something on Erin’s mind since the evening began, and there was no better way to find out about it.<br><br>‶Ah, sure?‶<br><br>‶Well… I’ve been in here alone so far. Is that… well, why is that? Am I just… a weirdo?‶ Erin eyed the waitress uncomfortably, and she was rather flustered. Of course, she was already flustered by the fact that she was sitting there in her underwear so this new blush probably wasn’t too noticeable comparatively.<br><br>Lola chuckled. ‶Don’t worry, madam - you are far from the only one. We usually get around one to three different guests on weekdays. Weekends tend to be busier. True, there’s some regulars, but I can’t tell you how many different faces I’ve seen in here so far,‶ she explained.<br><br>‶So… I’m not the only one?‶ Erin asked.<br><br>Lola’s motherly smile from earlier returned to her again.<br><br>‶Not at all, no. And don’t worry - you are not a slut, or weak, or anything bad. If anything, you are strong and brave for doing this.‶<br><br>‶Strong… and brave…‶ Erin repeated to herself. It was so hard to believe. How could she be strong and brave when she felt so weak and vulnerable without her clothes. But then again… Lola did have a good point. She was doing something incredibly brave. Something she never thought she’d dare do until tonight.<br><br>‶Thank you, Lola… for pushing me a little bit earlier‶ she said then.<br><br>‶Hey, that’s part of my job description,‶ the waitress chuckled. ‶I’m here to serve you food and help you unwind, so that’s exactly what I’m doing. Speaking of which…‶ she then held out her trusty pen and notepad again.<br><br>It took Erin a few moments to realize that Lola must have noticed her empty wine glass. She’d already downed two glasses now and the waitress was probably thinking she would want a third refill. Either that, or Lola just really wanted to get her completely naked before the end of tonight. It made Erin wonder whether Lola was really just doing this because it was her job, or because she simply enjoyed seeing nude people. Regardless, a part of Erin wanted to go along and order a new glass of wine, but… no. She knew she had to stop ordering wine, but not to protect her last two pieces of clothing. Wine was nice, but she didn’t want to get drunk on it.<br><br>‶I… would like a glass of orange juice, please,‶ she said. She once again surprised herself by saying that.<br><br>Eagerly, Lola jotted down the new order.<br><br>‶Well, looks like I’m going to get you fully nude yet,‶ she grinned.<br><br>‶And…‶ Erin started.<br><br>‶... And?‶ Lola asked, surprised.<br><br>‶And… a coffee… for after my dessert,‶ she said as she stood up. She had gotten this far. She was already going to take off either her bra or her panties. She might as well finish it all off now. Thus, she reached behind her back and did something she never thought she’d do in a restaurant. She unclasped her bra. It was so simple. Uselessly, her bra slid off her chest, fully exposing her pert breasts and her rather hard nipples to Lola. After she handed it over to the waitress, she bent over and slid her panties down her hips, exposing her wet, womanly folds as well. At the same time, she was giving the unseen people a perfectly good view of her ass, and she knew it too. Stepping out of her panties, she handed them too to Lola. This was it. She was fully naked now, and there was no crawling back.<br><br>‶Well…‶ Lola started but it seemed that Erin’s action had taken her quite by surprise, leaving her speechless. Erin could feel her eyes dart all over her body. She was looking at her breasts, at her hips, at her vagina, and Erin was loving it. She could even see a hint of a blush on Lola’s face. Finally, after a solid minute, she wrote down the final order.<br><br>‶I… will be right back,‶ she finally said, leaving the room with Erin’s underwear in her hand.<br><br>And that was that. Erin was now fully naked. All of her clothes were taken elsewhere, out of her reach. There was no way for her to get clothed again of her own volition. If she wanted to get clothed again, she had to depend on Lola to return her clothes to her. Just a few feet away from her, her best friend was having dinner with her boyfriend, unable to see Erin at all. Behind her, there were quite likely people watching her, eyeing her entire nude body in all of its glory. Well, they got to see her from behind. Of course, she could change that easily, and so she did. She was feeling so amazingly great at that point. She wanted to explore this side of herself fully now. Thus, she turned around and looked directly into the mirror at herself. She actually found that she wanted to twirl around some more too and give them a bit of a show. She was a changed woman.<br><br><br><br>A few minutes later, Lola re-entered the room with the promised orange juice as well as the tiramisu. There was a huge smile plastered all over her face.<br><br>‶I’m sorry for leaving so abruptly earlier, madam,‶ she said.<br><br>   ‶Please… call me Erin. And, really… it’s okay,‶ the brunette said, sounding a lot more confident now than she had before.<br><br>   ‶Heh… Erin then,‶ the waitress replied, placing down the new orders and picking up the used plates and glass. ‶I don’t think I even need to ask if you’re enjoying yourself here.‶<br><br>   Erin laughed. ‶I don’t think I’ve ever let myself go in this manner!‶ she said excitedly.<br><br>   Lola laughed as well. ‶And the food?‶<br><br>   ‶It is delicious!‶ Erin replied.<br><br>   ‶Excellent! That’s what we like to hear. I’ll bring you your coffee later so enjoy your dessert in the nude in the meantime.‶<br><br>   ‶Oh, I will,‶ the brunette said.<br><br>   ‶I know you will,‶ Lola replied, winking.<br><br>   Sitting down with her bare ass on the soft cushioned chair, the cold wooden back of the chair touching her backside, the wetness between her legs, it was all part of the experience. An experience she was pretty sure she was sharing with others. However… a part of her wanted something else.<br><br>   ‶Actually… Lola?‶ she asked, just before the waitress had left the room again.<br><br>   ‶Yes?‶<br><br>   ‶Would… you like to join me?‶<br><br>   ‶Join you?‶<br><br>   ‶At my table, I mean. I would… like to get to know you better,‶ Erin asked. It was true. Lola had been a rather intriguing personality, and she would probably be a lot of fun to talk to. Of course, the fact that she would be sitting naked at a table together with a clothed woman was also quite appealing to her.<br><br>   Lola waited a few moments before answering. ‶I… will return in a moment then,‶ she said as she left the room.<br><br>   Erin took this opportunity to take a bite out of her tiramisu. As she had suspected, it was one of the best she had ever tasted. It was so rich in flavour, and it had such a soft texture. As she was slowly eating it, and occasionally sipping her orange juice, she decided to take a look at Amanda again. They were eating just about finishing up their meals and were currently looking over the dessert menu themselves. Erin noticed also that Amanda was occasionally glancing to her phone. It struck the brunette then that she was probably trying to text her. In all of the excitement, she had forgotten that she had put her phone in the pocket of her coat. The coat that she had given to Louise at the start of this evening. She should probably ask about it when Lola reappeared. After all, Erin had no clue where all of her stuff had been taken. Were they taken to a special place? Or were they simply stored in a box? The fact that she did not know where her clothes were was rather arousing. Well, pretty much everything about this experience was arousing.<br><br>   ‶I’m back,‶ Lola said, re-emerging from the doorway. She had brought with her a tray with two coffee cups. She placed it down on the table next to Erin’s tiramisu and then sat down on the chair opposite to Erin. She seemed very happy and excited alright. Something about her made Erin forget about her phone again.<br><br>   ‶I’m sorry if this was an odd request,‶ Erin said, finishing off her dessert.<br><br>   ‶Not at all, Erin,‶ Lola chuckled. ‶Granted though, you are the first to ask me this.‶<br><br>   ‶I was wondering… how did you… well, perhaps I should ask why you got this job,‶ Erin asked. Despite her transformation into the woman she was now, she was still stumbling over her words.<br><br>   ‶Heh, funny story actually. My aunt is best friends with Louise, and so I got to talking with her. Then at some point, Louise told us of her desire to set up this restaurant, and I was very much intrigued. I asked if she’d need help and so here I am,‶ Lola explained.<br><br>   ‶Intrigued? Did you just want to see people nude?‶ Erin asked, taking a sip from her coffee. Was it really just that Lola was a pervert?<br><br>   ‶Well, that and more. I loved the idea of going around in a maid outfit like this, and Louise did always say I can be quite persuasive, which made this job all the more appealing to me. Seeing people nude is a nice bonus, but what I really enjoy seeing is their excitement. Your excitement. The way you’ve slowly opened up throughout the evening is what I really enjoy seeing,‶ Lola said as she dipped a cookie into her coffee.<br><br>   ‶Really? Heh,‶ Erin chuckled. ‶And have you ever, uhm, stripped like this as well yourself?‶<br><br>   ‶Ah… no. No I haven’t. Stripping is not for me. I’m more of a voyeur,‶ Lola admitted. True, ever since the waitress had joined her at the table, Erin noticed that her eyes were constantly going down to her breasts. something that the brunette actually thought was quite enjoyable.<br><br>   Erin laughed. Despite all of her persuasions and teases, the waitress would not go naked herself.<br><br>‶What sort of people tend to come here?‶<br><br>   ‶All sorts, really,‶ Lola started, eating her cookie. ‶You have the regulars. They’re the ones who already know what they like. They usually order everything at once so they can strip as soon as possible. Then there’s new people like you. The curious type who aren’t sure yet whether they would like this or not. Most end up liking it, but there have been some who decided they’d had enough shortly after they arrived. There’s the nudists who aren’t in it for the pleasure, but rather, they just need to be naked every once in a while. Finally, and this is my favourite type, there’s the couples. Couples, daring each-other to order just one more thing, seeing who will be naked first…‶ she trailed off a little bit then, probably thinking of some other experiences from the past.<br><br>   ‶That’s… wow!‶ Erin said. There were so many people like her. So many people who were enjoying this as much as she was. Maybe even more! ‶And, are they all women? Or men? Or…‶<br><br>   ‶It’s a mixed bag, really. I’ve seen it all. Men, women and anything in between,‶ Lola chuckled.<br><br>   ‶Amazing…‶ Erin said, sipping her coffee again.<br><br>   ‶You should come here on weekends. Like I said, it gets fairly crowded in here, so you can see what sort of other people are into this,‶ Lola said.<br><br>   Erin thought about that. She had to admit, sitting here with a bunch of other people, all in various states of undress, did not really sound all that appealing to her. Perhaps that was because there were so many people then who could see her? No, that wasn’t it. She had actually gotten very aroused by the idea that there might be a lot of people watching her. That left only one conclusion. If there were so many naked people around her, being naked herself would no longer feel special.<br><br>‶I think I’d rather return on another weekday,‶ she said.<br><br>   ‶Ah, right. You’d rather be the only one who’s naked, huh?‶ Lola teased.<br><br>   Erin blushed. Was the waitress reading her mind or something? ‶You know a lot about this, huh?‶<br><br>   ‶Well, I kinda have to. Like I said, this is my job,‶ Lola chuckled. ‶You’re filled with questions, aren’t you?‶<br><br>   ‶I guess so… it’s just, everything about this… it’s just so out there. I never in a million years thought I’d be doing this,‶ Erin said.<br><br>   ‶That is what makes this feel so incredible for you. You are currently sitting here, completely naked, in a restaurant full of people. You’re not supposed to be naked in a restaurant, and you’re certainly not supposed to be naked in front of so many people, at least by society’s standards. But that’s just it! Something that’s forbidden becomes more appealing. This is so different from what you are used to, something so crazy and forbidden that you can’t help but be aroused by it. Heck, even me telling you all of this is turning you on right now, isn’t it?‶<br><br>   Erin blushed madly. It was true too. She had gotten noticeably wetter ever since Lola had joined her at her table, and this conversation wasn’t really making things any better. Thus, she just nodded as her smile simply grew bigger and bigger.<br><br>   ‶And that is all I need to see to bring me joy in all of this,‶ Lola laughed.<br><br>‶I’ve… noticed you staring at my body a lot. Are you… are you a lesbian?‶ Erin asked.<br><br>‶Bisexual more like,‶ Lola replied. ‶And I know you enjoy me staring. That’s what you’re here for, after all.‶<br><br>‶I…guess that’s true,‶ Erin giggled nervously. The fact that Lola was bisexual intrigued her somewhat. Of course, if she was bisexual, that would mean that she could appreciate both male and female nudity. Erin herself knew that she was straight, just like Amanda, but fooling around with another girl… a part of her was quite curious about what that would be like.<br><br>‶So… what’s up between you and that girl then?‶ Lola asked then, pointing to Amanda.<br><br>   ‶She’s… uh, she’s my best friend. When we got here last week… well, she got so offended that she stormed out again with me,‶ Erin explained. Oh, how was she going to explain any of this to her friend?<br><br>   ‶She just doesn’t understand it,‶ Lola nodded. ‶In this lifestyle, you need a friend who’s supportive. Someone you can confide into your fantasies and thoughts, so you don’t have to face this new side of you alone.‶<br><br>   Erin nodded, looking solemnly to Amanda, who was still glancing around herself every so often. A thought came upon her then. ‶Do… you want to do that with me?‶ she asked.<br><br>   Lola’s eyes got a bit bigger, just as she was taking the last sip from her coffee. Calmly, she placed the empty cup down and swallowed her drink as a devious smile appeared. The same smile that she had when she tricked Erin into ordering two things at the same time. Wordlessly, she got out her mobile phone and she handed her pen and her notepad to Erin.<br><br>   The brunette looked at it. Lola wanted her to write down her phone number on it of course. Though Lola seemed nice enough to have a lot of friendly conversations with, for some reason, writing this down held so much more weight. After all, she’d now have a friend who could help her explore a completely new side of her. Who knew what was to happen from here on out? It was unknown to her, but just like the unseen people behind the mirror to her left, the unknown excited her. Enticed her. Beckoned her. She wrote down her phone number, hiding it from the mirror. After all, she did not want any strangers to see her number and start texting her.<br><br>   Lola winked and entered the number on her phone. ‶And… added.‶<br><br>   ‶My… phone is in my coat. I can’t add you back just yet,‶ Erin said nervously.<br><br>   ‶Ah, no worries. I’m a patient woman,‶ Lola chuckled. ‶As for your friend over there. Well, she’s your friend, right? She should be understanding of your desires and wishes.‶<br><br>   ‶Hmm… I suppose that’s true,‶ Erin pondered.<br><br>   ‶Or else, you can just decide to keep this from her if you really feel like this would put a tear in your friendship,‶ Lola said.<br><br>   ‶I’ll… I’ll think about it.‶<br><br>   Lola smiled and stood up then, reaching for all of the empty dishes and putting them on her platter. ‶Anyway, I’m sorry, but I do have to carry on with my duties now. You can stay here for about another hour max. I’ll come back every ten minutes to check whether you’ve had enough or not.‶<br><br>   ‶And… between those intervals…?‶ Erin asked.<br><br>   ‶Well, you’re just going to have to stay here nude. Naked without any way of reaching your clothes,‶ Lola grinned. She certainly had a way with words. She knew exactly what to say to give Erin another boost of arousal.<br><br>   ‶I… guess so, yes,‶ she stammered.<br><br>   ‶Just don’t pleasure yourself in here. Masturbation and sex are prohibited in here. It’s a restaurant after all,‶ Lola chuckled as she reached the door. ‶See you in ten minutes, Erin.‶<br><br><br><br><br><br>Sure enough, every ten minutes, Lola would return. Only after the second time did Amanda and her boyfriend finally leave the restaurant. In the meantime, Erin had decided to stand up and walk up and down the room, making sure to give the people behind the mirror as good of a show of her body as possible. By the time Lola returned for the third time however, she sat back down in her chair, fairly exhausted. She had stayed naked like this for half an hour after her dinner was finished, and she felt that she had had enough for now. She asked for her clothes back from her new friend and awaited her return patiently. When the door opened again however, it wasn’t Lola who entered the room. Rather, it was Louise, carrying a small box. Instinctively, Erin gasped and raised an arm to cover her breasts. However, she quickly lowered it again.<br><br>   ‶Good evening, mademoiselle,‶ Louise said with a smile.<br><br>   ‶Ah… good… good evening, Erin said. For some reason, she felt the same kind of anticipation that she had felt the first time she entered the restaurant.<br><br>   ‶How have you been enjoying yourself this evening?‶ the woman asked.<br><br>   ‶I… well… it’s been an incredible experience,‶ Erin said, giggling nervously.<br><br>   ‶As I thought,‶ Louise chuckled as she placed the box on the table. In it were Erin’s clothes. ‶I must say, I was quite surprised to see your friend come here after all.‶<br><br>   Erin’s heart sank then. ‶You… did you tell her that… that I was…‶<br><br>   ‶Oh, non non non, I did not. Do not worry, that is for you to tell her at your own pace.‶<br><br>   ‶Phew,‶ Erin sighed. She wondered then why Louise was here. Was she in trouble or something? ‶Uhm… I thought Lola would bring me my clothes back.‶<br><br>   ‶I always bring back the clothes of first-timers. I want to hear first hand how you enjoyed your stay at my establishment,‶ Louise explained kindly. ‶Lola has spoken quite highly of you. She hasn’t seen some get as into this as you have in a while.‶<br><br>   ‶Really…? I thought… well…‶ Erin stammered, standing up and reaching inside the box for her panties.<br><br>   ‶Oh, don’t be embarrassed about that. Take pride in it, mademoiselle,‶ Louise chuckled.<br><br>   ‶I… well, she did make me feel really good about all this, yes,‶ Erin grinned as she pulled her panties up over her hips again before reaching for her bra. Dressing up in front of this woman felt almost as absurd as stripping down in front of Lola was.<br><br>   ‶She is very good at that, yes,‶ Louise replied. ‶But I am left to wonder something now.‶<br><br>   ‶And… what is that?‶ Erin asked as she retrieved her bra.<br><br>   ‶Oui oui. You see, my restaurant is quite a success, as I had already hoped it would be. I am now looking for new ideas, to make nights like these extra special. And so… assuming you will come here more often… would it be okay if we test some things out with you?‶ Louise asked.<br><br>   Erin pondered about that as she put on her bra again. Tests? Her mind raced with ideas on what these tests could possibly entail.<br><br>‶Yes… I would gladly join these tests,‶ she said then without hesitation.<br><br>   ‶Excellent,‶ Louise cheered. ‶We look forward to your return here then!‶<br><br>   ‶So do I,‶ Erin mused.<br><br>When she was fully dressed and in her coat again, Erin followed Louise outside where the peculiar restaurant owner waved her off. Even though she was now out in the cold autumn weather once more, she felt like she was in heaven. Already she was fantasising about her next visit to this wonderful restaurant, and of course, the new tests. That’s when she felt her phone buzzing in her pocket. She got it out and looked at the screen. There were a ton of messages and two missed calls from Amanda, and one message from her new friend, the waitress Lola. Erin sighed to herself. She knew that this moment was coming. She didn’t want to lie to her best friend. As she stepped into her car, she called Amanda.<br><br>   Almost instantly, her friend picked up. ‶Erin! There you are!‶<br><br>   ‶Hey… I’m sorry for not answering sooner,‶ Erin said uncomfortably.<br><br>   ‶Where have you been?‶ Amanda asked.<br><br>   ‶Well…‶ Erin started. She could go either way here. She could just say she had accidentally left her phone at home or something. However, that would mean lying to Amanda. Something she didn’t want to do. As Lola had said, if Amanda really was her friend, she’d be supportive of her.<br><br>‶So… about that restaurant, Chez Louise…‶ she said." }
