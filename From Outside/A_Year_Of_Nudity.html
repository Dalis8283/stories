                Jane had heard about Kramerville long before she moved there. It was a town of legend, a town of infamy. There were some people who didn’t even believe that the town was real. That this town was just a legend, but it was as real as any other town.<br><br>The reason this town was so infamous was because of it’s rather backwards views on women, and it’s bizarre laws.<br><br>Some people said that Kramerville was a town trapped in the 1950s, but Jane was soon to find that it was a town trapped in the middle ages, with only a 1950s appearance.<br><br>Even ultra conservative towns condemned Kramerville’s rather draconian laws, and rules. Kramerville had been the way it was since the early 1920s when it was founded. The town was founded by an obscure religious sect, which is why other towns and other governments couldn’t really do anything about Kramerville’s laws. Even though Kramerville was an American town, it might as well had been a town in a different country.<br><br>The town was slowly starting to get a little more progressive, even though the higher ups were Christians, people of other religions were allowed in the town, and just recently the town had accepted gay marriage, which surprised a lot of outsiders. However the town’s laws where still very hard on women, now women technically had all the same rights as men, but punishment for breaking some of the town’s laws were different for the women, than for the men who break those laws.<br><br>Men and women who committed major crimes like murder, or robbery were sent to prison outside the town. However punishment for misdemeanor crimes, were very harsh for men and women.<br><br>Men who committed minor crimes were sent to the town’s jail, and had to spend a few months (sometimes a few years) of hard labor.<br><br>Women who committed minor crimes were sentenced to the infamous and controversial Kramerville Women’s Correctional Facility. It was this facility that was the reason for the town’s controversy among outsiders. The maximum amount of years that women can spend at this facility was five years, the minimum was one year. Women sentenced to Kramerville’s Women’s Correctional had to spend their sentences naked.<br><br>There were pictures taken inside the Women’s Correctional, that showed the female prisoners either walking around completely naked, or wearing small smocks that barely covered them. Jane remembered how in the picture that she saw, many of the women wearing the smocks had to tug really hard just to cover their lower halves. The worst thing about it all was the fact that once each week, these female prisoners were paraded through the town’s streets.<br><br>The town’s rationale behind all this, was they felt that by stripping these female prisoners bare, these women would be so embarrassed that they’ll never commit another crime again once they get out.<br><br><br><br>Just based on everything that Jane has heard of Kramerville and their Women’s Correctional Facility, it was enough for her to know that she never wanted to move to Kramerville. So when her 25 year old boyfriend Tim (with whom she was living) said that he had to move to Kramerville, she immediately became nervous and apprehensive. She told him that moving there was a big mistake, but he needed the job that was being offered in this town.<br><br>Her parents were mad as hell when she moved out of the house to live with her than 24 year old boyfriend, and she was only 19 at the time she moved out. She was now 20 years old, and she knew she couldn’t move back in with her parents, she didn’t want to hear all the “I told you so’s” from her mother. She had no choice to move but to Kramerville with Tim.<br><br>She was not happy, but she loved Tim and wanted the best for him. They both got an apartment in an apartment building.<br><br><br><br>They lived in Kramerville for about six months without any problems. But then Tim started hanging out with this guy named Joe, who was a pot head.<br><br>Now Jane had nothing against marijuana, after all it was already becoming legal and many states, but she didn’t smoke weed herself.<br><br>When Tim got together with Joe to smoke weed, she had nothing against it. They had gotten so comfortable in this apartment building that they forgotten that marijuana was still very illegal in Kramerville. One day an old couple moved in the apartment next door to them, and the minute they smelt the weed, they called the police.<br><br><br><br>Jane, Tim, and Joe were arrested. Because Joe’s dad was a cop, he managed to get off with only a slap on the wrist. But Tim and Jane had to face the consequences of breaking Kramerville’s laws. Jane didn’t even smoke any weed, but because she was with Tim and Joe, she too had to face the law.<br><br>Joe tried his best to get his friends off with only a slap on the wrist, but nobody would listen. Tim and Joe both tried to tell the court that Jane was not smoking, but they would not listen.<br><br>Luckily for them, they got themselves a good lawyer. The court wanted to send Tim to the town’s jail for five years, and Jane to the Women’s Correctional for three years. Their lawyer managed to reduce Tim’s sentence to two years, and Jane’s sentence to one year. The problem was, Jane didn’t want to go to Kramerville’s Women’s Correctional at all! She knew about the humiliation that they put the female prisoners through. She would rather go to an actual jail for five years, then spend even a day in the town’s Women’s Correctional.<br><br>Her sentence might only be for a year, but the humiliation would last her a lifetime, and she told their lawyer this.<br><br>“This is the best I can do for you!” Their lawyer said. “This is a very backwards town, but if you’re a resident they can pretty much do what they want.”<br><br>It wasn’t fair, it wasn’t fair that Jane had to go to this facility where she’ll be stripped naked. She didn’t even do anything wrong!<br><br><br><br>The judge announced Tim’s sentence, and then announced Jane’s sentence.<br><br>“You are sentenced to exactly one year in Kramerville’s Women’s Correctional, where you will be forbidden from wearing clothes. You will however be allowed to wear a smock from time to time, and you’ll be allowed to wear a sheet when you have visitors.”<br><br>Jane was in a state of shock, she could not believe that this was actually happening to her.<br><br>“You will also have to make a public appearance once a week.” The judge said, and slammed the gavel down, and Jane and Tim’s fates were sealed. Tim was taken away to the town’s jail for two years of hard labor, and Jane was taken away to the Women’s Correctional for one year of nudity and humiliation.<br><br><br><br>She was marched by the cops out of the court house, and to the bus. The bus took her off to the town’s Women’s Correctional.<br><br>Once she was there, they took her to a small sterile room, the room was cold. The walls were pure chrome.<br><br>“Please remove all your clothing.” The police officer who brought her into the room told her. She thanked God that this police officer was female. She knew that she was eventually going to be seen naked by men, but she was not sure if she would be able to bear it if she had to strip in front of a male officer. She was happy that if she had to strip, at least it could be in front of another woman.<br><br>It was still very embarrassing, she slowly stripped off all her clothes. She was down to her underwear, when the officer said- “I understand this is hard.”<br><br>She finally removed her panties, and then unhooked her bra. She dropped all her clothes in a metal tray, and took one last look at the clothes and realized that she won’t be able to wear any clothes for another year.<br><br>The officer walked her out of the room, she was walked into a big lobby. There were at least ten other women in the lobby, some were wearing their poorly fitting smocks, but most were naked.<br><br>Jane’s heart jumped up in her throat, when she saw that there were some male guards in the lobby. She quickly crossed her arms over her bare breasts. The officer walked her across the lobby to her room, some of the prisoners looked at her, but most avoided her. Probably because they were so embarrassed themselves. Some of the women however seemed to actually like their naked states.<br><br>Some of the male guards were clearly leering at the nude prisoners, but most were indifferent towards whether or not the prisoners were naked.<br><br>She was brought into her room, and found a smock on her bed, she quickly pulled it on.<br><br><br><br>During that first week in that facility, she learned that there were only about 20 women sentenced there. The crime rate among women in Kramerville was very low, because everybody knew about the humiliation that women who committed crimes would have to suffer. Most of the prisoners were there for the most minor crimes. Some where there for reckless driving, some were there for marijuana possession. Some of the women were there just for public drunkenness. One woman was there for throwing a fit in a restaurant. There was one woman there for assault, which was probably the worst thing that anybody did to get there.<br><br><br><br>Every Saturday the naked prisoners were marched through the streets of Kramerville, and it was the first Saturday. Jane was not sure if she was ready, but she knew she had no choice.<br><br>Any prisoner wearing smocks, had to shed those smocks before they loaded onto the bus which took them into town.<br><br>In their first six months living in Kramerville, Jane and Tim had witnessed only one of the prisoner marches. Jane had made Tim stay in for most Saturdays, to her what they were doing to those prisoners was too cruel. Now Jane would be witnessing these weekly nudity marches every week, because she was now a part of them.<br><br>The bus dropped them off at Main Street, which was crowded with people (who have all come out to see some naked women). Before getting off the bus, Jane looked out her window in horror at the people who had their cameras ready. The naked prisoners were ordered to lineup single file, and then they were ordered to walk off the bus.<br><br>“As you walk out, keep year arms at your sides.” The head guard said, “Line up in the street single file, and put your hands on your heads.”<br><br>Jane and the other nude prisoners did as they were told. They stood in front of all those people, and put their hands on their heads, so that they couldn’t cover up. Jane closed her eyes, but she could still hear the people laughing and taking pictures.<br><br>“These women standing naked before you!” The guard said to the crowd of people, “Have broken the law here in Kramerville, and now must face the walk of shame!”<br><br>The guards handcuffed the hands of each prisoner behind their backs, and each prisoner was assigned two guards to follow them. The prisoners were separated, and marched throughout different parts of the town.<br><br>Jane was taken down one crowded street, she still could hardly believe that she was stark naked in public, with hundreds of people looking at her.<br><br>Her entire body was burning red from the embarrassment, her heart was going a million miles an hour. Her heart felt as if it would burst out of her chest.<br><br>It was unfair that she had to suffer all this humiliation for such a minor crime. Even though she had heard about the Kramerville Women’s Correctional long before she moved to Kramerville, she still could not believe that such punishments existed in 21st century America!<br><br>“It’s just for one year!” She said to herself.<br><br>One year!<br><br>One year!<br><br>ONE YEAR!
