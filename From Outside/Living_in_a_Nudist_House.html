      { title: "Chapter 1", summary: " Living in a Nudist House", content: "Leslie was a university student, studying abroad. It was difficult for her to find the courage, having a very shy personality, loving the comfort of her own home. She had to grow strong, and luckily for her she even managed to find a lovely place near the university, with a very low rent, easing her troubles in this new adventure. And after a long flight, she finally arrived at her destination: a lovely white house, two floors high, very simple and plain but cozy in the aesthetic.<br><br>She approached the door, ringing the bell. Right away the door opened, revealing a beautiful young woman, with long blonde hair and dark eyes, dressed only in a pink robe. Coffee mug in her hand, she just admired Leslie from top to bottom, from her chestnut hair to the tip of her sneakers. Leslie was clearly nervous, expecting the girl to ask who she was, but then she found the courage to speak, introducing herself.<br><br>‶You must be Cheryl, I'm Leslie, I'm here for the room?‶ she said, with a taint of uncertainty in her voice. ‶Indeed I am, glad you finally arrived Leslie, was thinking you got lost‶ answered the blond, moving aside and gesturing her to enter the house. When Leslie entered the house she was greeted by a lovely house, having stairs right in front of her leading to the upper rooms, and two rooms to the sides. ‶Make yourself comfortable, just like you're home‶ said the homeowner, as she put down the coffee mug on an entrance table.<br><br>‶Thank you very... much...‶ Leslie started saying, with a pleasant smile on her face, that soon disappeared in place of a shocked glare. When she turned around to look at Cheryl, she was completely naked, hanging her robe on the wall next to the door. Even thou she never had thought of girls in that way, she couldn't lie to herself: Cheryl had a magnificent body. A prominent and firm chest, wide round hips, and a shaved and delicate private area. Not so private after all, actually. Her skin had no impurities, well tanned, she was beautiful just like a model.<br><br>‶I'm going to guess you didn't read the whole post about the rent and room‶ said Cheryl, who wasn't surprised about that reaction, as it has happened already before, loving the shy gaze on her body. Leslie managed to look into her eyes, getting red on the cheeks, and shyly nod as an answer to her statement. ‶As it was written, I'm a nudist. Don't worry, you don't have to get naked, depending on where in the house you are‶ she said, with a teasing smirk on her lips.<br><br>‶What do you mean...?‶ Leslie asked, confused by that last statement. ‶Let me give you a tour of the place and explain‶ said Cheryl, putting a hand on Leslie's shoulder, inviting her with a gentle push to explore the house. ‶This side of the house, where you can find your room, the bathroom and the kitchen you can wear whatever you desire‶ the blond girl started explaining, showing her the kitchen on the ground floor. ‶While this side of the house is naked only, and that includes my room, the living room and the training room. That's why the rent is so low: if you're not a nudist you enjoy only half the house, half the comforts‶ she concluded, showing her the living room on the left.<br><br>Leslie still didn't know what to think. She was glad she didn't by mistake sign to live a naked indoor life, but that meant no TV, no comfortable couch, and having to admire a nudist roommate. As she gazed towards Cheryl, another rush hit her, blushing harder this time, at the thought to see that lovely female body naked most of the time. She was still curious about the house, so she was taking a step into the living room, but as soon as her foot started to cross the threshold she heard something  she didn't expect.<br><br>‶Awk! No clothes! No clothes! Awk!‶. When Leslie looked towards the sound, after recovering from a tiny heart attack, she noticed a parrot, sitting on a shelf. Cheryl laughed, finding the reaction of the girl very funny. ‶That is Clark, my pet parrot, and he looks after the house and makes sure people follow the rules. Don't try to defy him: he bites and scratches‶ she said, patting Leslie on the back with a happy smile, loving to tease her, seeing how shy she was.<br><br><br><br>The day went on smoothly. Leslie went directly to her room, laying on her bed staring, at the ceiling, thinking she was having some sort of ‶dream nightmare‶. She was going to live with a nudist, something inconceivable for her. How could one person be naked and comfortable? As she thought that, she noticed the standing mirror in her room. Leslie stood up, gazing her thin figure, caressing and following her body line over her clothes, starting to think how it would feel. She only got naked to change or taking a shower, not giving it any thought, never gazing at herself.<br><br>As she stood there in her room, alone, she thought she might give it a try. The door was close and the curtains still shut, but even thou she still felt the need to check the room for any possible intruder. She grabbed her jumper, removing it very easily with one good tug over her head, having a white tank top still covering her. Her first thought, as she touched her chest, was that she had small breasts, not as good and firm as Cheryl. She swallowed nervously, unbuttoning her jeans and pushing them down her legs, removing her sneakers at the same time.<br><br>A glance to the mirror, noticing how now she was wearing just a tank top and her purple panties. A sudden blush made it's way to her cheeks, as she started turning incredibly red from embarrassment. The instinct was to cover her crotch, but she felt both embarrassed and stupid, thinking about how nobody was there with her. The idea to stop arose in her mind, but then another thought made it's way through. She was away from home, and promised herself she would be a better, stronger woman. And it was just being naked in her room, nothing special, nobody will see, but still a very decisive step into finding courage.<br><br>Leslie closed her eyes, holding the hem of her tank top, taking three deep breathes, and then doing it. One fast movement, and her tank top rose above her head, flying away cause she lost the grip. She didn't open her eyes yet, breathing heavily very nervous, as she put her fingers at the side of her panties, pulling them down hastily. Leslie stood firmly in place, with her arms on her sides, fist clutched cause of the tension, and slowly opening her eyes. And there she was, completely naked, socks aside, gazing at herself in the mirror for the first time.<br><br>Small breasts with hard nipples, and a little brown bush covering her privates. She didn't have a beautiful body, with such a pale white skin, usually people would tell her she was cute, nothing more. The gaze lasted only a few seconds, as she rushed to cover herself in embarrassment, letting out even a little yell. She took her clothes from the floor, and in a rush dressing herself once again, finding the experience stupid. Leslie just was tired from the trip, so she decided to fall back onto the bed so she could rest, happy she didn't have to be naked to live in that house." },
      { title: "Chapter 2", summary: "Relaxing on the Couch", content: "Living with a nudist has been quite the weird yet thrilling adventure for Leslie. It took her a few days to get used to seeing another person naked without blushing terribly hard. She was a shy and introverted girl, therefore very prude, and never seen another person naked, and could barely look at herself. She still remembered her very short attempt and adventure with the mirror in her room the day she moved in the house, but again, it wasn't for her. At least, that is what she was telling herself, as her thoughts kept going towards that curiosity.<br><br>She kept finding herself thinking about nudism every time she saw Cheryl. And not only about that, but even about her. Leslie couldn't resist the curiosity and the urge to gaze upon Cheryl's body every instance she could, always trying to not get caught. Not that the nudist girl wouldn't mind to be looked upon, that's for sure, but to not let her know that Leslie was having some sort of interest. So it was always weird and pleasant to stare at her ass as she walked up the stairs, did some fitness with the door open, or even at breakfast in the kitchen, since she loves to sit with her leg raised.<br><br>For the rest, living with her wasn't that bad. The house was close to school and many public activities, even thou she was displeased that she couldn't use the living room or the gym. Well, she could, but that would mean getting naked, something Leslie wasn't remotely ready for. But things never go as people would love to, and the time where you have to face her fears will come. For Leslie that day was a Sunday afternoon, and the great game was on TV. Leslie was a great rugby fan, she grew up watching matches with her father, a wonderful memory of bonding, and now that he's gone, let's her feel his presence.<br><br>For that thou, she needed to use the TV in the living room. Leslie stood in front of the room, admiring from far away the television, wondering if she would do it or not. Is the game really that important? Would she get naked just to watch a game? In reality, she was wondering more if she was a loyal roommate or not, cause Cheryl wasn't home, and that meant she might ignore the house rule and just watch TV, and hope the nudist wouldn't get home till the end. ‶Yeah, why follow the rules if she wouldn't know?‶ Leslie thought, deciding to be a little bit a bad girl, and break the nudism rule.<br><br>As soon as she raised her foot to do the first step, something caught her attention. ‶Awk! No clothes! No clothes! Awk!‶ yelled Clark, Cheryl's pet parrot, who had the job to make sure rules were followed at all times. Leslie forgot about the bird, until that moment he has been silent, was a very calm and docile animal, but very bossy when it came to entering the left side of the house. Cheryl did tell stories about other roommates that tried to ignore the rule, and how Clark started scratching and peaking them. Would he really do that?<br><br><br><br>She was so afraid to even test him, so it was better to follow the rules and avoid any problems, both with Cheryl and Clark. Therefore the question came back to the original one: would she get naked just to watch a rugby game? For her it was such an important thing, she loved the game, and it brought back good feelings and memories with her father. She looked around the house, as to check that nobody was there, something she knew, but still did. Decided to start easy, taking off her socks, something easy, she liked walking bare foot even at her childhood home.<br><br>Her looks fell on her jumper, and there she started doubting her choice. Yet she didn't have much time, the game was going to start at any moment. She started grinding her teeth, and with a tidy bit of anger she grabbed the hem of the jumper and took it off, letting it fall at her side. Standing in her bra and shorts, she started breathing heavily, repeating in her mind that she was strong, she could do it, nothing to be shy about. Nobody was home. She was alone. The hands moved with haste towards her shorts, pulling them down and stepping out of them, as her breathing kept getting faster, building tension.<br><br>Okay, she was in her underwear, and it was alright. She started calming down, relaxing, thinking how it's just like wearing a bikini, even if she wasn't a girl that loved swimming and show her body. Yet she couldn't find the strength to proceed, so she thought it was alright to go in the living room like that. She moved her foot forward, and again, she was reminded of the rules. ‶Awk! No clothes! No clothes!‶ yelled Clark, that seem to not accept underwear as being nude. Leslie sent a fast unhappy gaze towards the bird, but even amazed how he was so loyal to his owner.<br><br>Her eyes looked the watch on the wall, the game had just started. Leslie started trembling, conflicted with her thoughts and feelings, till the point where she let out a loud scream, releasing tension. She snorted, as she unclasped her bra and let it fall towards the ground. Time froze, as she touched her little perky breasts, covering them, as her cheeks started getting red. She was doing it, she was going to get naked (again) and enter the living room. Only at that point she realized something: if she did watch the game, she would be naked for a few hours, a very long time. Long for her of course, that would like it to be zero.<br><br>One last gaze towards Clark, that vigilant was staring straight at her, not letting her pass until she was naked. Resigned, she pushed her panties onto the ground, covering herself with embarrassment. Left hand on her crotch, right arm covering the breasts. She stood still, closing her eyes, feeling like she wanted to cry, but she had to be strong, there was nothing wrong. If Cheryl could do it everyday, she had to be able to do it for a few hours.<br><br>Embarrassed, she rushed towards the leather couch, jumping onto it as if it was a safe place, keeping herself covered with her hands all the way. She reached for the control and turned the television on, as the game had already started, but at least now she could watch the whole game. She relaxed with her back, but still kept her hands covering every inch she could, trying to focus on the match and forget about her undressed state.<br><br><br><br>And it luckily worked. The game started going and she was captured by it, as a great fan she was. At one point she was so into the game that she forgot completely she was naked, removing her hands from her body as she started cheering for her team. As the action kept getting more intense, Leslie leaned forward from the couch, without embarrassment, thrilled from the game. And when her team scored an amazing touchdown, she leaped off the couch, bouncing in the air, raising her fist and cheering with joy.<br><br>Only at that point she remembered about her state, covering once again her body. She looked around, noticing how Clark wasn't in the room, and Cheryl still wasn't home. But at that point, realizing she has been naked for a long while, she felt more at ease with her situation, sitting back on the couch, but more relaxed. Leslie smiled, she was happy. Her joy wasn't for her nakedness, but for the fact she was getting stronger, being able to fight her shyness. And as she kept smiling, she took her hands off her body once again, letting them rest at her sides.<br><br>Yeah, she was starting to be relaxed, and not seeing anything wrong. At that point she even wanted something cold to drink, and she stood up and going towards the kitchen. The fear to be noticed was strong, as she peaked out and looked in the corridor, confirming nobody was home. With a fast walk she went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and took a bottle of fresh water, drinking it on the spot. The cold air of the fridge was actually super nice, so much so she stood there for a moment, letting the sensation conquer her.<br><br>Closing the fridge door she giggled. It was started to be a great sensation, as if she was doing something nasty and getting away with it. Totally relaxed, she went back to the couch, even stretching her arms as she went, letting her breast rise proud. Sitting back she enjoyed the game, not covering herself, cheering as the game went on. So relaxed, that something unexpected happened. The camera focused on one of the players, the team captain of Leslie's team, a man she always found handsome, and had even a sort of crush on.<br><br>Without noticing it, her hand moved towards her crouch, as she caressed herself. A flush of heat started to conquer her body, as the pleasure started rising. The game went on, and Leslie kept touching her intimates, as her left hand went for the breast, with a gentle massage, pressing on her nipple. She stopped cheering at that point, even if her team was doing great, as her body was now focused on a new special activity. And so the match went on, and Leslie pleasured herself while thinking about the team captain, always so happy when his face was showed on camera. The game reached an end, and her team won, and in nearly the same exact moment she reached her climax, totally happy.<br><br>She was panting heavily, glad her team won, and even amazed by the fact she masturbated. Indeed she never did it in her life, that was her first time, and it was amazing. In her mind she complimented herself for finding more courage and becoming a better woman. All that security and strength thou, didn't last very long. ‶Enjoyed yourself?‶ said Cheryl, that was leaning on the jamb of the living room, smiling with a giant smirk, as she probably saw all. Leslie was so into the evening she didn't hear the keys turn, nor the door open, getting caught by her roommate as she was doing something shameful. Afraid, she jumped on the spot, hastily covering herself with embarrassment, unable to say a word.<br><br>Was could she say? She tried thinking of an answer to that question, but couldn't think of anything. She could tell the truth, but that would be admitting something she didn't want to. Leslie therefore panicked, as she stood on her feet, covering her intimates with her hands, and rushing out the living room. She passed Cheryl without second thought, rushed towards the stairs, and threw herself into her room, shutting the door with a loud hit.<br><br>The nudist just smiled even more, she knew the girl would enjoy that lifestyle, that freedom. She could tell that her roommate was very shy, but that she needed to relieve tension, as studying for school was indeed hard and stressful. She leaned to pick up Leslie's clothes, playing with them in her hand, as she kept smiling more and more as she kept thinking about that girl. Had to admit, she wasn't physically in shape but had a really cute body, and that red pale on her face just made it all even cuter.<br><br>Leslie on the other side, was leaning against the door she just closed, breathing heavily both for the tension and the little running she just did. The last things she wanted is to be discovered by Cheryl. The girl always loved to tease her, provoke her, very unsettling and unnerving, and now that she knew about this, she would press even harder. She didn't even know how she would find the courage to face her roommate without having an embarrassing discussion, cause Cheryl will surely bring it up constantly. Well, she was tired, so she decided to stop thinking about it, and just fall onto the bed, sleep, and see what will happen. She didn't think about the fact she was still naked, just slept, not knowing what will come the next few days." },
      { title: "Chapter 3", summary: "The Trap Vacation", content: "The tension between the two roommates was very tangible, anyone could sense it with ease. After being caught masturbating naked in the living room by Cheryl, Leslie was always embarrassed by just seeing or passing by her roommate. The blond loved to tease her, so when they were in the house together she would openly and directly remember her about that moment. Leslie was a girl so easy to tease and make fun of, and Cheryl was really squeezing any fun from it, every single last drop. But to be honest, even her felt she was being too cruel, pressing a poor young girl that wasn't used to such customs and world.<br><br>And that is when a brilliant idea came to the nudist, who thought of a way to let Leslie get some rest, and maybe enjoy herself more. When the brunette came back from university the nudist girl was already waiting for her, dressed with her robe, leaning against the wall and making her usual teasing smile, waving the belt with a sexy vibe. Leslie was really confused and afraid at the same time: that smile never meant anything good (actually yes, just embarrassing), and it was the first time seeing her dressed inside.<br><br>‶Hey roomie, was waiting for you‶ said Cheryl, with a sensual voice, teasing the girl once again. ‶Is there something wrong...?‶ Leslie asked, afraid there was something she had done, and something was going to happen.‶Nothing to worry about, relax! I just wanted to greet you... and offer you a gift‶ the blond laughed amused by how scared her roommate appeared. Leslie was still not relaxed, cause she knew Cheryl, she was a woman who loved to tease and pull pranks, that gift could be anything.<br><br>Kindly Cheryl gave the brunette the chance to relax, get a change of clothes and put her stuff down, rejoining in the kitchen to continue the discussion. All the time, Cheryl was with her robe, totally unusual, that kept Leslie suspicious. As soon as she sat down, the blond pushed towards her a mug of tea, just adding to the weirdness of that situation. ‶Look, I know I've been very harsh on you, about my nudism, your body, your adventure the other day‶ the blond started saying, indirectly making Leslie blush red, still ashamed of what she did.<br><br>‶But I really would like to make you feel at ease. So, as you can see, I'm already wearing my robe as respect, and wanted to cut all the jokes I make, and to show you I truly care, offering you a vacation together at the beach. Might be a way to even get closer and be friends. Oh, and as soon as we get back from the vacation I'm taking this robe off, it's my house after all‶ Cheryl explained, talking about how she wanted to be nice, bond with her roommate, and have a vacation.<br><br>Leslie was actually very surprised. Her suspicion was high, but then thought about how she was indeed wearing her robe, and the tone of her voice was soft, gentle. The brunette believed her, sipping her coffee as she gave the idea a thought, thinking of a way to test if she was honest. ‶So... maybe I can watch the TV in the living room without getting naked till then...?‶ she asked shyly, not knowing what she would say.<br><br>‶Of course you can, no nudism rules till the vacation. But again, after all will get back normal‶ Cheryl said with joy and laughing. Leslie was surprised, would the blond renounce her nudism completely for a few days before the weekend? Well, she wanted to enjoy those days before the rules came back online, so she finished her coffee and rushed to the couch, feeling so happy just being able to keep her clothes on, enjoying a rugby match. Cheryl watcher her roommate enjoy such constricted freedom, smiling devilishly as her plan was unfolding.<br><br><br><br>And so the weekend arrived, and it was time for the vacation together. Cheryl did indeed wear her robe all the time, being naked only in her room, and Leslie enjoyed the left side of the house with her clothes on. Now the two girls were going towards the beach, with Cheryl driving her roofless car, feeling the wind in their hair, already exciting for Leslie. Her eyes actually started to sparkle, when on her right she could already see the waves and the sea, excited to dip into the ocean and maybe read something on the sand.<br><br>They took their bags and stuff from the car, moving towards the beach, as Leslie started to get worried. The closer she got towards the sand, and the more she could see people were naked everywhere inside the perimeter of the beach. She had to imagine it was too good to be true, and somehow admired Cheryl for really trying her best to maintain a situation of decency for all that time. Well, if she was uncomfortable with one naked woman around the house, now there was a full beach to make her red, but not for a sunburn.<br><br>Dressed, the two girls reached the beach, laying down their towels and adjusting their umbrella. Cheryl with pleasant moans started removing her sweater with one fast blow, as she had no bra underneath. And with her hands one fast swoop and she removed her shorts, getting back naked and in her natural and most comfortable state. Leslie just admired, sighing in defeat, as she took off her shirt, pulling down her pants, revealing a one-piece suit she had underneath. She sat on the towel, already thinking about reading a book, but Cheryl stopped her.<br><br>‶I invite you to read the sign‶ the blond said, pointing in one direction. Leslie saw a sign that had written -Nudist Beach Only. No Clothes-, making her nightmare even worst. ‶I hear the fines they make are very hefty, don't think you want to pull out big bucks‶ the girl said, with an evil grin, lying down and catching some sun. Leslie thou didn't want to let her win, and decided to not take off her swimming suit, hoping nobody will come and fine her.<br><br>Sadly, that was not the case. Some people probably noticed the girl with a swimming suit and called a responsible of the beach. A man, completely naked and with his junk in full view, wearing only a cap, sunglasses and a necklace badge, appeared. The badge showed he was part of the security of the beach, and Leslie knew what awaited her. ‶I'm sorry mam, but I have to ask you to remove your swimming suit, otherwise I'll have to make you pay a fine‶ said the guard, even telling her the price, super expensive.<br><br>Leslie watched Cheryl nervously, as she was waiting to see the show. The guard pressed further, but the brunette stopped him, conceding to her fate. She looked nervously around, and many people were staring, making the situation even harder. Leslie slipped the first strap, letting her arm through, doing the same on the other side, doing it all slowly as she was hoping everyone would disappear. She froze, unable to pursue, even with the guard inviting her to continue and not waste his time, but someone else intervened.<br><br>Cheryl stood up, reached behind Leslie, and grabbing the swimming suit yanked it down with one strong pull. Leslie screamed out of shock, moving her arms fast to cover her intimates, and as she jumped the swimming suit got totally removed. ‶Nothing to worry officer, she's naked, and I'll make sure she stays that way‶ she said, winking towards her roommate, as the guard wished them a good day and left. ‶What are you doing?‶ yelled Leslie frightened and angry at the same time, sitting down hastily to cover her ass, and use her legs as a shield.<br><br>‶You needed help, so I intervened. Common, just enjoy the day‶ she replied, lying back down in her towel. ‶You tricked me into this vacation to get me naked, you're mean!‶ Leslie said, angry, but got scared once again when she saw Cheryl's face. ‶I never said this was a clothed vacation, you just assumed it. And I'm just helping you understand and enjoy the nudist life you are refusing to accept, cause you're afraid you'll like it and that would make you a freak!‶ Cheryl said, with a strong tone, in an imposing way.<br><br>Leslie didn't know what to say, and she just hugged her legs and put her head between her knees, defeated. Maybe Cheryl was right, that was her problem. She did enjoy that day in the living room, it was so free and amazing, even before the masturbation. Was she a nudist? Was she afraid to like that world? Strange thing to think about it while surrounded by naked people, as she was nude herself on the beach.<br><br><br><br>Was she going to spend all day like that? What a waste of a day she thought, so it was time to try this nudist thing. Shyly and slowly, she freed her legs from her hug, and lowered her knees, revealing her small perky breasts to the air. Leslie took a deep breath, and with courage put her hands on her knees, trying her best to keep them there and not cover herself.<br><br>As she watched all around her, she saw a normal world. People were walking like nothing, not staring at each other, nobody was glancing with a perverted smile her revealed body. Maybe there really was nothing to worry about, no shy and shame in being naked in a nudist beach. Living with Cheryl she did think being a nudist was synonymous of perversion, a sick thing for deranged people who just wanted sex or vulgarity.<br><br>This vacation was offering a new world and idea of it. Being a nudist seemed something quite normal, nothing to be ashamed of, freedom. As she thought that, she started opening her knees, revealing her privates too, leaning backwards and feeling the sunlight all over her heated body, as she felt aroused just like the other day.<br><br>‶I told you it wasn't that bad, and you like it‶ said Cheryl, turning around and admiring her roommate. Leslie instinctively covered herself, but it was just for a second, as she smiled with shyness and revealed herself once again. ‶I'm not a nudist, I'll just enjoy this vacation, nothing more‶ she specified. Indeed she didn't want to indulge in that life, just experience it for that day, as she was actually forced to be in that situation by her tricky and pesky roommate.<br><br>Feeling the ocean breeze on her skin was indeed a pleasant sensation. The other positive, even if she wasn't that kind of girl, was to have a great tan with no lines, something Cheryl was quite proud of all the time. The blond girl raised up, getting into a sitting position, staring at the pale brunette as she admired her body, loving it. ‶You need protection now that you don't have a swimsuit, let me help you with that‶ said Cheryl, as she took the sunscreen from her bag.<br><br>Leslie got a little nervous, closing her legs and getting rigid. She was enjoying it as long as nobody was directly staring at her, now Cheryl was there doing so, and even wanted to touch her naked skin. ‶Common, don't be shy. Remember, I invited you on this vacation so that we can get to know each other and bond‶ the girl said, as she started moving towards her roommate, positioning herself behind her.<br><br>‶You know, the best way to bond with someone, to know them better, is to be completely open‶ Cheryl started saying, as she covered her hands in cream, ready to put it on Leslie. ‶Being a nudist is just that, being free and open with other people. Since I decided to become one I've been able to worry less, and know right away who was a good friend‶ she continued, starting to massage Leslie's back, who was startled by those gentle and soft hands,<br><br>The brunette took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and decided to enjoy the feeling. Cheryl's hands were so delicate, smooth, able to dance on her back like it was an angel. Leslie knew she did massages, but never imagined it would be so divine. Without noticing, enjoying the experience, the girl opened her legs slowly once again, relaxing her body and exposing herself completely. Cheryl's hands reached her neck, and the sensations were amplified, a sort of weak spot that Leslie didn't know.<br><br>‶Many people came to live with me as roommates, but they all left or were kicked out. Boys would show their perversions, thinking being naked meant I was available. Girls would freak out, judge me, and not follow my rules‶ Cheryl narrated, giving a little background of past experiences with different roommates. Leslie was listening, and even understanding her point of view. Being naked meant that you would see how people reacted, showing their true selves, and therefore know right away if they were good people for you.<br><br>‶But you... you followed the rules, you stayed... and even tried it out‶ she continued, with a smirk of happiness on her face, as she kissed the brunette on the neck, making her gasp, open her eyes and turn around to see her. The two girls were facing each other, as Cheryl grabbed Leslie by the shoulders, creating a physical connection, as she stared in her eyes. ‶I really like you‶. The hands slid hastily from the shoulders to the neck, and finally to the cheeks, as she pulled the brunette towards her, giving her a kiss on the lips.<br><br>Leslie reacted instinctively, pulling away from the kiss. She stood tall, confused, not knowing what to do or say. Cheryl, still seated, was watching her with her usual smile, as if she was teasing her. Those words felt true thou, and even that kiss didn't seem something one would do just for fun. Leslie didn't know much about kisses, but she was quite sure that wasn't a friendly or funny one, it was intense. For her it was at least. ‶I... I...‶ the girl stumbled to talk, not knowing what to say, and her first instinct was to run away.<br><br>She didn't have a destination, she just strolled on the beach as she was thinking about what happened. What did Cheryl mean when she said she liked her? It was all so new and confusing, and Leslie was so into her thoughts she didn't notice a man in front of her, bumping into him. ‶Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I was distracted!‶ she said, trying to excuse herself. The man, a blond and in great shape guy, smiled at her. ‶No worries, I was standing in the way after all‶ he answered, as they exchanged smiles.<br><br>A second later, Leslie's eyes fell down onto the guys junk, as she remembered it was a nudist beach. And that she was naked too. Instinctively per hands rushed to cover her, one arm hugging her chest and the other to cover her crotch. The man laughed, introducing himself as Dean, as he made remarks on how that had to be her first experience in a nudist beach. ‶Wanna go for a swim? In the water you can hide your body, so we can talk easily‶ he proposed, trying to make her feel at ease, and have a decent conversation.<br><br>She nodded in agreement, and they walked towards the water close by, Leslie covering herself timid. They entered the water, and the brunette felt at ease to uncover herself, even because she needed her hands to stay afloat. The two swam for a while, even enjoying themselves as they exchanged some normal pleasantries, introducing themselves better, getting to know each other. ‶So, why were you walking so fast and distracted on the beach? Something on your mind?‶ Dean asked, worried and curious, wanting to be helpful if he can.<br><br>‶Well... it's sort of strange actually...‶ she started, rubbing the back of her head embarrassed to even say it. That was enough thou to make her think about Cheryl again, and the words she said. Being open, free, makes you see people for who they are. Leslie looked at Dean, thinking about him. He saw her naked, but even noticed her shyness and didn't force her to expose herself, actually trying to find a way to make her feel better. That is what Cheryl meant, of being open, knowing right away if someone was worthy or not, and Dean had proved to be a great guy.<br><br>‶My roommate wanted me to understand her nudist life, and I actually think I do now, thanks to you Dean‶ she replied, smiling towards him. ‶So you're going to embrace the nudist life now?‶ he asked laughing. ‶Oh no, not my life! Was pleasant for a while, but now getting nervous once again. After today, regular life for me! I hope...‶ she answered, and her uncertainty was about Cheryl and the fact she liked her.<br><br>She said goodbye to Dean, leaving the ocean as she covered herself, and yet letting the young man glance at her small but wonderful round ass. Cheryl was sunbathing still on her towel, haven't moved or left, as she just stared at Leslie who was coming close. The brunette was shy, as she removed her hands and stood naked in from of the blond, showing how she trusted the girl. ‶Sorry if I left, I didn't know how to process your words...‶ she said, as Cheryl took off her sunglasses, gesturing Leslie to sit by her side.<br><br>‶Don't worry, I can understand. I'm just glad you came back and nothing bad happened between us‶ the nudist said, with a honest and friendly smile. ‶I thought about the words you said, and I think I understand. You must have been victim of prejudice from many people, for just doing something... normal like this‶ Leslie said, watching her own naked body as she tried to understand her roommate. ‶And you've always been so nice to me, even if you are trying to force me to get naked... but you just want me to feel your world and maybe understand you. I like you too Cheryl‶ she replied, smiling in such a cute and sweet way.<br><br>Out of joy Cheryl jumped towards the brunette, giving her a strong hug, as their breasts pressed against each other. Leslie became all red, she could feel her roommates boobs and for some reason it was actually making her feel hot, she was aroused. As soon as Cheryl stopped hugging her, Leslie covered only her crotch with both hands, wanting to hide her arousal.. ‶So... are we friends now?‶ Cheryl asked, returning the usual girl with a sexy smirk. ‶Yes, we are friends‶ Leslie replied, smiling, as she tried to lay down and sunbath too.<br><br>The two girls spend some time lying down in silence, enjoying the breeze, the sun, and letting people admire both their bodies. After a while Cheryl stood up, inviting Leslie to follow her, to take a final swim before leaving to go back home. Without covering herself, but still alert of all the people around her and checking nobody was staring at her, she grabbed hold of Cheryl's hand and they both reached the water. Just like before the water was a perfect cover to hide her body, let her swim free, as they enjoyed some simple strokes.<br><br>At one point thou, Leslie got worried. She looked around, and didn't see Cheryl anywhere, it was like she disappeared. Was she pulling another of her pranks? The answer came soon, as the blond emerged from the water right behind her, hugging the brunette, as her hands embraced those small boobs. ‶Wha-?! Cheryl!‶ Leslie shouted, agitated in the water, in a mix of surprise, shock but even some fun in her voice. ‶Gotcha!‶ the blond simply said, letting go of the girl as she started to shoot water into her face. Leslie laughed and joined the blond, squirting her and swimming around, just having plain fun.<br><br>Time to go home. The girls left the ocean and returned to their belonging, grabbing everything and walking towards the car. Leslie was so relaxed, having fun with her roommate that she completely forgot to be naked, as she walked with Cheryl towards the car in the parking lot. Nothing to worry, since it was the parking lot of the nudist beach, so everyone there was chill, not bothering with the two girls, just checking them out.<br><br>Only when they loaded the car and Leslie saw her swimsuit she remembered her state of undressed. She let out a simple smile embarrassed, not covering herself but closing her shoulders and let her neck dig deep like a turtle. ‶Better get dressed before people look at us bad in the city‶ Cheryl said, throwing Leslie her clothes, as they got dressed there in the parking lot, no underwear beneath. And so the vacation ended, as they drove back home, having created a bond and become closer friends. For Leslie it was even an interesting experience, and who knows what this will mean for her." }
