      1: "Like many of the other trees in the surrounding area, the willow under which Erin stood was well established. Over 30 feet tall and with a width to match, its thin, flexible branches reached all the way to the ground. Erin liked this kind of tree; it was both soothing and majestic. Certainly, there were other trees she liked as well, but the weeping willow was her favorite.<br><br>She had stood under this particular willow at least a dozen times before. It had a distinctive pair of knots on its trunk, making it easy to identify. She had gotten to this spot from a nearby hiking trail, going straight instead of following the trail where it bent sharply to the right.<br><br>From this starting point she planned to head east through the woods, using the sun to navigate, until she reached a creek. From there, she'd follow the creek north until she reached a small, foot-high waterfall.<br><br>She liked walking off-trail through the woods. She varied her route somewhat, although she always stayed within the area she was familiar with. Her planned route to the little cascade was one she had followed three times prior.<br><br>Not once in any of her previous sojourns had she encountered another person. It was that, plus the sheltering effect of the drooping willow branches, which gave her the idea for what she was going to do today. It was a bold idea, a little crazy (or maybe even a lot), but if nothing else it was guaranteed to make her trip through the woods especially interesting!<br><br>Erin stood very still, listening carefully for any sounds which would indicate she was not alone. Hearing only the sounds she expected - birds chirping, insects buzzing, and the light rustle of leaves moving in the gentle breeze - she mentally nodded. Yup, she was alone.<br><br>It was late in the morning. She had planned to start earlier, but a couple of friends had called and they were both feeling especially chatty today. She could hardly have cut them off - not only would that have been a bit rude, but she enjoyed a good chat herself. Anyway, starting a little later wouldn't affect her plans.<br><br>She placed a gym bag she had brought with her on the ground, then removed her sneakers and socks. After folding her socks and inserting them inside her sneakers, she put her footwear in the bag.<br><br>That done, she pulled her light red top up over her head, folded it neatly, and added it to the bag. Her jean shorts were next. These were tight fitting, and as she slid them down her legs they attempted to bring her panties right along with. This she didn't allow, pulling the straying garment back up and out of her short's clutches.<br><br>That left her in just her undies - a bra and panties, both white. Now she had to make a decision, the first of two important ones she'd need to make before getting underway. Should she leave things as is, or should she go all the way?<br><br>She had already done a lot of thinking about this, but had decided to postpone the final decision. On the one hand, traipsing through the woods in just her underwear would be quite adventuresome. In the unlikely event she was caught, it would be really embarrassing, especially with the way her thin cotton panties hugged her hips. But this safer, more subdued approach paled in comparison to the alternative.<br><br>She pondered for a little while, giving time for her subconscious mind, where the decision had already been made days ago, to argue its case. It succeeded - she'd go for it!<br><br>She paused and listened again, breathing a little faster than before. Still no indication of any intruders. Moving hurriedly lest she change her mind (which she didn't want to do), she removed her bra with practiced ease and added it to the bag. One more garment to go. Grasping the waistband of her panties, she slid them down over her shapely hips. Then, bending over, she pulled them all the way down to her ankles. Still bent over, she stepped out of them, then stood up straight again. After folding her just-freed panties in half, she placed them on top of the pile in her bag, then zipped the bag shut.<br><br>The feel of the warm, outside air brushing against her was strange... strange, but not at all unpleasant.<br><br>‶This is crazy!‶ she thought.<br><br>But crazy or not, she had no intention of changing her mind now. Pulling her thoughts away from her nudity, she looked down at her gym bag. There was one more decision she had to make. As with her state of dress, there were two ways she could go: one bold and the other a little safer.<br><br>The bold approach was to toss her gym bag up into a tree where she'd be unable to retrieve it. Once done, there'd be no turning back. She'd have to traverse the woods stark naked until she reached the set of clothing she had previously hidden at her destination. In contrast, the safer approach would be to hide the bag in some undergrowth near her starting point. That would provide her with an avenue of retreat should the need arise.<br><br>Having already gone the riskier route with her underwear, she prepared to hurl her bag high up into the tree. But then she hesitated. She was already taking enough chances as is, without making it even worse. If for some reason she had to turn back, she'd really regret not being able to get to her clothes! An adventure was one thing, but foolhardiness was another. Walking to a nearby patch of undergrowth, she pushed the bag in until it was well out of sight.<br><br>All preparations having been made, it was time for Erin to begin her journey.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>Walking naked through the woods was unlike anything she had ever experienced. Out in public, yet hidden, it was just her alone with nature. The soft earth beneath her bare feet, the air constantly caressing her body, the beauty of her surroundings, and the pleasant sounds of the forest all made it exhilarating. To be sure, she was still nervous, and understandably so. After all, although the risk of getting caught was small, it wasn't zero. Yet the risk somehow added to the excitement. On top of this there was another feeling that made her all tingly - it was the feeling that what she was doing was quite naughty!<br><br>The sun sneaking through gaps in the leaves overhead formed tiny spots of light, like freckles in reverse, on her sensually athletic body. It wasn't only her hiking activities that kept her in such good shape, but also her participation with her school's track and field team.<br><br>Other than the miniature sunbeams impinging on her, the light levels were low, causing her dark brown hair to appear almost black. She had recently changed her hairstyle to a short bob cut - it felt good in the warmer weather, plus, according to her friends, it made her look super-cute. Her hair was complemented by a pair of dark blue eyes, a shade which was warm rather than steely.<br><br>The gaps in the leaves allowed Erin to ascertain the position of the sun. It was higher in the sky than was usual for her hikes; that was because of her earlier delay. Anyway it wasn't a problem - she could easily tell which way was east, and she headed in that direction.<br><br>Even in bare feet, walking was easy. The ground was suitable for it, and the undergrowth was thin at most places. Even so, she expected her trip to take a little longer than when she had sneakers on. She estimated it would take her about an hour to reach the creek and then another 20 minutes following it north - roughly 80 minutes in all.<br><br>As she walked, she stopped from time to time to look around and to listen. Although she was well hidden, her cover wasn't perfect. When she was inside the umbrella of a willow there were still plenty of openings though which she could see... or potentially be seen, should there be someone standing just on the other side. But trying to see past a second willow was much more difficult, and when the trees were three deep, with all their drooping, leave-covered branches, there were no gaps at all. Thus as long as there were just a few trees between herself and anyone else, she was perfectly safe.<br><br>Erin was mindful that with every step she was getting farther and farther away from her clothes. Should she need to get to them quickly, she'd be out of luck! It was an odd feeling, a type of helplessness she found strangely erotic. Suppose a large group of hikers descended on the area, coming in from all directions? They'd see her without a stitch on! Erin giggled, but only because she knew such an eventuality would not actually come to pass.<br><br>As Erin navigated around an area where the undergrowth was more dense, she realized that, despite the novelty of her situation, she was actually starting to get used to it, a little bit at least. That surprised her at first, but as she thought about it she realized it made sense - it was just a matter of growing accustomed to a new situation, something people did naturally. Anyway, it didn't diminish the pleasure she was feeling, but it did take the edge off her nervousness.<br><br>She took another check of the sun's position, adjusting her path slightly to maintain an easterly track. She didn't have to be exact in her heading; if she drifted a little to the north or south she'd still intersect the creek. Nevertheless, she wanted to stick as close to her planned route as possible. It wouldn't be the best of days for her to experiment.<br><br>Ahead and to the right, she spotted a cluster of three small pine trees. That wasn't unusual, for although the vast majority of the trees in the area were willows, there were still some other types scattered about. This break in the forest's continuity bothered her a little, but soon the pines were no longer in sight and she was again enveloped in a sea of thin branches reaching down from above.<br><br>Erin figured she had been walking for about a quarter of an hour now. That wasn't particularly long, yet it meant that, according to her estimates, she was already a quarter of the way to the creek. That didn't seem possible - it felt to her like she had just started her journey! She almost wished she had planned for a longer hike. In fact, so comfortable was she now with her situation that she actually started thinking ahead to her next excursion. ‶I'll have to do a three hour hike next time,‶ she thought. ‶Or maybe even longer!‶<br><br>But then Erin heard a rustling sound from directly behind her and all her nervousness came instantly flooding back, accompanied by a large jolt of adrenaline. She whipped herself around, but all she saw behind her were willow leaves. Acutely aware of her nakedness, she turned back around and began to trot forward, wanting to put some distance between her and the source of the sound.<br><br>She nearly jumped out of her skin when her eyes caught movement off to the side! But it was just a squirrel darting up a tree. Feeling relieved, and a little silly, she came to a stop. Smiling, she thought, ‶So THAT's all it was!‶<br><br>When she heard the rustling sound again - louder this time - she immediately realized her mistake: the squirrel had been off to the side, but the sound had come from behind her! She began to run forward while looking back over her shoulder.<br><br>Whoops!<br><br>Erin hadn't been paying close enough attention to where she was going and had snagged her foot on a vine creeping along the ground. She stumbled, but fortunately didn't topple over. She bent down to free her foot from the plant.<br><br><THWUUUUMMMP><br><br>Something hard had just rammed right into her butt!<br><br>Erin fell unceremoniously forward, nearly planting her face right into the forest floor. Surprised and annoyed, she twisted herself around on the ground and looked behind her.<br><br>‶Huh?‶<br><br>Erin's declaration of puzzlement was understandable, for there, staring back at her with two black, unblinking eyes in a pale white face, was a sheep!<br><br>‶What the...?‶<br><br>If, prior to her hike, Erin had compiled a list of things she thought she might see during her journey, a sheep would not have been included.<br><br>It was a full-grown sheep, not a lamb, and since it didn't have horns Erin assumed it was female. It had a coat of snow-white wool, not particularly thick, arranged so neatly that it might have been groomed. It had a pink ribbon, complete with a bow, around its neck, adding support to Erin's gender diagnosis.<br><br>Erin got to her feet, staring at the creature which in turn continued staring at her. There were a number of questions going through her mind, and she posed one of them to her new companion:<br><br>‶What'd you do that for?‶<br><br>She knew that rams sometimes butted heads, but why would a girl sheep do that?<br><br>The sheep's answer wasn't particularly helpful:<br><br>‶BAAAAAAaaaaaaaa‶<br><br>The situation, already pretty bizarre, got even stranger when Erin heard a young girl's voice calling out in the distance:<br><br>‶Fluuuuuuuufffffy? Where are you, Fluffy?‶<br><br>This was a bit much for Erin to process. Apparently there was a girl who had a pet sheep. Fine. The pet's name was Fluffy. A bit too cute, maybe, but whatever. And the girl took her sheep for walks in the woods. Uhhhh... seriously?<br><br><THWUUUUMMMP><br><br>While Erin was pondering, the sheep had apparently snuck around behind her. Although she didn't fall over, the impact to her tail end knocked her forward a few steps.<br><br>‶Now cut that out!!!‶ Erin instructed, as she rubbed her bottom.<br><br>‶BAAAAAAaaaaaaaa‶<br><br>Not wanting any further butts, and not wanting to be caught by the creature's owner, Erin decided it was time to vacate the premises. But as she turned to run away, Fluffy charged right toward her!<br><br>‶Yipes!‶<br><br>Erin picked up her pace and started zigzagging to thwart Fluffy's obvious goal.<br><br>‶BAAAAAAaaaaaaaa‶<br><br>Target in sight, Fluffy followed with great enthusiasm, her four legs a blur. It probably didn't help the situation that Fluffy's target was wriggling vigorously as Erin retreated.<br><br>‶Fluuuuuuuufffffy?‶<br><br>The girl called again as the pursuit continued. Unfortunately, Fluffy was more interested in Erin's backside than listening to her master.<br><br>Happily for Erin, she was able to use her athletic prowess to soon put some distance between herself and her pursuer. Eventually, a disappointed Fluffy gave up on the chase.<br><br>While Erin stopped to take a breather, for she had gotten winded from running so hard, she could hear the girl still calling from time to time. Although Erin wasn't thrilled that someone else was in the area, the girl was far enough away that she didn't have to worry about being seen.<br><br>But as Erin rested, the girl's voice gradually got closer. Although she would have preferred to have rested a little longer, she couldn't risk staying there. Just as she started walking away, Erin heard the girl greeting her pet in a bubbly voice:<br><br>‶THERE you are! Where'd you get to, sweetie? Let's go home now - it's time for din-dins!‶<br><br>‶Din-dins?‶ Erin thought. ‶I thought sheep ate grass? Does Fluffy have her very own little meadow? It wouldn't surprise me, the way that girl talks to her.‶<br><br>In any case, Erin was glad to be away from the bunophilic sheep.<br><br>With that thought, she frowned slightly and stopped. ‶Hmmm... Is bunophilic a word? Well if not, it should be!‶<br><br>She decided to check, and reached for her phone.<br><br>‶Oh.‶<br><br>With the realization that neither her phone nor its containing pocket was currently available, Erin abandoned her effort.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>With her strange encounter behind her, it was time for Erin to get back to the business at hand. She had apparently entered an especially dense cluster of trees, for it was considerably darker than before. Not a problem - she just needed to check the position of the sun and head east again.<br><br>But as she looked up through a gap in the leaves overhead, she couldn't see the sun, and it was immediately obvious why: clouds had rolled in and blocked it out!<br><br>Recalling the weather forecast she had heard earlier in the morning, she thought, ‶But it wasn't supposed to get cloudy until this evening!‶ Apparently some clouds had come in ahead of schedule. That was a bit of a problem. No, that was a HUGE problem. After zigzagging all over the place to avoid Fluffy, Erin didn't have the faintest idea which direction she was facing.<br><br>Now what?<br><br>‶Don't panic,‶ she whispered to herself.<br><br>While her self-advice wasn't bad, neither was it particularly helpful. In fact, she had no idea what to do!<br><br>She waited a little while, hoping that the sun would find a gap to peek through, but unfortunately it didn't cooperate. Had it been earlier or later in the day, with the sun closer to the horizon, she probably would have been able to tell which side of the sky was brightest and could thus have at least estimated the directions. But with it being late in the morning with the sun high up in the sky, she could get no idea at all as to the sun's position other than a vague, ‶it's up there somewhere.‶<br><br>Looking around her, every direction appeared the same, none more promising than the other. Recalling something about moss growing on the north side of trees, she inspected a couple of trunks, but alas there was no moss to be found. Anyway she wasn't sure if the ‶moss on the north side‶ thing was true or just a myth.<br><br>Stark naked and lost in the middle of a forest. This was NOT how she had wanted things to go! Well, all she could do was start walking in one direction. She'd eventually come to something which should help her get unlost. Maybe she'd cross a trail and could then follow it, although that would be less than ideal since she might well encounter other people. Or maybe she'd come to a creek or stream, perhaps even the one she had originally been aiming for. She'd just have to see.<br><br>Choosing a direction at random, Erin began to walk.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>At first Erin walked at a normal pace, not too hurried. She took the time to stop and get a drink at one of the potable springs which were conveniently scattered throughout the forest. Drinking it right out of her cupped hands, the water was cold and refreshing.<br><br>But after a while she picked up her pace. Her situation was not unlike drivers who, when they are lost, start going faster, perhaps subconsciously thinking that the quicker they go, the less time they'll be lost. At first she walked just a little faster, but then accelerated into a jog.<br><br>While she wasn't panicked, she was definitely nervous; she just wanted to figure out where she was! The weather refused to cooperate, with the clouds growing even thicker. It had gotten windy as well, with the sound of rustling leaves drowning out the other sounds of the forest. It felt like it might be about to rain, although that wasn't predicted to happen until tomorrow. That really didn't concern her - even if it did start to rain, it was plenty warm enough that it shouldn't be an issue.<br><br>Without warning, Erin suddenly zoomed right past a small group of people!<br><br>She knew immediately what had happened. She had just crossed one of the trails, and that particular trail was in use. She had fortunately run BEHIND the group, although JUST behind; she had been so close she could have reached out and touched them! Had her timing been just a little different, she might have zoomed right in front of them or, considerably worse, plowed right into them!<br><br>She had only gotten a brief, surprised glimpse at the group, but it had been enough for her to see that it consisted of four or five people - both guys and gals - roughly her age. It probably would have made sense for her to just continue running, but the near miss had really shaken her up. All aquiver, she stopped and hid behind a tree trunk, pressing herself against it and remaining shock still. Then she listened, frantically hoping that none of them had seen her.<br><br>‶What was THAT?‶ a girl's voice asked.<br><br>‶It must have been an animal - a deer maybe?‶ a young man's voice answered.<br><br>‶Did any of you see it?‶ the girl asked.<br><br>A series of negative responses ensued, to Erin's relief.<br><br>‶I FELT it, though - the air from it rushing by! It was HUGE!‶<br><br>The speaker's size appraisal, based strictly on air currents, was of course of limited accuracy, but the comment nevertheless brought a frown to Erin's face.<br><br>‶Yeah, it had to be bigger than a deer,‶ another speaker ascertained.<br><br>‶I think it was a bear!‶ the girl who had first spoken declared.<br><br>Erin was pretty sure there were no bears in the forest. The only bare nearby was her!<br><br>‶Hey, maybe we should look for it!‶<br><br>That suggestion made Erin's eyes grow wide. If the group decided to enter the trees they'd find her almost immediately, for they were only about ten feet away! Frozen in place, her heart began beating fast.<br><br>‶Look for a bear? Are you crazy?‶ one of the young men said.<br><br>‶It wasn't a bear; there aren't any bears around here.‶<br><br>‶Yeah, let's take a look!‶<br><br><Thumpity Thumpity Thumpity Thump><br><br>Erin's heart felt like it was beating out of her chest. She was about to be caught... without a stitch of clothing on!!!<br><br>‶Yeah, let's!‶<br><br>‶I don't know...‶<br><br>As the conversation continued back and forth, the wind died down, reverting back into a gentle breeze. With the sound of the rustling leaves now subdued, Erin could hear every little noise around her quite clearly. That meant if she made the slightest sound, the group would hear her. Then their discussion would end - they'd almost certainly investigate instantly!<br><br><Thumpity Thumpity Thumpity Thump><br><br>Erin could feel trickles of sweat running down her body. She couldn't even imagine how embarrassing it would be to be caught like this! How would she explain herself? She knew she couldn't - it would be total humiliation.<br><br>‶Just a quick look. I want to know what it was!‶<br><br>The sound of her own breathing seemed too loud, and she tried to breath more quietly... with limited success.<br><br>Erin heard the sound of leaves being pushed aside. They were coming!!!<br><br>‶But that's silly. Whatever it was is long gone by now.‶<br><br>‶Oh yeah, I guess you're right.‶<br><br>That last exchange turned the tide of the discussion, and soon all members of the group agreed to just continue with their hike, to Erin's immeasurable relief. What a close call!<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>For about a minute, Erin didn't move from her spot. Then, coaching her legs along, she slowly and quietly retreated from the path. At this point she didn't care which direction she went; all she wanted to do was to put some distance between herself and the trail.<br><br>Once that had been accomplished, Erin stopped to give herself a chance to calm down and also to think. One thing was clear: whatever she did, she had to be more careful! No more rushing around! She had been incredibly lucky - it would not do to tempt fate a second time!<br><br>Technically she was no longer lost, not completely anyway. If she followed the trail she had crossed she'd get somewhere she knew. Nevertheless, there were definitely still some issues.<br><br>The first was the trail itself. Where exactly did it lead? There was no way for her to know that, nor was there any way for her to know which way she should follow it. If she chose the wrong direction she could end up a considerable distance from where she wanted to be, for some of the trails went on for miles.<br><br>But even if she knew which trail it was and what direction to take, how exactly was she supposed to follow it? Obviously she couldn't just march down the center. That wouldn't do at all. In theory she could stay back in the woods, with the trail just at the edge of her sight, and follow it that way. In practice, though, that would be difficult, plus she'd constantly be at risk, for if she could see the trail, then anyone on it could also see her!<br><br>Then she considered an approach which would minimize her risk. Most of the time she'd stay back far enough in the woods so that the trail wouldn't be visible. Then every few minutes she'd get closer to it - close enough to see it, and thus get her bearings. But after thinking about it she realized that simply wouldn't work. The trails had too many curves. If she let it out of her sight it could be difficult - if not impossible - to find again. No, risky or not she had to keep it in sight at all times.<br><br>Putting her plan into action, she turned around and slowly headed back toward the trail. It didn't take her long to spot it. Then, watching and listening for hikers, she chose a direction at random and proceeded.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>Erin followed the trail for what she guessed was about an hour, having to crouch down and back away on several occasions to avoid being seen. She was starting to grow despondent, for she still had no idea where the trail was going. She couldn't just keep following it indefinitely - although it was probably only around noon, the sun would eventually go down. She did NOT want to spend the night lost and naked in the woods! But what was her alternative? Asking the next group of people who came along for directions? She'd have to be desperate indeed before going that route! Seeing little choice, she continued to trudge along.<br><br>If she got lucky, she'd come across one of the wooden signs providing directions which were scattered around the trails. That's all she would need; then she'd know exactly where to go! But unfortunately there weren't many such signs, so she couldn't count on finding one. In fact, as far back as she was, she might pass right by such a sign without ever even seeing it.<br><br>Erin glanced over at a solitary maple tree growing among the willows. She didn't pay much attention to it, being more concerned with keeping her eyes on the trail.<br><br>Suddenly, she came to a stop. Then she ran back to the tree and examined it more closely. There! A big patch of moss on the lower part of the trunk! She had seen it when she passed by, but it hadn't registered.<br><br>She walked all around the tree, examining the bark carefully. There were some other smaller patches of moss scattered about, but none like the large one she had first noticed. So was the large patch on the north side, as the adage she had recalled earlier stated? It HAD to be!<br><br>But then she hesitated. Suppose the moss wasn't actually growing on the north side? What if it was trying to deceive her? She gave it a penetrating stare, but the moss had the ultimate of deadpan expressions.<br><br>She decided she'd have to trust it.<br><br>Using her moss compass as a guide, she pointed herself to what she sincerely hoped was the east.<br><br>As she prepared to begin walking, Erin realized that it would be very difficult for her to maintain the same heading all the way to the creek. She'd naturally drift one way or the other. Nevertheless, her situation now was WAY better than it was a short time ago. She'd just have to try her best to keep going the same direction. Maybe she'd find another tree with moss on it along the way; that would be a huge help.<br><br>She had just taken a few steps when she heard a rustling sound ahead of her and to the right. Moments later she heard a similar sound ahead and to the left. Just as she prepared to retreat she heard a third noise, this time from directly behind her.<br><br>An image of three Fluffys immediately popped into her mind. Had the crazy sheep returned, this time with two of her friends?<br><br>Erin turned in the opposite direction of the trail and began to run. With the rustling all around her one direction of retreat was as good as another, and she didn't want the added risk of crossing the trail.<br><br>She hadn't gone far when she saw a girl moving toward her!<br><br>Erin let out a ‶Yeep!‶, changed direction, and accelerated.<br><br>She saw a second girl moving in her direction!<br><br>Turning again, Erin began to sprint just as fast as she possibly could, only to find herself headed directly toward a third girl!<br><br>The situation was NOT good. She continued changing directions to try to make an escape, but each time she did the girls would quickly shift their positions to cut her off. Like a noose tightening, they were slowly closing in.<br><br>It wasn't just the humiliation of being caught naked that had Erin concerned, for the girls all had odd expressions on their faces. She would have expected shock or amusement, but that's not the kind of looks she was getting. Instead, their faces looked derisive and mischievous... in a hard and unfriendly way.<br><br>One of the girls was tall, with dark, curly hair. From the way the other two looked over at her from time to time Erin got the impression she was the ‶leader.‶ The second girl was much smaller in height, and skinny as well. She had long blond hair, especially pale skin, and piercing blue eyes - not at all like Erin's warmer shade of blue. The third was of medium height and had wavy, light brown hair.<br><br>When the girls were almost within arm's reach, Erin made a final desperate attempt to flee, but was quickly grabbed by multiple hands.<br><br>‶Well, what have we got here?‶ the tall girl said, a sneer in her voice.<br><br>‶Get your hands off me!‶ Erin commanded, struggling.<br><br>Not only did the girls ignore Erin's demand, but they began to taunt her, calling her a pervert for running around without any clothes on and making fun of various parts of her anatomy, particularly those parts which would normally not be visible.<br><br>Erin's face grew hot and red with shame and anger. As she continued to struggle, she twice more insisted they let her go. Unfortunately it was obvious that not only were they not going to comply, but they were actually enjoying her futile efforts to get free. These were NOT nice girls!<br><br>Standing still now and doing her best to ignore the mockery being thrown her way, Erin waited, quite worried, for it seemed very likely that the girls weren't simply going to throw verbal abuse at her and then leave. Just what exactly did they have in mind?<br><br>Eventually the girls seemed to run out of insults; at that point the tall girl opened up her backpack and took something out. Erin's eyes widened when she saw what it was: a long, sturdy-looking piece of rope!<br><br>Erin renewed her struggles, but she was badly overmatched and soon found her hands tied securely behind her back.",
      2: `Keeping a close eye on their captive, the three girls moved a few steps away and began whispering among themselves. Erin wasn't able to hear what they were saying, but had little doubt that she was the topic of their conversation. What were they planning to do with her? She both did and didn't want to know!<br><br>After the discussion had gone on for a few minutes, the small blond girl whispered something which seemed of great interest to the other two; Erin saw them both nodding agreeably and could hear some sounds of affirmation, including a loudly whispered "Yeah!" and "Good idea!" The discussion went on just a little longer, and then the trio turned and walked back toward her, grinning most unpleasantly. Erin swallowed nervously and tugged at her bound wrists.<br><br>Positioning themselves just behind her, the three girls began to "guide" Erin along, prompting her forward toward some undisclosed destination. That destination was foremost in her mind, and the source of considerable concern. At the moment, they were walking uncomfortably close to the trail she had been following; she was able to catch a glimpse of it from time to time. Were they going to veer over toward it at some point, exposing her to anyone and everyone walking along it?<br><br>As they proceeded, her captors talked among themselves. Although they didn't reveal any information about their plans, Erin was able to learn their names: the tall leader with the sneering voice was called Claudette, the skinny blonde was Jen, and the brown-haired girl was Shirley. This information, while interesting, was of little value to her - after all, she was hardly likely to try to start up a friendly conversation with them!<br><br>The farther they walked, the more anxious Erin became. After a while she began to drag her heels and to generally slow her forward progress, first just a little, but then by a lot. In response, the girls, especially Claudette, gave her pushes from the back. But despite this, Erin's progress continued to slow until they were moving forward at just a crawl.<br><br>Claudette came around to the front of Erin and, staring menacingly at her, said, "If you'd prefer, I'll pick you up and carry you over my shoulder. But if I have to do that, I'm going to walk right down the middle of the trail. Your choice."<br><br>Claudette looked plenty strong enough to carry through on her threat. Erin didn't know if she'd actually do it or not, but dared not take the chance. She thus abandoned her efforts to slow down and resumed moving forward at a normal pace.<br><br>A beam of sunlight snuck through the clouds, bathing the area in a warm, yellowish glow. "Sure, NOW you come out," Erin silently groused. "Where were you when I needed you?" Sullenly, the sunbeam went back into hiding.<br><br>The group veered away from the trail, which was at least some consolation to Erin. Another thing that seemed promising was the nature of the conversation she was picking up from behind her. Although none of the girls had come right out and said it, Erin got the impression that they were going to simply abandon her at some point. She figured that, as mean as the girls were, they'd likely leave her hands tied, which would certainly present issues (and would also explain why they were so gung ho about their plan when they were whispering about it). Still, she figured she'd be able to find a tree branch or a rock and, with some work, cut through the rope and free herself. At least that's what she hoped - that rope had looked pretty strong. If by chance she was unable to free herself, that would be a BIG - and ultimately very embarrassing - problem!<br><br>The group continued walking, Erin obediently following the prompts from the girls behind her. She was biding her time, knowing there was nothing she could do at the moment, but fully intending to spring into action the moment the unpleasant threesome left.<br><br>An uneventful half hour or so went by. Then Erin saw another trail directly in front; they were headed right for it! She slammed on her brakes - despite Claudette's earlier threats, she had no intention of walking willingly right into an area where people could see her!<br><br>She fully expected a shove, or at least some new threats, but that didn't happen. Instead, Claudette simply said, "There aren't any people here."<br><br>Unconvinced, Erin didn't budge.<br><br>"There's a race scheduled for today," Claudette explained further. "Until the runners reach here, this trail will be empty."<br><br>That jarred Erin's memory. Claudette was right - there WAS a race planned for today. Erin hadn't intended on hiking anywhere near the trail for which the race was planned, but, provided Claudette was telling the truth, that trail was the one she was now looking at.<br><br>Realizing she didn't actually have any choice in the matter anyway, Erin took a few tentative steps forward. She didn't see or hear anyone on the trail.<br><br>"Once we reach the trail, we'll be leaving you," Claudette prompted.<br><br>That fit in exactly with what Erin had expected: they were going to abandon her. Their choice of drop points certainly wasn't to her advantage - she'd need to get out of the area as soon as possible. She didn't see an issue with that, though - she'd just back off into the woods and then worry about the rope. She really, really hoped she'd be able to get it off!<br><br>She took a few more careful steps forward. Something bothered her. Then she realized what it was: in contrast to her earlier demeanor, Claudette was actually being fairly civil. The ever-present sneer in her voice was even missing. Alarm bells began ringing in her head.<br><br>But then she saw something which confirmed that Claudette was being truthful. Just ahead, she could see that the trail split itself into two parts, one on each side of a patch of about a dozen oak and maple trees. That was a unique feature of this particular race which she knew well, having run several times on this very trail - the runners could choose which side of the stand of trees to take. There was no clear advantage to either route, so runners usually divided themselves fairly evenly among the two choices. After the patch of trees, the split trails rejoined into one.<br><br>More confident now, although still watching and listening, Erin walked the remainder of the distance to the trail.<br><br>When they had reached the tree patch, Claudette said, "We're here. Stand still and I'll untie you."<br><br>Well, that was unexpected. Erin had been sure they were going to leave her hands tied behind her back, but apparently not! They had sure rattled her cage, but fortunately that's all they were planning to do.<br><br>Erin's luck finally changing, Claudette freed her hands.<br><br>What happened next was literally a blur. Jen and Shirley, one on each side, grabbed Erin roughly and yanked her back against a tree! Claudette, being equally ungentle, then pulled her arms back behind the trunk and quickly retied her wrists. In just a few seconds Erin's optimism had been mashed into oblivion!<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>Stunned, Erin automatically asked a somewhat rhetorical question: "What are you doing?"<br><br>Surprisingly, she got an answer.<br><br>Claudette said, "If you're traipsing around outdoors with nothing on, you must WANT to be seen. We're just helping you get what you want."<br><br>Erin desperately tried to argue against the inaccuracies in Claudette's statements, but to no avail.<br><br>"Only pervos go outside naked," Claudette said, the sneer having returned to her voice.<br><br>"Yeah, that's right," Jen chimed in. "You're going to get just what you deserve."<br><br>Erin found herself wishing she was alone and untied with the skinny blonde. She'd see to it that the annoying brat changed her tune... in no time at all.<br><br>Shirley decided to add her two cents: "I'll bet you - and a whole bunch of other people - will remember this for a long, long time. Heh heh heh.<br><br>"But you CAN'T leave me like this!!!" Erin said, making a last ditch effort which was doomed to failure.<br><br>Claudette was looking at her a little oddly. She didn't react to Erin's pleading, but instead said, "I should have another rope."<br><br>"What the fuck would you need another rope for?" Erin thought silently. Things were quite bad enough as they were. An extra rope could hardly make things worse... could it? She was glad there weren't any more ropes handy so she didn't have to find out.<br><br>"Hey, what about this?" Jen called over to Claudette.<br><br>Everyone, including Erin, looked over at her. She was bent down and had a vine in her hand.<br><br>"Yeah, that might work," said Claudette, walking over to take a closer look.<br><br>Unfortunately, there were some vines creeping along the ground at this part of the forest, which Jen had spotted. Doubly unfortunately, some of them were thick and sturdy.<br><br>With Erin watching warily, Claudette pulled out a small multi-purpose tool and cut a generous length of vine. Erin felt relieved when Claudette put the tool back into her pocket, but her relief vanished just a moment later when Claudette approached her with the vine in her hands.<br><br>Claudette, with some help from the other two girls, pulled Erin's right foot over to the right side of the tree. Then she wrapped the vine several times around her ankle and, with some difficulty, tied it in a knot. She then ran the vine behind the tree and wrapped it around Erin's other ankle, which Jen and Shirley were holding in place on the left side of the tree. Claudette tied that into a knot as well.<br><br>When she was done, Erin's feet were straddling the tree. Her legs were spread wide, and the vine was plenty strong enough to ensure they stayed that way.<br><br>While Erin was struggling to pull her legs back together, Claudette gave her some parting words:  "Well, it's time we were on our way! Things to do, you know! Have fun!"<br><br>The sound of obnoxious laughter filled the air as the three girls walked away.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>Erin, still understandably stunned, took stock of her situation. The tree to which she was tied was a mature oak, its thick trunk soaring skyward. It was located right at the point where the trail split into two separate routes. She was facing the direction from which the trail approached, so that anyone coming along it would see her from the front. Tied and completely unable to cover herself, that would be an interesting sight indeed.<br><br>She looked down at the vine which Claudette had tied to her ankles. The knots looked pretty loose - if she could just get her hands down there she could get them untied in no time.<br><br>But of course she couldn't get her hands down there. Her arms were stretched out on both sides of the trunk, with a rope attached to each wrist. Her wrists weren't touching, for the trunk was too wide for that, but that didn't make her bonds any less secure. She tried pulling on her wrists, but Claudette had tied them very tightly. Not to the point of cruelty, but not far from it either. Claudette clearly didn't want to allow her any possibility of escape.<br><br>One thing that would help would be if she could maneuver herself around to the other side of the tree; then at least she'd be facing away from oncoming traffic. But with the soft flesh of her bottom cheeks pressed firmly into the rough bark of the oak, that was out of the question. She was going to continue facing forward, come what may.<br><br>Her thoughts turned to the race. She didn't know what time it was, so it was very possible that it had already started. Not a pleasant thought. It was an informal race, where anyone could compete. As a more serious runner, she hadn't been interested in it herself, but she knew that many other people would be. In fact, there would be between one hundred and two hundred entrants.<br><br>Until the runners reached her location, the track would most likely remain devoid of people. But once they did get there, they would do so en masse.<br><br>Erin looked down the length of the trail. Once the runners were in view, it would take them about a half a minute to reach her. Thirty seconds where she'd be showing it all. Even worse, as this wasn't a particularly serious race, some of the competitors would be carrying their phones with them in their pockets.<br><br>She knew that someone would untie her, but not before a great many people got a good, long look, and not before the event was preserved permanently in the form of pictures and videos.<br><br>She was going to be humiliated..... completely, utterly, and totally.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>Her adventure having turned into the worst disaster imaginable, all Erin could do was wait there helplessly for her fate. She understandably continued to struggle against her bonds, but with her movement so limited it was really more of a reflex than a serious attempt to get free. At any moment, a large group of people would come into view. Maybe she'd hear them first, or maybe not - she wasn't sure. In any case, she was going to have to stand their, her bare breasts jutting outward and her widely spread legs exposing her most secret parts, while the group got closer and closer to her.<br><br>She couldn't even imagine what this was going to feel like. She'd give virtually anything to get out of it, but that simply wasn't an option available to her. How could this have possibly happened?<br><br>She realized it was a combination of things - her late start, a psycho sheep, clouds coming in ahead of schedule, and, worst of all, the three incredibly nasty girls! It was an understatement to say that Erin was not feeling any fondness for Claudette, Jen, and Shirley.<br><br>Her thoughts shifted to an episode of an old TV program she sometimes watched. In that episode, a girl ties another girl to the lockers in the main hallway of a school. The girl is naked except for a towel wrapped around her, hiding both her upper and lower parts. There's a rope tied to the towel, the other end of which is in the mouth of a dog sitting nearby. The unfortunate girl is gagged, and her arms are spread wide.<br><br>Then the scene shifts to the girl who did the tying. She's at the end of the hallway, ready to leave the school. She calls to the dog, and the dog happily runs to her. The dog is still holding the end of the rope in his mouth. As the dog runs, the other end of the rope comes into view, with the towel still attached and dragging along behind. Just then the bell for passing classes rings.<br><br>Erin had found that scene to be pretty hot, but she could also feel for the poor girl (even though that particular girl wasn't very nice). When she saw that episode, she couldn't help mentally putting herself in the girl's place, thinking how unbelievably embarrassing it would be to be exposed like that! And to her own classmates, too! Well, now she was going to find out first hand.<br><br>"Oh..."<br><br>That brought something to mind that Erin hadn't thought of earlier: a number of her friends and schoolmates, both male and female, would be participating in the race! Her situation - more than plenty bad enough before - had just gotten even worse.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>An indeterminate amount of time went by. To Erin it seemed like hours, but she knew it couldn't really be that long, for it was only early afternoon. She could tell this because the clouds were starting to break up, allowing the sun to reemerge.<br><br>She was sweating profusely, but not because of the warm air. She was more nervous now than she had ever been in her life. She kept watching the trail, waiting for runners to appear, and her mind kept interpreting every little sound impinging on her ears as the sound of their approach. Could it be that this stressful wait would be worse than what was ultimately going to happen? She knew very well, though, that the answer to that question was an emphatic "No, not even close!"<br><br>During her wait, Erin tried everything she could think of to get free. Included in these attempts were pulling and twisting both her ankles to try to get at least one of her feet away from the vine. Even though that wouldn't get her out of her situation, it would at least allow her to close her legs, which she desperately wanted to do. With the looser knots in the vines, that was something she thought she at least had a chance to succeed at. But by wrapping the vines multiple times tightly around her ankles, Claudette had thwarted those efforts.<br><br>Another thing she tried, multiple times, was to push herself hard back against the tree to create some slack in the rope behind her. If she had enough slack, she thought she could rub the rope against the bark by moving her arms up and down, so that the friction would eventually wear through it. But no matter how hard she pressed herself against the trunk she couldn't create nearly enough slack. Her arms were pressed too tightly against the tree to allow her much movement, plus she had to be careful not to scrape her skin. On her most recent attempt at this, all she had managed to do was to move the rope a little bit farther up the trunk. Useless.<br><br>After yet another failure to create slack in the rope, she moved onto other things, all things she had already tried before. She tried pushing her body first to the front, then the sides. She tried bending all parts of her body which were bendable. Then she tried twisting things - her torso, her arms, her wrists...<br><br>Erin's right index finger brushed against something, and she quickly pulled it back. Was that a bug? She didn't have any particular issues with bugs, but neither did she want one crawling on her hand. She tried moving her fingers again and found what she had touched. No, not a bug. It was the rope. But what would the rope be doing out there, away from her wrists? And why had she just noticed it now?<br><br>She answered her second question first: apparently when she had managed to pull the rope up the trunk a bit, her bindings had been repositioned. She realized now too why the rope was there. What she was feeling was the end of the rope sticking out from the knot near her right wrist.<br><br>Exploring further, she caught the end of the rope with two of her fingers, then carefully reeled it in toward her hand. The knot! Her fingers felt the knot! Could she maybe loosen it?<br><br>Suddenly, her situation wasn't completely hopeless. She didn't know if she'd be able to loosen it, but she was certainly going to try!<br><br>If she had been dealing with something that had a rough surface, like untreated hemp rope, Erin wouldn't have had a chance. But the rope she had been tied with, while very strong, had a smooth, finished surface. That would in theory allow the rope to slide against itself without too much opposition. She frantically worked at the knot with her fingers, trying to worry the rope's end through the knot's tight loop.<br><br>If she could get her left hand over to help, she was sure she could untie it. But unfortunately the trunk was too wide; no matter how hard she tried to stretch, she just couldn't reach the knot with that hand. If she was to succeed, it would have to be with her right hand only.<br><br>It was difficult and awkward work, something she would have abandoned had she not been so highly motivated. She struggled and struggled, not making any apparent progress. The effort was making her sweat even more than before; it was running off her in rivers, spilling onto the ground around her feet.<br><br>While she worked, she kept watching for the runners who could appear at any moment. She could hardly help it, facing in that direction, even though it was a distraction from her efforts.<br><br>Finally she felt the rope move through the knot's loop, just a little at first, but then it began to slide more easily. Had she succeeded? Maybe, just maybe.<br><br>The knot had another loop that she now had to get the rope through, but she made quick work of this; it was child's play compared to the first one.<br><br>Yes! Yes! Yes! The knot was giving way! Freedom was only moments away... provided Claudette hadn't tied a secondary knot. Not a pleasant thought, and not unrealistic either, considering how awful that girl was.<br><br>But those fears were unfounded. With the knot open Erin was able to pull her hands out in front of her. She started working on the knot on her left wrist, but then realized she didn't need to tackle that one. What she needed to do next was free her feet, then she'd be able to get away from the tree and hide in the forest!<br><br>As she had expected, getting her feet out of the vine was easy now that she could use her hands. Thrusting the vine aside, she ran into the woods, dragging the rope which was still attached to her left wrist behind her. Once she had put a few trees between herself and the trail, she untied the rope from her wrist. Then she sat down for a short rest. She was exhausted!<br><br>She had only been sitting there for a minute when she heard a commotion approaching. It was the runners! Quickly, she got up and moved a little deeper into the trees. She was already completely hidden, but why take any chances?<br><br>Then she listened. She could hear the sound of running feet of course, but she also heard some talking and laughing. Those sounds wouldn't likely be heard at a more serious race, but for this one the competitors were just basically having a good time.<br><br>When she thought about how narrow her escape had been, a knot formed in her stomach, every bit as tight as the one binding her wrists just a short time ago. What if she hadn't gotten away? That whole group - a particularly large one, from the noise they were making - would now be seeing her stark naked! It had been SO CLOSE! Only a combination of luck and almost superhuman effort had saved her. She closed her eyes, bowed her head, and took a few deep breaths. She was fine now, but she needed to calm herself. She hadn't even noticed it before, but her heart was beating like the drummer at a rock concert.<br><br>She stayed there a while, then wearily got up. She was tired, thirsty, and generally a mess. But she was free! All she had to do now was head to her clothes. That would be a bit of a walk, but nothing too difficult - the clouds had dissipated, so she could use the sun once more to navigate to the creek.<br><br>Snuggled safely among the willows again, Erin began the final part of her journey.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>What an adventure it had been! Far, far more than she had expected... or wanted. Erin reflected on this as she came upon a small pond fed by a spring, bubbling and sparkling in a ray of sunlight sneaking through the canopy above.<br><br>She drank greedily from the spring, renewing the moisture she had lost as sweat. Then she slowly entered the pond. It was only a few feet deep, but that was plenty for her purposes. The water was very cold, but she really needed to get herself cleaned off. Crouching down, she immersed herself in the clear liquid, gasping when the water reached her waist. Before long, her entire body was submerged.<br><br>She didn't stay under long, just enough to swish around a bit. Then she stood up and got out of the pond.<br><br>"Brrrrrr!"<br><br>She was freezing, but the feeling passed quickly, replaced by a powerful feeling of youthful vigor. She felt as good as new!<br><br>It was time to get going again. She walked to the other side of the pond, and then noticed something she hadn't seen before: a swing. It was simply a flat board attached to an overhead tree branch by two ropes. One of the ropes was broken. Once it was repaired, it would be a peaceful and pleasant place to sit, swinging gently in the shade with a nice view of the pond.<br><br>Then she noticed a narrow dirt path leading away from the swing. Under other circumstances she'd be a little curious about where it led, but certainly not now. She began to walk away, heading in the direction of the creek.<br><br>She came to a stop.<br><br>That swing had had a broken rope. Claudette had been carrying a rope. Was it possible that...<br><br>Erin turned around and walked back to the swing. Its ropes were exactly the same type as the one she had been tied up with! There was no way that was just a coincidence. Now she knew why Claudette had a rope when she encountered her in the woods - she was going to use it to fix the swing! Erin looked over at the dirt path.<br><br>Had she had an ounce of common sense, Erin would have just put the swing and the path out of her mind and proceeded directly to the creek. If she had put even the smallest amount of thought into her situation, she'd realize how incredibly stupid it would be for her to take another risk after just barely avoiding complete humiliation. Chances were that she wouldn't be so fortunate the next time!<br><br>But for whatever reason, Erin decided NOT to head directly to the creek. She'd take a short detour first. Knowing that Claudette was somehow associated with the swing, she just HAD to know where that dirt path led! She hadn't completely lost her senses though - once she had ascertained the path's destination, she planned to immediately renew her journey... first to the creek, and then to her clothes.<br><br>But first things first. Still as naked as the day she was born, Erin placed her foot on the path and proceeded forward.<br><br><br>*****<br><br><br>The dirt path meandered its way through the trees. There were fewer willows here and more of other types of trees, like pines and maples. That would have made Erin more vulnerable to exposure, except that the undergrowth was heavier.<br><br>She heard a noise ahead, very faint. She stopped and listened to it carefully. It was the sound of laughter!<br><br>A thought came to mind, both interesting and disturbing. Could it be that...?<br><br>She had to know.<br><br>Slowing her pace, she continued along the path, with the sound gradually getting louder. It was possible she had simply stumbled upon a group of competitors or even spectators of the race, but she didn't think that was the case.<br><br>Going a little farther, her original thought was soon confirmed. She was close enough now to discern that the source of the sound was a small group of girls... and there was no mistaking the sneering undertones present in the one girl's laugh.`,
      3: `If a poll of the neurons floating around in Erin's head had been taken, the results would have shown that a great many of them wanted to vacate the premises immediately. Apparently, however, an even greater number wanted to stay, so again throwing caution to the wind, Erin did exactly that. In fact, not only did she remain there, but she kept moving closer and closer until she was able to see the girls. Sure enough, it was Claudette, Jen, and Shirley.<br><br>The three girls were splashing about in a large in-ground swimming pool situated in the back yard of a house which had been constructed in a clearing, with woods on all sides. In a grassy area on the one side of the pool were a number of large, circular tables, each with chairs distributed evenly around. These were wooden and looked pretty sturdy. There were also some white plastic chairs and chaise lounges lining the far side of the pool.<br><br>Erin spotted some towels draped over three of the plastic chairs. She eyed these enviously. She had been without clothing for quite long enough now; while a towel might not be optimal, it would nevertheless be a considerable improvement. But how could she get one?<br><br>Looking over the various approach routes, she realized her best chance would be to navigate through the woods to get to the closest point to the chairs, then dash out, grab a towel, and dash back in again. Unfortunately the edge of the woods was simply too far away from the chairs. The girls would see her coming, she'd be caught, and then...<br><br>Erin gulped.<br><br>No, she'd have to do without a towel.<br><br>Then she saw Jen get out of the pool, water streaming from her long blond hair. Her hair was not, however, the focus of Erin's attention. Rather, it was on her bathing suit, or, more accurately, the lack thereof. For the skinny girl was completely naked!<br><br>As Erin watched, Jen walked to the deep end of the pool, climbed onto a low diving board, and then reentered the water with a smooth headfirst dive. Shirley took a turn on the diving board next, and then Claudette. Neither of them was wearing a bathing suit either!<br><br>Erin recalled a couple of the things she had been told when the girls had tied her to the tree:<br><br>"Only pervos go outside naked."<br><br>"You're going to get just what you deserve."<br><br>Erin had already developed an intense dislike for the trio, but now her dislike grew to an entirely new level. Her blood began to boil. These same girls who had mocked her, ridiculed her, disparaged her, and had planned to "punish" her for being naked in the woods, were THEMSELVES outside without a stitch on!<br><br>Erin wanted revenge.<br><br>Thoughts of revenge had actually been in the back of her mind much earlier (which may be why she had followed the dirt path once she had associated the broken swing with Claudette) but now those thoughts overwhelmed all others. She HAD to get back at them! But how?<br><br>She stood there thinking hard, but nothing came to mind. As she racked her brain, she noticed that the three had settled down a bit. They had stopped taking turns on the diving board and they were no longer laughing. Rather, they were now just standing in the pool talking. Erin was close enough to pick up most of their conversation.<br><br>At first their conversation was pretty mundane and she was only half paying attention to what they were saying. But then they moved onto another topic which she found a little more interesting: Claudette's aunt.<br><br>From what she could gather, the house and pool belonged to Claudette's aunt, whose name was Lenora, and who was out at the moment. Furthermore, Claudette and her two friends were staying there for the week. From their conversation it sounded like there was something "off" about Aunt Lenora, like she was a bit of a character. No details were mentioned, however, and in any case the information was of no help at all to Erin for her revenge plans.<br><br>Then she heard a little tidbit that made her ears perk up: the girls had left their clothing in the house! That immediately brought to mind the idea of locking them out. But unfortunately they had their towels nearby, so a lockout scenario would at best only be slightly embarrassing - nowhere NEAR what she wanted!<br><br>There was another problem, too: the house was so isolated that no one would see the locked-out girls.<br><br>"If I had a phone," Erin thought, "I could post a message to try to get people to come here. Maybe start a rumor that they're giving away free gold bullion."<br><br>But Erin didn't have a phone, and even if she did, she didn't know the address of this place. Her revenge plans were not going well.<br><br>She decided to shift her focus to the towels. Any plans she came up with would be thwarted by their presence. Her first step had to be to find a way to get those towels away from the girls.<br><br>She thought and thought, but just couldn't come up with a way that wouldn't result in her being caught. It didn't help, either - not in the least - that the girls' conversation shifted to what they had done to her earlier. Their snide comments intermixed with laughter made her so angry she had trouble thinking clearly.<br><br>Getting nowhere, she temporarily gave up on the towels and turned her thoughts toward locking the door. If she could get it locked, that would at least be a start. Yes, she'd try to do that first and then worry about other things after that had been accomplished.<br><br>She studied the door. To get there she'd have to break cover, but once she was near the door she could duck down behind a low wall. It was risky, but it should work; she'd just have to time her dash over there carefully.<br><br>She maneuvered herself as close to the door as possible while still remaining hidden by the trees. Then she watched the girls carefully. When they were all facing away, she made her move.<br><br>Trying to move silently and quickly, she ran toward the door. She'd only be exposed for a few seconds, but if one of the girls happened to turn her head, she'd be toast!<br><br>She focused only on the door, deliberately not even glancing over at the pool. When she got to her destination she crouched low and waited, listening.<br><br>It was a nerve-racking few seconds, with her heart pounding, but she didn't hear any indication that she had been spotted.<br><br>Ok, now for the door. It had an old-style lock with a metal key still sticking in it. Perfect!<br><br>Staying in a crouch, she reached up, turned the key, then pulled it out of the lock. Then she tried to open the door to confirm that it was locked. Yup, it didn't open. The door looked quite solid, too - it wouldn't be an easy one to break into.<br><br>With her mission accomplished, Erin prepared to run back into the woods. She carefully peeked around the low wall and looked over toward the pool. Good - the girls were still all facing away from her. A quick dash and she was safely back in among the trees.<br><br>Erin gave herself a few moments to savor her success, and then returned to her earlier problem.<br><br>"I've GOT to get those towels," she thought. "But how do I keep them from seeing me?"<br><br>Then the beginnings of an idea began to form. "Hey, maybe I could create a diversion!"<br><br>But her plan never had a chance to fully form, for at that moment she heard the sound of a vehicle off in the distance. That in itself would hardly have been noteworthy, but the reactions from the nearby bathers were another story.<br><br>"She's coming!" Claudette said emphatically.<br><br>Apparently her two friends knew the implications of this, for they immediately got out of the pool, grabbed a towel, and began to quickly dry themselves.<br><br>The sound of the vehicle grew in intensity. From its deep rumbling, it was sporting a powerful engine.<br><br>Once they had gotten the bulk of the water off their bodies, the three girls, each carrying a towel, walked quickly toward the door to the house. They were obviously concerned about the approaching vehicle, yet not panicked about it.<br><br>That changed when they reached the door.<br><br>"It's locked!" Shirley, who had reached the door first, said.<br><br>"What!?!" replied Claudette.<br><br>"Where's the key?" Claudette asked, a note of desperation in her voice.<br><br>Claudette and Shirley both turned to Jen.<br><br>"How would I know?" she replied. "Maybe it's on one of the chairs by the pool!"<br><br>"No, it was in the door..." Shirley began, but Claudette had already started running full tilt back to the poolside chairs.<br><br>The vehicle was closer now, the roar of its engine splitting the air.<br><br>"IT'S NOT HERE!!!" Claudette shouted, then sprinted back to the door.<br><br>She shook the door, trying to force it open, but it wouldn't budge.<br><br>"SHIT!" she exclaimed. "She'll be here in a minute!!"<br><br>The girls looked at each other, then, as one, they wrapped their towels around their bodies.<br><br>"Check the windows!" Jen suggested.<br><br>Erin watched all this with growing fascination. Apparently locking the girls out had presented them with some unexpected difficulties. She assumed the approaching vehicle was Claudette's aunt, but didn't understand the source of the girls' panic. Maybe they weren't supposed to be bathing nude, but it shouldn't be THAT big of a deal - after all, they each had a towel around them, and the towels were plenty large enough to protect their modesty.<br><br>They checked a window, then a second one, but both were locked.<br><br>"What about the other door?" Jen asked.<br><br>"But that's always locked!" Claudette replied.<br><br>While Claudette and Shirley checked another window, Jen ran around to the other side of the house. A few moments later she came back.<br><br>"It's locked!" she confirmed.<br><br>Now the engine's sound was so loud it completely drowned out the girls' speech. They ran back to the door and tried repeatedly to force it open.<br><br>While they were doing this the vehicle finally arrived. Coming in fast, it entered an unpaved driveway on the side of the house farthest from the pool. The driver braked hard, and with a cloud of dust the vehicle skidded to a halt.<br><br>It was a large, dark brown pickup truck with oversized all-terrain tires, hefty and powerful-looking. Should the need arise to haul an oversized load of bricks up a 45 degree mountain slope, this looked like the perfect vehicle for the job. It was well used, dirty and littered with numerous dents and scrapes. While in general such signs of damage would not be desirable, on this particular vehicle they looked right at home.<br><br>The truck's door flew open and out stepped the driver, looking every bit as tough as the vehicle she had emerged from.<br><br>Claudette's aunt, assuming that's who she was, was tall - even taller than Claudette - and quite husky. She was wearing a pair of well-worn jeans with a denim top to match. Her hair was dark brown and a bit unkempt, but not outrageously so.<br><br>She approached the house, whistling happily with a light melody completely out of sync with her tough appearance.<br><br>"Hey Aunt Lenora," Claudette called over. There was a noticeable quiver of uncertainty in her voice.<br><br>"Hey girls!" Lenora responded cheerfully, walking toward them.<br><br>Despite her bulk, Aunt Lenora was definitely not fat; she had muscles which looked as hard as granite. In a wrestling match with a fork lift, she'd be a clear favorite.<br><br>"What's up?" Lenora asked, sensing that something was amiss.<br><br>"We're locked out," Claudette said, trying and failing to sound calm and at ease.<br><br>"Oh, that's Ok," Lenora responded smiling broadly. "I've got a key."<br><br>Fishing the key out of the pocket of her jeans, Claudette's aunt reached for the door.<br><br>Just as she was going to put the key in the lock, she stopped.<br><br>With her smile now frozen on her face, Aunt Lenora was looking hard at Shirley.<br><br>Shirley's towel was slightly out of place. A small patch of her thigh was showing, a patch which should have been covered in swimsuit.<br><br>"Where's your bathing suit?" Lenora asked in a stiff voice. Then she looked over at Claudette.<br><br>Aunt Lenora's expectation was for her niece to shift her towel a little to show her that her suspicions were unfounded. Had Claudette done that, the cheerful atmosphere would have returned and all would have been well. But of course Claudette couldn't do that. Claudette's eyes grew wide and her face paled, giving her aunt the answer she didn't want.<br><br>Erin, watching with rapt attention, was starting to understand. In her mind, this just shouldn't have been much of an issue. So what if the girls had been skinny dipping? A little embarrassing, perhaps a little inappropriate, but nothing more. But that was HER view. To Aunt Lenora, it was apparently a major no-no.<br><br>Lenora reached over, and with one smooth, quick motion grabbed Claudette's towel and yanked it off.<br><br>"HEY!" Claudette exclaimed, moving her hands to cover herself.<br><br>Claudette's aunt now had definite confirmation of her suspicions. Without another word, she sat down on the low wall behind which Erin had hidden just moments ago. Then she pulled Claudette across her lap, eliciting a loud gasp from the girl.<br><br>Lenora then began to spank her niece's bare bottom.<br><br>Erin's mouth dropped open in astonishment. Although she could feel that it was open, she didn't close it, judging that the situation was sufficiently bizarre to warrant leaving it just the way it was.<br><br>Smack after smack from Lenora's large hand landed on Claudette's exposed cheeks, eliciting a variety of unhappy sounds from the unfortunate girl. Claudette tried to get up off Lenora's lap, but her aunt easily held her in place.<br><br>Jen and Shirley appeared to be every bit as astonished as Erin. They watched with surprise and dismay as their friend's rear end began to take on a reddish hue. Claudette's face had grown red as well, both from the humiliation of having her friends witnessing her embarrassing punishment and from her considerable displeasure as well.<br><br>As the novelty of the situation began to wear off, Erin finally got around to closing her mouth. She was still, however, finding it hard to believe what she was witnessing; she had never seen anything like it before!<br><br>"Serves her right!" Erin thought to herself.<br><br>Erin was normally a nice enough girl, but Claudette and her two cohorts had gone so far out of bounds that she was actually enjoying what she was seeing. In fact, were the items available, she would have contentedly nestled herself into a comfortable recliner and munched on some hot buttered popcorn while watching the spectacle unfold.<br><br>With Claudette's bottom cheeks blushing redder and redder, Erin glanced over at Jen and Shirley. Both looked very concerned, and were holding their towels tightly around themselves. Erin was pretty sure she knew what was going through each of their minds..... "Will I be next?" Each of them was, after all, the proud owner of their very own soft, smooth bottom, and they did not want that bottom to have the same experience as Claudette's!<br><br>Erin sincerely hoped they both got the same treatment... but there was no hurry. She wanted Claudette to remain over her aunt's lap a bit longer yet. Correction - a LOT longer yet.<br><br>Some rather unladylike words were leaking out of Claudette's mouth; these did not go over well with her aunt, who continued to provide her niece's cheeks with the benefit of her palm at a steady, unwavering pace.<br><br>"I'll bet that smarts!" Erin thought, smirking, as she observed how ridiculously red Claudette's bottom had become. It was positively glowing! She could almost imagine the wavy heat lines and stars emanating from it, like in a cartoon.<br><br>The spanking continued for a while longer, then Lenora finally decided she had gotten her point across. After giving her niece's bare cheeks a couple of final slaps just for good measure, Lenora allowed Claudette to get up off her lap. Claudette looked longingly over at the pool, having a particular interest in its cooling waters. But her aunt stopped her in her tracks with a "don't even think about it" glare.<br><br>Lenora turned to the other two girls, then took a step toward Jen.<br><br>"You're not MY aunt!" Jen squeaked.<br><br>That gave Lenora pause. Some low conversation, too soft for Erin to hear, then ensued. It went back and forth between Jen, Lenora, and Claudette for a little while, until Lenora said something loud enough for Erin to partially pick up:<br><br>"... or I'LL do it!"<br><br>The conversation ended at that point, with Jen and Claudette looking oddly at each other. Shirley, her eyes wide, was looking back and forth between the two.<br><br>"What's that about?" Erin wondered.<br><br>Claudette, still naked, walked over to the low wall and sat down, grunting when her sore bottom made contact with the hard surface. Then Jen, after taking a quick glance over at Claudette's aunt, walked over to her sitting friend.<br><br>Jen and Claudette stared at each other for a moment. Then Claudette reached out and pulled Jen's towel off her! Jen offered no resistance to her friend's action. After tossing the towel aside, Claudette pulled the blond girl across her lap, placed an arm on her lower back to hold her down, and then began to spank her!<br><br>"Whoa!" thought Erin, who hadn't expected this turn of events. One naked girl lying over the lap of another and getting a sound spanking? Well that was... uh...<br><br>Erin was having difficulty finding a suitable adjective. It didn't matter, because she liked what she saw. Both Claudette and Jen's faces were bright red with embarrassment, plus from all the squirming she was doing it was obvious that Jen was not enjoying being on the receiving end of her friend's open palm. Even though this wasn't exactly the type of revenge Erin had been looking for, it was satisfying nonetheless!<br><br>Erin realized that Claudette's aunt must have given the girls a choice - either Claudette give her friend a spanking or she'd do it herself. Not a particularly difficult decision.<br><br>As Claudette spanked the smaller girl, she looked over at her aunt from time to time. Erin assumed she was waiting for some indication that she should stop. But Lenora gave no such indication - she just stood there with her arms folded and a scowl on her face.<br><br>As the skinny blonde's bottom, like her friend's before her, grew redder and redder, Erin saw Shirley take a couple of slow steps backward. Erin realized she was in a difficult position. This had to be the last place on Earth the girl wanted to be, since it was obvious her own backside would be getting the same kind of attention as the other two once Claudette had finished with Jen. But where could she go? She was staying at Lenora's house, and was hardly in a position to walk back to her own place even if it was nearby, which seemed unlikely.<br><br>"Maybe she's going to go hide somewhere for a while," Erin speculated.<br><br>But whatever Shirley had in mind, her plans were quickly squashed. Lenora took a few quick steps over to her, then whispered something in her ear. Erin had no idea what was said but it apparently had the desired effect, for Shirley stopped trying to back away.<br><br>As the fleshy sounds of Claudette's open hand against her friend's bare bottom continued, Erin couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be in a situation like that. What would it feel like to be completely naked and draped over the lap of one of her best friends, who was also naked, and to have that friend spanking her? It would be so incredibly awkward and embarrassing it was hard to even imagine. One thing for sure - it would be a real pain in the ass!<br><br>Erin had no sympathy, however, for any of the three girls. After the way they had treated her they all deserved sore bottoms, and a lot more as well!<br><br>Jen's cheeks were turning cherry red. Erin imagined she could almost feel the heat from them all the way back where she was standing. The contrast of her bottom against the pale skin of her back and legs was so dramatic it almost didn't look real; it looked like she had sat on red paint. Erin was quite sure it felt real enough to Jen, though!<br><br>Satisfied with her niece's work, Lenora instructed Claudette to stop. Jen hopped up off her friend's lap and immediately began to rub her rear end. She did NOT look happy, which pleased Erin to no end.<br><br>"I'll bet those two will have some interesting conversations about all this in the future," Erin thought, a grin flickering across her face.<br><br>Jen reached down for the towel which Claudette had tossed aside, intending to wrap it back around her body, but Lenora grabbed it before she could pick it up. For now, she was going to have to remain naked.<br><br>The focus of attention now switched to the remaining bather, who was standing there nervously, a towel still around her. Prompted by Lenora, she walked slowly over to Claudette. With her face growing red, she removed the towel herself, tossing it to the side. Claudette then guided her over her lap.<br><br>"Here we go again," thought Erin.<br><br>As Claudette began to warm Shirley's cheeks, Erin looked forward to watching their transformation from a light pink, cool and calm, to a vivid red, hot and stinging. That would complete her revenge. After that she'd be on her way.<br><br>But something didn't seem right - she should be feeling a great deal of smug satisfaction at getting back at the girls who had wronged her, but that's simply not how she felt. Even though she was enjoying watching the three get some comeuppance, it just didn't seem like enough.<br><br>It didn't take her long to figure out why: what they had nearly succeeded in doing to her would have been far worse than what they were getting. True, their backsides would be a bit tender for a week or so (that thought brought a smile to her face), plus it was certainly humiliating, but it wasn't nearly as bad as being tied naked to a tree! Had those girls given her the choice of a spanking or total public humiliation, she would have chosen the spanking without a second thought!<br><br>Unfortunately, there wasn't anything she could do about it. She had taken a huge risk locking the girls out - at least she had gotten some unexpected payoff from that. But to try to do something else, especially with Claudette's huge aunt there, would be insane.<br><br>Her focus returned to the scene unfolding before her. Shirley's bottom was getting red, but it wasn't nearly as red as her two friends'. Her spanking had quite a way to go yet... at least Erin hoped it did!<br><br>Erin took in all the sights and sounds: Shirley's bottom, completely exposed and positioned perfectly to receive Claudette's open palm. The rhythmic sound of the slaps - fairly loud and oddly compelling. The way Shirley's cheeks were flattened just for a moment after each impact.<br><br>There were other details too, things Erin couldn't help but notice: Claudette's arm on her friend's waist, holding her in place. The small grunts Shirley was making as she was spanked. The little wiggles of her bottom as it unsuccessfully tried to evade its punishment. The bare flesh of the two naked girls pressed tightly together. The proximity of their private areas...<br><br>It was all just so weird!<br><br>So..... warped!<br><br>So..... twisted!<br><br>So..... so..... erotic!<br><br>"Yeeps, no! Not that! Definitely not that!!!"<br><br>Erin studiously ignored the heat which had suddenly invaded her face.<br><br>As her unknown spectator looked on, Claudette continued her work; she appeared to be holding nothing back. She was alternating between Shirley's cheeks, giving the one a healthy smack, then the other, then back to the first, over and over again, ensuring that each got equal treatment. Wouldn't do to play favorites!<br><br>Shirley's posterior was flaming red now. Erin glanced behind her, gauging her retreat route in anticipation of the end of the festivities. No problems there, she'd just need to walk quietly until she was out of hearing range.<br><br>As Erin had expected, a few moments later Lenora told Claudette she could stop. Shirley quickly got off her lap, then turned and glared at her. Claudette pointed over to her aunt as if to say "Would you rather I had let HER do it?"<br><br>Shirley appeared to get the point. She looked away from Claudette, then scanned the ground for the towel she had tossed aside earlier. It wasn't there, however, for Lenora had already picked it up.<br><br>"May I have my towel back?" Shirley asked grouchily.<br><br>Lenora didn't answer her. Instead, like a mother bear herding her cubs, she guided the three still-naked girls over toward the pool.<br><br>"What's this?" Erin wondered. She had assumed that once Shirley's spanking had ended, they'd go back into the house and get dressed. But something else was going on. She put her leaving plans on hold for the moment.<br><br>She watched, fascinated, as the huge aunt lined the three girls up side by side facing the pool. She positioned Jen on the left, Claudette in the middle, and Shirley on the right.<br><br>"Put your hands on your heads," Lenora instructed the girls in a commanding voice.<br><br>None of them obeyed - they just looked quizzically over at her.<br><br>"NOW!!!" Lenora demanded, her voice like an erupting volcano.<br><br>In two seconds flat, all three girls had their hands on their heads, their fingers interlocked and their elbows pointing out to the sides.<br><br>"Now you STAY like that for an hour. I'll let you know when your time is up."<br><br>So in addition to their spankings, the girls were being put into timeout. Lenora had made them stand in the grassy area facing the pool, since that was where their inappropriate behavior had taken place. They'd have to remain there for an hour, their blazing bottoms a reminder not to repeat their offense.<br><br>"Good," thought Erin. The girls obviously wouldn't like having to stand there like that, and anything they didn't like, she DID!<br><br>"What time is it?" Claudette asked her aunt. There was concern in her voice.<br><br>That seemed an odd question under the circumstances. Why did the current time matter? In any case, Erin, too, was curious about the time, so she listened carefully for Lenora's response.<br><br>"Be quiet," Lenora responded, in a softer tone than before. Her voice was more instructional than commanding. "No talking until your hour is up."<br><br>Lenora followed this up with an answer to Claudette's question: "It's 1:30."<br><br>"But your party starts at 3:00!" Claudette said, her concern starting to sound more like panic.<br><br>"I thought I told you to..." Lenora started, annoyed.<br><br>"But what if someone comes early?" Claudette persisted.<br><br>The reason for her concern was now crystal clear.<br><br>"Be SILENT! Not another word!" Lenora was growing angry. "I doubt if anyone will come that early, but if they do, that's YOUR problem. You should have thought about that before engaging in that type of behavior."<br><br>Lenora stormed away and entered her house, leaving Claudette, Jen, and Shirley wide-eyed and speechless.<br><br>*****<br><br>"If only... if only..."<br><br>The thought was going through Erin's mind over and over again. If only she had a phone and Lenora's guest list! Then she'd call everyone and tell them the party had been rescheduled - that they should come right away!<br><br>It was just wishful thinking, but WHAT a wish! Oh well, not going to happen.<br><br>Erin really needed to be on her way now. She still had a long walk ahead of her, and she still didn't have a stitch of clothing. It was too bad that Claudette's aunt had taken the towels into the house with her.<br><br>But she didn't leave just yet, for, despite Lenora's instructions, the girls were talking quietly among themselves. Pretty brazen, Erin thought, for Lenora was NOT someone she would want to piss off!<br><br>She had to listen carefully to hear what they were saying, but she was able to pick up most of it. They were all obviously concerned about the upcoming party, and what they would do if someone DID come early!<br><br>"My aunt's normally very nice," Claudette explained. "Unfortunately, she's a little weird about some stuff."<br><br>"Yeah, like nude bathing," Erin thought to herself.<br><br>"And you DON'T want to cross her!" Claudette added.<br><br>"But we can't stay here like this if someone comes!!!!!" Jen pointed out.<br><br>"SHHHhhhhh! Keep your voice down!"<br><br>"But..." Jen started, more softly this time.<br><br>"Yeah, I know, I know," Claudette said, "but we don't have a choice. I don't know what she'll do if we move, and I DO NOT want to find out! We'll just have to hope no one comes early!"<br><br>"But..."<br><br>"How many people are coming?" Shirley asked, interrupting Jen.<br><br>"Around 70."<br><br>"Oh FUCK!"<br><br>"Relax," said Claudette. "We'll be gone before they get here. No one's going to come a half hour early."<br><br>They stopped talking after that, their minds all on the same thing. They were hoping - really, REALLY hoping - that that last statement was correct.<br><br>*****<br><br>Erin briefly considered waiting there to see if any of the party guests arrived early, but she didn't want to hang around that long. Anyway she agreed with what Claudette had told her friends - that it was very unlikely any of the guests would get there that much ahead of the party's starting time.<br><br>Before she left, she took one last look at the girls in timeout. She was seeing them from the back, so she had a perfect view of their glowing red bottoms - three pairs of well-roasted buns right in a row. It looked like Claudette had gotten it the worst, but not by much. This was not a sight she had expected to see when she had started out on her journey today!<br><br>She wondered how people would react if they saw the girls like that. She imagined some gasping and covering their mouths. Some would just stare, shocked looks on their faces. She imagined others pointing and giggling.<br><br>There was something about her mental image of people pointing and giggling at the naked girls that tickled her funny bone. It was funny enough to her, in fact, to make her laugh.<br><br>Laughing, however, would not be at all convenient at the moment.<br><br>She tried to forcibly suppress the laughter which threatened to emerge. This was made difficult because it had come upon her so quickly, with no forewarning. Her efforts were partially successful - she was able to hold most of her laughter inside.<br><br>But not all of it.<br><br>Some of it escaped in the form of a snort - a loud one.<br><br>Making that noise was bad enough, but the situation was actually even worse. When Erin had been scrutinizing the girls, she had unconsciously moved a little closer so she could see them better. Although she was still in among the trees, she was now partially visible. In particular, her face was completely exposed.<br><br>Hearing the snort, Claudette whipped herself around, with Jen and Shirley following suit. Erin's and Claudette's eyes met... and locked. Time stood still, with the two staring girls frozen in place.<br><br>The spell was broken when recognition flashed across Claudette's face.<br><br>"It's HER!" She yelled. "GET HER!!!"<br><br>Erin turned and ran.<br><br>A moment later she heard the sound of pursuit. She only had a small lead! If they caught her...<br><br>She ran like the wind, putting her entire being into the effort.<br><br>"GET BACK HERE!!!"<br><br>Lenora's voice was so powerful and compelling that Erin actually slowed down for a moment. Just for a moment though - she recovered quickly and accelerated back up to full speed.<br><br>She didn't hear anything behind her, but she continued her flat-out pace anyway until she started feeling out of breath. Then she stopped and hid as best she could behind a bush. Then she listened.<br><br>She heard voices off in the distance; it sounded like an argument.<br><br>She actually hadn't run very far; the pace she had been travelling had tired her out quickly. Even so, she was too far from the source of the sound to make out what was being said.<br><br>Ignoring her common sense once again, she began to walk slowly back the way she came. She moved as quietly as she could, ready to stop and hide at the first hint of trouble.<br><br>As she moved closer, she could hear Lenora, who was speaking in a raised voice.<br><br>"A naked girl. In the woods. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Stop your LYING!"<br><br>Erin smiled when she heard that. Claudette and her two friends had obviously tried to tell Lenora about her, but she didn't believe them! Knowing she wasn't being pursued, she walked a little faster.<br><br>Soon she was able to pick up the entire conversation. The three girls kept insisting that they had encountered a naked girl in the woods and that they had just seen that same girl near the house. Lenora continued to not believe them. Then it got even more interesting.<br><br>"But we're telling you the TRUTH!" Claudette insisted.<br><br>"Yeah, we tied her to a tree," Jen said.<br><br>"You WHAT?????" Lenora sounded shocked.<br><br>"Shut up, you idiot," Claudette muttered to her not-very-bright friend.<br><br>"Well, uh..." Jen sputtered, realizing she shouldn't have mentioned that last tidbit.<br><br>But she couldn't undo what she had just said. Haltingly, she tried to continue. "Like Claudette said, there was this naked girl in the woods. We, uh.... well, there was a tree there, so, uh...."<br><br>"You tied a girl to a tree," Lenora clarified. "A naked girl. A naked girl you just happened to come across in the woods."<br><br>"Well, uh..."<br><br>"You're lucky I don't believe a word you're saying," Lenora said.<br><br>"You're right. I was lying," Jen said, seeing a way out. "There was no naked girl."<br><br>"JEN!" Claudette said angrily.<br><br>"So not only were you swimming without a bathing suit," Lenora said, her tone sounding like that was one of the worst crimes imaginable, "but now you're lying too. A naked girl in the woods. You three could at least have come up with a half believable story."<br><br>Claudette, in a bind now, gave up trying to argue. If she somehow was able to convince her aunt that there really WAS a naked girl traipsing around in the woods, then Lenora might realize that Jen had been telling the truth about tying her up. That wouldn't end well.<br><br>"Get back into position right now," Lenora instructed. She sounded very annoyed.<br><br>Erin was almost close enough now to see them. Just a little further.<br><br>"Hands on your heads," Lenora commanded.<br><br>Moments later, she added, "Now you STAY there. ALL of you. Don't even THINK about moving!"<br><br>Lenora walked away, in the direction of her house.<br><br>There - now Erin could just make out the girls. As expected, they were back in their original position: standing side-by-side facing the pool, their feet together and their hands on their heads. She could hear a whispered argument, mainly involving Claudette and Jen, going back and forth.<br><br>She edged a little closer, being careful this time to remain hidden within the woods. Now she had a better view of them. She was pleased to see that their bottoms were just as red now as when they had first been spanked.<br><br>But for all the ruckus she had caused with her stifled laugh, nothing appeared to have changed. It had made Claudette's aunt angry, but not enough to make things worse for the girls. Too bad.<br><br>"She should have punished them for lying," thought Erin, not stopping to think that they had actually been telling the truth.<br><br>If only Lenora knew that her niece and two friends had tied her naked to a tree! Then they'd REALLY be in trouble! She remembered what Lenora had said on the subject: "You're lucky I don't believe a word you're saying."<br><br>"I could always tell Claudette's aunt what they did," Erin thought.<br><br>A split second later she chided herself: "Oh yes, Erin, what a clever idea."<br><br>She sarcastically imagined the actions she would take. She'd exit the woods, walk stark naked up to Lenora and say: "Excuse me, ma'am. They were telling the truth. I really WAS walking around naked in the woods. I was also spying on your niece and her two friends while they were swimming in the nude."<br><br>At a minimum, she wouldn't be sitting comfortably for quite some time.<br><br>Then Erin saw Lenora approaching from the house, carrying something. She stood in front of the three girls and showed them what she had: some rope. Then she walked behind them and tossed it to the ground. It landed a few feet behind Claudette. Erin could see that there were several pieces of rope there; it was the same type of rope she had been tied up with.<br><br>"O..... k....." Erin thought.<br><br>Her hands now empty, Lenora walked back to face the girls.<br><br>"Listen carefully," she said. Her voice wasn't loud, but there was power behind her words. "I've had enough of you three. You've made me very angry. You have 40 minutes left of your timeout. For that time you'd BETTER stand there, in exactly the position you're in. Do NOT take your hands off your heads. Do NOT speak... and that includes whispering."<br><br>Now she was glaring at them.<br><br>"If there's ANY more nonsense from ANY of you, I don't care WHAT the reason, you'll all regret it. A lot."<br><br>Lenora had Erin's full, undivided attention, and Erin was sure the same was true of the three who had incurred her wrath.<br><br>"Yipes!" thought Erin. "If I was on the receiving end of THAT speech, I'd be damned sure to do exactly what she said!"<br><br>"I'm going to work outside for a while," Lenora said in a calmer voice. "I'll let you know when your time is up."<br><br>Lenora walked back to her house and began working on a flower bed situated near the doorway.<br><br>*****<br><br>Erin continued watching Claudette, Jen, and Shirley. They were all as still as statues; she wished she could see their faces! Clearly Lenora's warning speech had made an impression.<br><br>But what now?<br><br>Erin was still angry with them, but it seemed like things were winding down. She had no doubt they'd remain standing there for the next 40 minutes, after which their punishment would be over.<br><br>"I wish I could get them in more trouble," she thought.<br><br>But she didn't see how. She briefly considered the idea of calling out to them from the woods (being careful so that only they, and not Lenora, could hear her), but she figured they'd simply ignore her. They wouldn't be stupid enough to let her goad them into a reaction.<br><br>She scanned the area, hoping an idea would come to mind. First she looked over at Lenora, who was on her knees pulling some weeds out, then she slowly brought her view back over to the girls. Nothing.<br><br>Her eyes lit upon the ropes sitting on the grass a few feet behind Claudette.<br><br><ding><br><br>An idea came to mind, one she almost discarded immediately as being too stupid to even consider.<br><br>But she couldn't just forget about it because she couldn't come up with a clear-cut reason why it would definitely fail. True, it would be risky - almost insanely so. Still...<br><br>She thought about it some more. It might actually work.<br><br>"But it would be too mean!"<br><br>Then she recalled how the girls were laughing about what they had done to her when they were in the pool.<br><br>She decided her actions would be justified.<br><br>There was one big problem, though: Claudette's aunt. She was too close by. If Erin tried anything, she'd turn around, and that would be that. Under other circumstances Erin might have gambled that she could outrun the woman, but she had already expended a fair amount of energy today and thus wasn't at her full running strength. Even if she was, she did not like the idea of having that huge woman barreling toward her. No, she didn't like that idea at all.<br><br>For the next few minutes Erin tried to think of some other plan. Unfortunately, her mind was stuck on the one she had already come up with. No matter how hard she tried, her thoughts kept circling back to it.<br><br>This was going nowhere, and Erin once more began to think about just leaving. Her thirst for "balancing the books" would have to go unquenched.<br><br>Then Lenora stood up. She walked around the side of the house and disappeared behind it.<br><br>Erin realized this might be her one and only chance. There was no time to think! She put her plan into action.<br><br>She broke cover and silently crept toward the girls.<br><br>It was essential that they didn't hear her coming. If any of them would happen to turn around, or if Lenora reappeared from behind her house, it was all over.<br><br>Step after step. Closer and closer.<br><br>Erin reached the ropes. Claudette was only about eight feet in front of her.<br><br>She was laser-focused on her task. She didn't even look over to see if Lenora was coming. She had to be silent - oh, so silent. Quiet breathing. Moving slowly to avoid creating air currents that Claudette would detect.<br><br>Erin picked up one of the ropes. So far, so good.<br><br>She got the rope into position.<br><br>It was time to make some noise.<br><br>Erin snapped the rope, throwing her arm out and quickly pulling it back.<br><br><THWAPPP!!!><br><br>Bullseye!<br><br>The end of the rope, moving at an impressive clip, struck Claudette's bottom. Her sore, very red bottom.<br><br>"***** YEEEEOOUCHHH!!!!! *****"<br><br>Claudette let out an impressive yell.<br><br>Erin didn't wait. By the time the sound was leaving Claudette's lips, she had already dropped the rope back onto the pile of others. As the echoes of Claudette's displeasure began to fade, Erin had already turned back toward the woods. She was already running full speed toward them when Claudette's hands reached the surface of her posterior.<br><br>Erin had correctly deduced that Claudette would not immediately give chase. She was too busy rubbing her bottom in an attempt to soothe the intense sting that had just greeted it. Erin didn't run far into the woods, just far enough to be out of sight. Wisely or not, she wanted to watch the events unfold that she had just set into motion.<br><br>Lenora came back into view, approaching like a charging bull. Actually Erin had never SEEN a charging bull, but if she had, she was sure this was what it would look like.<br><br>Moments later Lenora arrived, her face red with anger.<br><br>"What the HELL..." she began.<br><br>Claudette, in quite a state, blurted out the reason for her disruption.<br><br>"She HIT me! She HIT me!"<br><br>"WHO hit you?" Lenora demanded. Erin couldn't recall ever hearing such aggravation in a voice.<br><br>"That GIRL!!!"<br><br>Through clenched teeth, Claudette's aunt asked, "What girl?"<br><br>"The girl that... the one that..." Claudette began, realizing she had just brought up a subject that her aunt already didn't believe, and that had made her very angry just a short time ago.<br><br>"The naked girl?" Lenora prompted. "The one in the woods?"<br><br>Erin could almost hear the "Oh shit" travelling through Claudette's mind.<br><br>"But she HIT me!" Claudette insisted, declining to directly answer her aunt's question.<br><br>"Where did she hit you?"<br><br>Lenora's voice was flat and soft. Erin could hear the pressure building, like tectonic plates pressing against each other. A little more and there'd be an earthquake.<br><br>"On my... right HERE!" Claudette said, pointing indignantly to the spot where the rope had impacted.<br><br>Lenora inspected the troubled area.<br><br>"I don't see a mark."<br><br>Erin had also correctly deduced that the rope's impact wouldn't be detectable - not with Claudette's cheeks already being so red!<br><br>Claudette was so angry she wasn't thinking clearly.<br><br>"She DID hit me!!"<br><br>"The naked girl in the woods?" Lenora prompted again.<br><br>"YES, DAMN IT!"<br><br>"The one who doesn't exist?"<br><br>"SHE DOES TOO FUCKING EXIST! SHE WAS RIGHT HERE! SHE HIT ME!"<br><br>"Oh dear," Erin thought.<br><br>"***** ENOUGH!!! *****" The earthquake had arrived.<br><br>"I WARNED YOU!!!"<br><br>Claudette stopped arguing; she knew she had gone overboard, and it was obvious that any further discussion was futile and would only make things worse. She was furious that she had allowed the girl they had tied up to goad her into a blow-up with her aunt. It made her even angrier knowing that it had to have been that same girl who had locked them out of the house!<br><br>With Claudette seething and her two friends frozen in place by her aunt's anger, Lenora sprang into action. She grabbed the four pieces of rope that were lying on the ground. After ushering Claudette back into position between Jen and Shirley (who had never left their spots), she began to use the ropes.<br><br>Viewed from the back the girls were positioned with Jen on the left, then Claudette, and then Shirley on the right. Lenora tied Jen's right ankle to Claudette's left one. Then she tied Claudette's right ankle to Shirley's left one. That left her with two pieces of rope.<br><br>Erin was watching intently. She wondered how Lenora would finish the job with only two ropes. Would she tie the girls' wrists together in the same way she had tied their ankles?<br><br>But that wasn't what Lenora had in mind. She tied the one end of the third rope to Shirley's right ankle, and then attached the other end to a tree just off to Shirley's right. Then she walked back over to Jen to complete her job with the one remaining rope. She tied the one end of the rope to Jen's left ankle, then began walking toward a pole embedded in the ground off to Jen's left. But then she encountered a problem.<br><br>"Oh," Lenora said. "This rope is too short."<br><br>The rope she had attached to Jen's left ankle wouldn't reach the pole. She hesitated for a few moments, but then saw a simple solution to her difficulties.<br><br>She slowly pulled the end of the rope toward the pole.<br><br>That had an interesting effect. As Lenora pulled the rope, the girls' stances began to widen. They had started out with their legs tightly together, but by the time Lenora had pulled the rope to the pole and tied it fast, their legs were all spread wide.<br><br>Erin was surprised and amused. The girls' legs weren't spread so far that it made it hard for them to stand, but they were plenty wide enough to make the view quite interesting. She could hear quiet gasps coming from the girls' direction.<br><br>"Aunt Lenora..." Claudette began, speaking softly.<br><br>"Shush," her aunt replied, her voice sounding much calmer now that she had completed her work. "You only have yourselves to blame."<br><br>Lenora continued: "It's 2:05 now. That means you have 25 minutes remaining in your timeout."<br><br>"That's it?" Erin thought. She was disappointed. An odd reaction perhaps, but she had hoped to get more results from her efforts. After all, she had just taken a huge risk. True, having to stand there like that for nearly half an hour had to be pretty embarrassing, but all things considered it really just wasn't that big of a deal.<br><br>Well, she'd just have to be satisfied with the spankings and the humiliating timeout. She had to admit, those spankings were not something that would soon be forgotten... neither by her nor by those who had been on the receiving end. She certainly wasn't going to try to do anything else. Enough risks for the day - it was time for her to leave.<br><br>Erin turned around, then began her journey to retrieve her clothes.<br><br>*****<br><br>Erin had only taken a few steps when she heard Lenora say something else:<br><br>"When that timeout is over you'll have a second timeout. That's your punishment for repeatedly disobeying my explicit instructions. Your second timeout will last for two hours."<br><br>Erin came to a halt.<br><br>"Did she just say...?"<br><br>For several seconds, only the sounds of the forest could be heard.<br><br>Then chaos.<br><br>"... but..."<br><br>"...the PARTY..."<br><br>"... we can't..."<br><br>"... we're NAKED!"<br><br>All three girls were talking at once, loudly, making it impossible to discern anything other than fragments of what they were saying. This went on for a little while, with Lenora not responding.<br><br>Eventually the girls' clamoring subsided, and then she spoke.<br><br>"Please be quiet and let me explain further."<br><br>Silence reigned once more; Lenora's next words would be important to all who were listening.<br><br>Erin told herself, "There's no way she'd do that to her own niece. She'll probably have them serve their second timeout in the house."<br><br>But just underneath those thoughts she was thinking something else:<br><br>"Please... please... please..."<br><br>Lenora began her speech:<br><br>"I get the feeling that you're concerned about my upcoming party. I'll address those concerns in a moment."<br><br>"But first, let me clarify some ground rules for your timeouts - both of them. First of all, no talking - that means no talking to me, no talking among yourselves, no whispering... well, you get the idea. I've been too lax with you on that rule, but no more."<br><br>"Secondly. You may NOT take your hands off your head, not for ANY reason."<br><br>"I hope I've made those rules clear - during your timeouts, you keep your mouths shut and stay exactly in the position you're in now. Nod if you understand me."<br><br>All three girls' heads nodded up and down. Erin had to catch herself to keep her head from doing the same thing.<br><br>"If you violate EITHER of those rules, then... well, let's hold on that until I've explained about the party."<br><br>"I can certainly understand your concerns. Since you're going to have to serve your timeouts facing the pool, right where you are now, the obvious way to address those concerns is to cancel the party."<br><br>"NOOOOOoooooo," thought Erin.<br><br>"The thing is, I can see no justification for penalizing my guests just because the three of you decided to be so naughty."<br><br>Claudette's mouth opened. Erin couldn't see it from her viewpoint, but Lenora could. She gave her niece a look that would uncurdle cottage cheese. Claudette's mouth closed again.<br><br>"Holy shit!" Erin thought. "She's really going to do it? She's crazy! Crazy, but likeable, heh heh heh."<br><br>"Now if you follow the rules, I'll release you at 4:30. That's only 90 minutes after my party has started. That shouldn't be too bad."<br><br>"Yup, certifiable," thought Erin, grinning.<br><br>"On the other hand, if any of you break my rules, even just once..."<br><br>There was a dramatic pause.<br><br>"... then I'll make your second timeout FOUR hours long, instead of just two!"<br><br>"Oh... my... God!!!" Erin thought. This was too good to be true.<br><br>"I'm going back to my flower beds. Now be good."<br><br>Having delivered her bombshell, Lenora walked away.`,
      4: `Erin, still positioned behind the girls, scrutinized them again. It was bad enough that their legs were spread wide, but to have their glowing red bottoms exposed for all to see? For an hour and a half? It was hard to even comprehend. The humiliation would be right off the scale.<br><br>Erin worked her way through the woods so she could see the girls from the front. She focused on their tied ankles, then slowly raised her view. First their smooth legs, themselves real attention getters. Then the place where those legs met. The view was breathtakingly lewd and equally sexy - sure to be a focal point for the party crowd. Next, the soft, pale skin of their bellies. Then their breasts, firm and jutting outward with authority. Apparently there was enough of a breeze to stimulate them, for their nipples were pointing vigorously, seemingly desperate to call people's attention to something off in the distance. Erin wished them luck with that.<br><br>Then she looked at their faces: a mixture of shock, dismay, and disbelief. None of them were talking, not even softly. Their eyes, desperation evident in them, darted around, sometimes looking over at their neighbors, sometimes looking down at their own bodies, and other times scanning the area to see if anyone was approaching.<br><br>They all looked as nervous as balloons in a pin factory.<br><br>"Lenora should have tied their hands, too," Erin thought, unsympathetically.<br><br>Then she corrected herself. Having their hands free would be even worse! If they were tied, then they'd have no choice in the matter - covering themselves would not be possible. But with them untied, they'd have to deliberately allow everyone to see them and all their secrets. They'd have to force their hands to remain on their heads while reams of interested onlookers scrutinized their naked bodies.<br><br>Erin shook her head. "That would be impossible," she thought. "There's no way I'd be able to do that."<br><br>On the other hand, if she was in their situation perhaps she'd be thinking differently.<br><br>It was something she had no interest in putting to the test.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Erin watched them for a full ten minutes, then went back to her original position and viewed them from the back for a few minutes more. She really wanted to stay there until the party guests arrived. She wanted to see their reactions: their red faces, their bodies squirming under their spectators' gazes, their struggles to keep their hands on their heads...<br><br>She wanted to see it all!<br><br>"That'll be so HOT," she thought.<br><br>"But only because they're so mean!" she quickly appended.<br><br>She wouldn't have to wait that long for the guests to begin to arrive, but would it be wise for her to stay there? It would certainly be risky, for it was entirely possible - likely even - that some of the guests would enter the woods around the house.<br><br>She consulted her neurons. They had already had a busy day, being called upon to make numerous decisions, and now they needed to make another.<br><br>Unlike some of their earlier decisions, this one was a landslide. They recommended overwhelmingly that she leave. Although neurons can't speak, the message they conveyed to Erin was basically:<br><br>"Wait for the guests? Are you out of your MIND? Idiot! Get out of there! Now!"<br><br>A bit rude perhaps, but they wanted to get their point across.<br><br>Erin sighed, taking one last look - a good, long one - at the girls.<br><br>Then she smiled. She had gotten her revenge. The books had been balanced, and with interest. A LOT of it! Her part in this little episode was now at an end. But her adversaries? Their part was only just beginning.<br><br>Her smile broadened as she slowly walked away.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Once she got to the broken swing, Erin cut through the woods in the direction she estimated would bring her to the creek the fastest. Navigation was easy, for the clouds had not returned.<br><br>Her mind was swirling with all the things that had happened, but as she walked she gradually began to settle down and some of the joy she had felt earlier returned. It really did feel good to walk naked among the trees.<br><br>Now, though, she just wanted to get her clothes. She had had more than enough adventure for one day!<br><br>Incredibly, considering all she had been through and all the risks she had taken, she had made it through the day virtually unscathed. The only actual humiliation she had endured had been when the three girls caught her. After they left her tied to the tree, no one else had gotten even a glimpse of her.<br><br>She came upon a log from a maple tree which had fallen some time past. It had wildflowers growing all around it - yellow, red, and pink. She hadn't seen this in any of her previous walks - it was beautiful. She sat on the log for a brief rest.<br><br>The hard wood pressing against her bottom felt odd, yet pleasant. She could smell the aroma from the flowers and could see a few bees buzzing around. They weren't a concern, as their interest lay only in the flowers' pollen and nectar, not the naked girl nearby.<br><br>She rested there for about five minutes, then stood up. A thought crossed her mind: "Oh crap, I hope I didn't get any splinters."<br><br>A quick check reassured her that her concerns were unfounded.<br><br>She took another direction check from the sun, then proceeded. Before long, she came to a clearing - a large circular area surrounded by the forest.<br><br>This was familiar ground; she knew exactly where she was. Although she couldn't see it, she knew the creek was just on the other side of the open area.<br><br>She didn't enter the clearing. Although she didn't see anyone, she'd be far too exposed. Instead, she began to work her way around its periphery.<br><br>She had only gone a short distance when she heard a rustling sound. She froze. Was it an animal? If so, it sounded big. That wasn't good.<br><br>The sound had come from somewhere in front of her. Not super close, but not that far off either. Up until now she had been navigating around the clearing in a clockwise manner. She changed directions and quietly walked back the other way.<br><br>She heard the rustling again, but this time it was behind her and a little farther away. That was better. But after a few more steps a similar noise came from the direction she was now heading. Once again, she froze, her mind automatically speculating on the source.<br><br>Could it be the girls? No, they were occupied. Sheep? No, that was absurd. Bears? No, of course not. Well... probably not. Well... hopefully not.<br><br>Erin swallowed.<br><br>Then she heard someone talking.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Erin didn't know what to do. She was hidden within a willow tree on the border of the clearing, but her hiding place was far from perfect.<br><br>She was hearing more and more rustling and talking from scattered locations around her. Not only were the sounds coming in from both sides, but she was hearing some from behind her as well, making retreat a huge risk. She didn't hear anything coming from the clearing in front of her but she certainly didn't want to move out into the open!<br><br>The trouble was, she couldn't just stay there. There were obviously a fair number of people moving around nearby. It was only a matter of time before one of them would spot her!<br><br>She got as close to the leaves separating her from the clearing as she dared. Even though the clearing wasn't a good option, she was thinking that maybe she could dart across a portion of it to get to a better position - a place farther from all the people milling around. Looking through a gap in the leaves, she scanned the area. There was no one out there.<br><br>As she watched the clearing, even more people were making themselves heard. There were both male and female voices; they sounded young, maybe about her age. She self-consciously scrunched herself down into a crouch.<br><br>Someone entered the clearing from a point just to her left. Still as a statue, she held her breath. The individual - it was a young man - walked directly by her! He was just on the other side of the leaves, only a few feet away! She wanted to back away, but didn't dare move.<br><br>The young man turned to face the clearing, his arms folded over his chest. This allowed her to see the back of his shirt. It was emblazoned with the outline of a large pine tree within which were the letters 'EMHC.'<br><br>"You've got to be kidding me," thought Erin, for she was familiar with this particular abbreviation: East Mountain Hiking Club. They were associated with a college located about 50 miles away.<br><br>This couldn't be happening. What were the odds of them picking this particular day, time, and location for a hike? And why were they converging here, near the clearing. Were they going to camp?<br><br>But the reason for their presence was really of no concern. All that mattered was that they WERE here... and so was she!<br><br>The hiker turned and continued walking past her until he reentered the woods.<br><br>Well, at least that was one hiker out of the way, but what about all the others? She had to get out of there!<br><br>She once again considered trying to retreat through the woods; risky or not, that seemed her best option. But just as she was about to stand up, she heard more rustling sounds from behind her.<br><br>To make matters even worse, she saw a small group of hikers entering the clearing from the left, and shortly thereafter from the right as well. So much for cutting across the clearing!<br><br>Off to the right she heard a girl laughing loudly - it was shrill and piercing. For a moment she thought the girl had spotted her, but the sound had come from too far away. "What's SHE up to?" Erin couldn't help but wonder, cringing at the grating sound.<br><br>As she continued watching, more and more hikers were entering the clearing, from both sides. It seemed to Erin that the clearing might be the gathering point for the entire group. If that was the case, then staying put might be her best choice after all. She could simply wait until they were all out there, and then she could continue on to the creek, giving the clearing a wide berth.<br><br>"Uh..... ma'am?"<br><br>The young man's hesitant voice had come from directly behind her! He sounded like he was close enough to touch her!<br><br>A girl's giggle punctuated the young man's query. It, too, had come from directly behind.<br><br>Thoughts went through Erin's mind like lightning.<br><br>"There's a pair of hikers standing right behind me."<br><br>"They're looking right at me."<br><br>"I'm not wearing anything at all."<br><br>Acting on reflex, Erin jumped up out of her crouch. Then she began to run forward... right into the clearing.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>It only took Erin a moment to realize she was out in the open, for it had suddenly become much brighter. She stopped running and froze, conflicted between her need to get away from the pair who had caught her and her overwhelming desire to get back under cover in the trees. Her inactivity was short-lived, however, for standing there fully exposed was even worse than her other choices. Off in the distance she could see the other side of the clearing; it was devoid of people. Bringing all her engines up to full power, she sprinted in that direction.<br><br>She glanced over to her left. That was a mistake, for she could see the hikers gawking at her... every last one of them. That made her feel more naked and exposed than she had ever felt in her life. She quickly turned her head away and tried to focus on her eventual destination, but afterimages of the hikers remained in her mind - their assortment of smiles and expressions of shock.<br><br>Then she began to hear shouts... whistles... cheers... catcalls. From the right, she heard a young woman loudly exclaim, "Look how RED her face is!" She hadn't realized it before but now she could feel the burning heat in her cheeks and forehead. Even her neck was hot!<br><br>She could feel the eyes on her, their gaping stares pressing against her bare skin. Every square inch of her body was under close examination. She wanted to run even faster, but couldn't - she was already maxed out. The other end of the clearing seemed so far away. There was no quick exit for her!<br><br>She tried not to think about the show she was putting on: her jiggling breasts... her wriggling hips... her legs continually separating, coming together, and separating again with every stride. How this must look to everyone who was watching her!<br><br>Rising above the spectators' clamoring, a shouted marriage proposal came sailing in from an enthusiastic admirer. Her face, having already gone through 20 shades of red, now took on number 21. With each step she was learning new meanings for the word "embarrassment."<br><br>The end of her humiliation was in sight though, for the far end of the clearing was gradually getting nearer. If she just kept up her pace, she'd soon reach the welcoming willows standing there.<br><br>But now there was another problem - she was getting tired. She had put too many demands on her body earlier, and it was catching up to her... fast.<br><br>Erin was an experienced enough runner to realize that there was no way she'd be able to maintain her pace all the way to the end of the clearing. No amount of motivation was going to change that. She had to do something or else face the prospect of having to stop, doubled over with her hands on her knees and gasping for breath. Not a desirable outcome even in the best of circumstances, and these were far from the best of circumstances.<br><br>What she did next was one of the hardest things she had ever done in her life: she slowed down.<br><br>Physically, that helped a lot; she could feel her breathing coming back under control. But now she was giving her audience more time to view her! Would they think she had slowed down for exactly that purpose? Did they think she enjoyed letting them see her without a stitch of clothing on?<br><br>As humiliating as that idea was, she couldn't help what they thought. She had slowed down by necessity, not choice! There was, of course, no way she could relay that information to her hiker "friends."<br><br>"Steady... steady..." Erin told herself as her legs, seemingly of their own volition, tried to pick up the pace.<br><br>She just needed to hold it together for a little while longer. She continued staring straight ahead toward the edge of the clearing. As long as no hikers emerged from that point, she'd soon be out of this!<br><br>But suppose some people DID come out of the woods? What would she do then? She could hardly continue running right toward them! Yet she didn't have nearly enough stamina left for a major course change, and even if she did, where exactly would she go? Hikers had been steaming in from the left, the right, and behind her - that's why she was going in this direction!<br><br>No, if more hikers popped out of the woods in front of her, it would be really bad.<br><br>She watched the approaching trees, half expecting her fears to be realized.<br><br>Closer and closer.<br><br>The sound of her audience was coming in from behind her now, and it was getting softer. A good sign! Maybe she'd be Ok!<br><br>Her legs were rubber. She had done a good job setting her pace, timing it so she'd have just enough energy to enter the woods. After that though, she'd HAVE to rest, no matter WHAT the situation.<br><br>A robin's cheerful call urged her on. Just a few more steps!<br><br>There! She made it! She was inside the loving embrace of a willow tree, hidden once more!<br><br>No sign of any hikers, thank goodness. Still, she continued running, wanting to put some distance between herself and the clearing. Out from under the willow and into a second one. Then a third. Her whole body felt rubbery now.<br><br>Enough! She had to stop!<br><br>Gently collapsing onto the soft ground, she lay flat on her back, staring upward into the willow's branches. She was gasping for breath, hungrily taking in great gulps of the surrounding air. The world was slowly spinning.<br><br>She had really pushed herself to the limit! But it was justified. After a couple of minutes went by she started to feel better. Her breathing became more controlled and the rubbery feeling dissipated. The world once again stood still. Fortunately none of the hikers had followed her, so her recovery was undisturbed.<br><br>She rested there for a few more minutes, not moving from her spot or even changing her position. Her only companion was the robin she had heard earlier, its song helping her to relax. Then she wearily stood up, brushed herself off, and began to walk.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Erin only had to walk a short distance before reaching the creek, a goal which had taken far, far longer than originally planned. But now she was here! The peaceful gurgling of the flowing water was welcome to her ears. She splashed some of the cool water on her face - that helped to perk her up.<br><br>All she had to do now was follow the creek to the small waterfall, where she had left her clothes. Then her journey would be over!<br><br>In contrast to the earlier part of her hike, her walk along the creek was uneventful. No weird animals, no mean girls, no hikers - nothing to interfere with either her progress or her modesty. Just like when she had first started her trek, it was only her and the forest.<br><br>The walk was pleasant, although she couldn't get her mind off all the things that had happened, especially her streak past the hikers. Just thinking about it made her face blistering hot all over again.<br><br>There was something else about that episode, too; something she hadn't thought of earlier:<br><br>"What if they took pictures of me?"<br><br>Although she didn't know it at the moment, the hiking club eschewed technology during their hikes, feeling that it diminished their experience. On the other hand, a few club members did carry phones for emergency purposes, and those phones had been brought to bear during her frantic run. This had resulted in some high quality pictures, and even a video. Fortunately for Erin, all of these images had been taken from behind her. Thus, while plenty embarrassing, none of the pictures allowed her to be identified.<br><br>Her walk along the creek only took her a quarter of an hour. Once she had reached the waterfall she easily found the spot where she had hidden her replacement clothing - she had put them in among a pair of large bushes. But as she approached the bushes, she stopped.<br><br>"What if my clothes aren't there?"<br><br>Oddly, that was a possibility she hadn't even considered before. Admittedly, the odds against someone rummaging through those particular bushes, finding the small bag into which she had stored her things, and then taking them was extremely small.<br><br>But it could have happened. Or alternately, an animal could have come along, grabbed the bag in its mouth, and then trotted away with them.<br><br>Now she was afraid to look.<br><br>If her clothes weren't there, the embarrassment she had experienced earlier was nothing compared to what she'd have to face. She'd have to walk out of the woods, as naked as the day she was born, and seek out help. It was unthinkable.<br><br>"please be there..." she whispered.<br><br>She positioned herself between the bushes and carefully reached down. There it was! Her bag! Still closed! Like a long-lost treasure, she picked up the bag and opened it. Yes yes yes! Everything was there!<br><br>She exhaled a long, satisfied sigh of relief.<br><br>Then she got dressed.<br><br>At first it felt strange to be wearing clothing again, but the feeling soon passed. It was time for her to head for home. What a day! This had been an experience she would never, ever forget!<br><br>As she left the confines of the forest, another thought went through her mind. Even though it contained hints of regret, the thought was firm and unyielding: "I'll NEVER do anything like this again!"<br><br>This was a thought that was not open to debate. It was as hard as steel - a 100% certainty.<br><br>Her subconscious mind did not attempt to argue her decision. It knew that would be pointless. Yet it knew her even better than she knew herself, and sometime in the future it would have the opportunity to voice its views. For now, it had to be satisfied with the faintest of whispers: "Want to bet?"<br><br>*****<br><br>Epilogue<br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>It was 2:43 PM.<br><br>Shirley, like her two companions, was about as nervous as was possible for her to be. Little beads of sweat decorated her naked body from the top of her head to the tips of her toes.<br><br>She remained silent and obediently kept her hands on her head. The last thing she wanted was to incur more wrath from Claudette's aunt. The woman was a raving lunatic!<br><br>It didn't help her situation either - not at all - that her bottom was blazing hot and stung like the dickens... a condition that was not going to change any time soon. Claudette had really done a number on her! Even though it was Lenora who had pushed Claudette into spanking her, in her view Claudette hadn't needed to go about her task with quite that level of enthusiasm!<br><br>How had this happened? This wasn't the first time she had met Lenora, nor was it the first time she had swum in her pool. There had never been any issues in the past - no problems at all! She recalled, however, Claudette warning her and Jen about her aunt months ago, when they had first starting using her pool:<br><br>"Don't ever let her catch you in the pool without a suit on. She's nice enough, but she has a few idiosyncrasies."<br><br>"A few idiosyncrasies???" Shirley thought in sarcastic dismay.<br><br>She kept trying to convince herself that Lenora wouldn't carry through with her outrageous threats, that she'd come along and release them. For if she didn't...<br><br>Shirley's eyes scanned the area around her for the umpteenth time.<br><br>2:44 PM.<br><br>She heard a car approaching.<br><br>"This can't be happening," she thought. She looked down at her left ankle, the one tied to Claudette's right ankle. Lenora had wrapped the rope around it several times, then put a knot in it. She had fortunately been careful not to wrap the rope too tightly, but the knot was a different story.<br><br>Shirley clearly recalled the groaning sounds the rope had made when Lenora, using her full strength, had tightened the knot. Looking at it now, it almost appeared as if the outer coating of the rope had melted! Even if she bent down and tried to untie it - an action sure to elicit a most unpleasant response - she doubted she'd be able to succeed with just her hands. Since she had no tools in her possession, she wasn't going anywhere.<br><br>She heard a car door open... then a second one.<br><br>"Oh no," she thought. She couldn't be seen like this!<br><br>From somewhere back behind her, she heard Lenora greeting her early arrivals. There was the sound of polite conversation, and then...<br><br>Shirley heard gasps of astonishment.<br><br>She couldn't see the source of the sounds, and had no desire to turn and look. The reason for the surprise was pretty obvious: they could see her naked bottom! And since her legs were spread wide, they could also see...<br><br>Shirley was mortified.<br><br>She heard Lenora talking to her guests in a low voice, presumably explaining the situation. She could pick up a few of her words, including "naughty," "discipline," and "timeout."<br><br>Then she heard one of the guests, a woman, ask a question:<br><br>"Did they get sunburn? Why are their butts so red?"<br><br>"They all received a well-deserved spanking," Lenora responded helpfully.<br><br>Shirley didn't think anything could possibly be any more humiliating than this.<br><br>Now she could hear Lenora and her guests approaching. They walked past her on the right, then turned around to face her and her two friends. It was a couple in their 30's, both dressed casually in summer attire. The woman was looking over at Claudette, but the man was staring straight at her!<br><br>"I don't believe it," the man said. "I must be dreaming."<br><br>As Shirley watched, the man's eyes moved downward, first stopping at chest level and then fixing at a point just below her waist. Fidgeting under his indecent scrutiny, it took every iota of her willpower to keep her hands on her head and allow him unrestricted viewing.<br><br>After taking a prolonged look, the man moved away to peruse Claudette and Jen. While he was occupied with that task, the woman stood in front of Shirley and looked into her eyes. She had a small smile on her face.<br><br>"I can't even imagine how embarrassing it must be to stand there like that," the woman said, amusement in her voice. "I'm sure glad I'm not in YOUR shoes!"<br><br>Even if Shirley had been allowed to talk, she would have found it difficult to formulate a suitable response.<br><br>"I'll bet you wish you were sitting in some nice cool water," the woman added, her smile turning into a broad smirk.<br><br>With that, the woman walked away, leaving Shirley with two sets of flaming hot cheeks.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Over the next half hour many more guests arrived, sometimes individually and other times in clumps. Some of them, like the first pair, walked right over to the unfortunate girls for a close-up look. Others admired them from afar.<br><br>The guests' reactions varied. Some were astonished at what they saw, with raised eyebrows, open mouths, and gasps. Others found the situation humorous, which from the girls' point of view was worse, for they had to listen to the wide assortment of laughter, chuckles, and giggles directed their way. Not surprisingly there were also a considerable number of guests who found the spectacle enjoyable, and who unabashedly ogled the naked girls.<br><br>Some of the guests went over to the pool, either entering the water or situating themselves in the area around it. Those guests could see the girls from the front. The other guests hovered around the tables in the lawn behind the girls, providing them with a different, but no less interesting, perspective. Some of them sat at the tables and partook of the food Lenora had made available; others stood while they ate, affording them a better view.<br><br>The girls had thus far managed to avoid getting themselves into even more trouble, remaining silent and, incredibly enough, keeping their hands in position. Not only did they have to endure the almost infinite humiliation of having to stand there completely naked with everyone looking at them, but they had to listen to a wide assortment of comments - everything from compliments and appraisals to jokes and taunts. Their scarlet tails were of particular interest to the onlookers, although their other features certainly did not lack for attention.<br><br>Some guests started to take pictures with their phones, but Lenora quickly forbade such activities. Interest in recording the moments for posterity was high, however, so despite her objections a fair number of pictures were discretely taken anyway.<br><br>At 3:15, a young woman standing near Shirley took out her phone, not for a photo but simply to make a call. Shirley could hear her side of the conversation.<br><br>"You've got to get over here! You won't BELIEVE this party!"<br><br>"Yeah, I know you told her you wouldn't be coming, but come anyway!"<br><br>"You don't want to miss this... TRUST me on that!"<br><br>"Great! See you soon!"<br><br>That was the end of the conversation, but, looking around, Shirley saw that a number of other people were also making calls. Most were talking animatedly, and were frequently glancing over at her and her two naked friends. Were they, too, convincing people who originally weren't going to come to the party to change their minds? Under the circumstances that seemed very likely.<br><br>She remembered Lenora saying that she expected seventy guests. But she also recalled Claudette telling her that her aunt had originally invited over three HUNDRED people!<br><br>Shirley groaned silently as she realized that many more people would be stopping by to see her - naked, spanked, and spread.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Shirley looked at the pool which Lenora was making them face as part of their punishment. She really, really wished she had worn her bathing suit!<br><br>But then she corrected herself. It wasn't the pool, or skinny dipping in it, that had gotten her into this situation. It was THAT GIRL! When Claudette had suggested catching and humiliating her, she had been all for the idea. Jen had too. But somehow their plan had gone horribly wrong. Somehow that girl had turned the tables on them. It shouldn't have been possible.<br><br>As Shirley was ruing her situation, a small group of young men and women wandered over. She recognized them - it was people that neither she nor her two friends liked at all. Unfortunately, the feeling was mutual.<br><br>The group made a show of enjoying their plight, laughing at them and making rude comments about their features. Shirley had had plenty of practice now keeping her hands on her head, but having to expose herself to people she intensely disliked while they ridiculed her really tested her limits.<br><br>She glanced over at Claudette; her naked friend, like her, was stoically keeping herself in position.<br><br>"I told you to keep your hands on your head!"<br><br>Lenora's voice rose above the party's din.<br><br>"But I AM keeping my hands on my head!" thought Shirley. "And Claudette is too! And Jen.......... oh crap."<br><br>The situation had proved too difficult for the small blonde, for she had taken her hands off her head and was using them to cover herself as best she could.<br><br>"I WARNED you!" Lenora said.<br><br>Jen quickly returned her hands to the top of her head, but the damage had already been done.<br><br>"That's TWO MORE HOURS of timeout for the three of you! And if there are any more mishaps, it'll be even LONGER!"<br><br>"It's 3:15. Your timeout will end at 6:30," Lenora informed them.<br><br>Shirley's mind was reeling. Over three more hours like this? With the crowd of spectators growing larger by the minute?<br><br>The group who had instigated the girls' latest misfortune walked away, chuckling loudly among themselves. They seemed quite pleased with the turn of events, and made sure the three hapless girls knew it.<br><br>Shirley looked over at Claudette and Jen; they both looked every bit as stunned by Lenora's words as she was.<br><br>"At least I'm not alone," Shirley thought, trying to find a bright spot, no matter how small, with her situation. The audience's attention would be divided among the three of them, rather than on her alone. It wasn't much of a consolation, but at least it was something!<br><br>With that thought in mind, Shirley took a look around her. Seeing all the people watching her, one thing was abundantly clear: the audience was more than capable of giving her all the attention she could ever possibly hope for.<br><br>No, it wasn't much of a consolation at all.<br><br>Then Shirley saw one of the members of the group that had just gotten them into trouble walking back in her direction. It was a young woman called Katie. Shirley had a particular dislike for her, for the two had had some issues in the past.<br><br>Now what? Shirley prepared herself for some more taunts.<br><br>But Katie didn't say anything. Instead, she pulled out an expensive-looking camera. Unbeknownst to Shirley, Katie's friends were currently engaged in conversation with Lenora, distracting her from what Katie was doing.<br><br>Katie quickly took some close-up photos of Shirley, aiming her camera at places at which a camera really shouldn't be aimed. She then did the same to Claudette and Jen. Her resulting photos were impressive studies in contrast, their quality being quite high but their appropriateness quite low.<br><br>Katie then finished off her session with a snap of each of the three girls' faces. She gave Shirley a big smile, then walked back over to rejoin her friends.<br><br>Shirley couldn't help but wonder what Katie planned to do with those pictures. She knew that Katie was an active member of a number of photography sites, but surely she couldn't post something like that on those. Could she?<br><br>Shirley decided she probably didn't want the answer to that question.<br><br>"I wonder what that girl is up to." Shirley's mind helpfully switched to another topic. "Is she still roaming around the woods naked?"<br><br>They had never even asked Erin her name, their only interest being in humiliating her.<br><br>"No, she's probably long gone by now, and back in clothes again."<br><br>That was a state Shirley sincerely wished she was in right now. But that wasn't going to happen until 6:30.<br><br>She heard the sound of several vehicles approaching, signifying the arrival of even more guests.<br><br>6:30 was a long way off.<br><br>*****<br><br>   Epilogue   2<br><br> *****<br><br><br><br>When Erin got back to her apartment, she took a quick shower, then threw on a pair of shorts and a top. The girl she shared her apartment with was out, so she was by herself for the moment. She sat on the couch with the intention of watching a little TV. But the exhaustion resulting from the day's extraordinary events quickly caught up with her - within 30 seconds of sitting down she fell fast asleep.<br><br><Knock knock knock><br><br>"Huh?... what?..."<br><br>As fate would have it, just minutes after she had entered slumberland the sound of knocking woke her up. It took her a few moments to identify the sound, then she groggily made her way to the door and opened it.<br><br>It was her best friend from school, Lilly.<br><br>"Erin!" her friend said exuberantly. "Let's go out for a drink! I have some big news for you!"<br><br>Going out for a drink - a soda or an iced tea - was something Erin and Lilly did often. Under other circumstances Erin would have immediately acceded to her friend's request, but it just wasn't a good time for her to go. She needed to sleep!<br><br>"I'm kind of tired..." Erin said.<br><br>"That's Ok," Lilly responded, unperturbed. "We don't have to stay out long."<br><br>"But..." Erin whimpered.<br><br>"Don't be such a wuss," Lilly said, smiling. "Come on!"<br><br>With that, Lilly grabbed her friend by the wrist and gave her a tug.<br><br>Erin made another attempt to resist her bubbly friend: "Can't you just tell me here?"<br><br>Lilly looked back at her with sad, puppy-dog eyes.<br><br>Erin sighed and surrendered. "Ok, just for a little while..."<br><br>Lilly instantly looked cheerful again. Still holding her friend's wrist, she assisted Erin out the door.<br><br>They got into Lilly's car. After putting her safety belt on, Erin nestled herself into Lilly's comfortable front passenger-side seat. Before they had even left the parking lot, Erin fell back to sleep.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>A willow branch was poking her in the side. It didn't hurt; it was just annoying. Why was it doing that?<br><br>"Wake up!" the willow told her.<br><br>"ZZzzz....ohhh....uhhh...."<br><br>Erin woke up - sort of. She was at least able to determine that it was her friend, and not a willow tree, who kept poking her.<br><br>Erin managed to get herself out of the car, but she was nearly asleep on her feet. Lilly guided her across a plush carpet, weaving through a crowd, and to a table. Erin automatically sat down opposite her friend. A moment later her head began to descend toward the table's surface. Then her nose twitched.<br><br>"I smell fries," Erin said, hanging onto consciousness. She hadn't realized it until just now, but she was pretty hungry.<br><br>Lilly watched her friend with amusement. "How about if I go grab us some drinks. I'll get some fries, too!"<br><br>"Uh huh," Erin mumbled. Then she promptly fell asleep, her head resting on her arms.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>A young woman dressed in hiking gear was gently shaking her left shoulder. Erin looked over at her, mildly annoyed. Then she realized she didn't have anything on! She was naked!<br><br>"Where are my clothes?!?" Erin asked emphatically.<br><br>"Whoa!" Lilly's voice cut into her dream.<br><br>As Erin woke up to Lilly's hand on her shoulder, her friend laughed and said, "A naked dream, huh? Ha ha ha - yeah, I have those sometimes. I'll be in class, sitting there taking notes, and then I realize I'm not wearing anything at all! Fortunately I wake up before things get too out of hand!"<br><br>Erin blushed as she realized she had asked about her clothes out loud. That helped her wake up, at least a little.<br><br>"So, are you ready for the news?" Lilly asked, expectation in her voice.<br><br>"Might as well get this over with," Erin thought. She REALLY needed to get back home so she could sleep! Sniff sniff. Well, after she had some fries, that is. Lilly had placed a big plateful of them on the table, along with a few other snacks and a couple of iced teas.<br><br>"Come sit over here," Lilly instructed, patting the seat to her left.<br><br>Erin thought that was a little odd - why couldn't Lilly tell her the news when they were facing each other? That's the way they always sat when they went out. But whatever. Erin grabbed some fries and put them in her mouth. Yum. She stood up as she munched away. Seeing the stars above, she realized they were actually in an outdoor cafe. That was fine, although the warm air made it even harder to stay awake. She sat back down in the indicated seat.<br><br>As she took in the view from her new vantage point, something caught her eye.<br><br>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>In an instant, Erin was fully awake.<br><br>Just a short distance away, she saw the backs of three girls, all stark naked. They had their hands on their heads, their legs were spread, and their bottoms were bright red.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>From the look on her face, it was obvious to Lilly that her friend had finally noticed the "news" she had promised her.<br><br>"Bet you didn't expect to see anything like THIS, huh?" she prompted.<br><br>Erin didn't respond; she was frozen in place, with her eyebrows at their maximum elevation.<br><br>"I had originally turned down my invitation to this party," Lilly explained, "but then I got a phone call. When I heard what was going on here, I just had to come!"<br><br>Erin sat there trying to take it all in.<br><br>"I was allowed to bring a guest, so naturally I thought of you!"<br><br>Still no response.<br><br>"Uh, hello?" Lilly said, gently knocking on the top of Erin's head. "Anyone home?"<br><br>"We have to get out of here!" Erin finally replied.<br><br>Her response was not at all what Lilly expected. With a puzzled frown, she asked, "Why?"<br><br>That was a question Erin clearly couldn't answer. She tried to invent a plausible-sounding reason, but she was having a lot of trouble thinking. It didn't help when she spotted Lenora sitting just two tables away!<br><br>"Why don't you eat some more of your fries?" Lilly suggested, hoping the nourishment would help settle her oddly-behaving friend.<br><br>That turned out to be a good suggestion, one that Erin accepted. The shock of finding herself back at Lenora's house began to wear off as she hungrily devoured the fries, as well as some of the other food Lilly had provided.<br><br>As she and her friend ate, Erin thought, "I'm actually Ok being here. No one knows what I did earlier - no one except those girls, and they can't see me. All I have to do is play things cool."<br><br>Just as they were finishing up their meal, the party's hostess came over to their table.<br><br>"Hello girls," Lenora said cheerfully. "I hope you're enjoying my party!"<br><br>Lilly replied immediately, "Yes, we sure are!"<br><br>Lenora looked over at Erin, awaiting her response.<br><br>"Yes ma'am," Erin squeaked, trying not to stare at the muscular woman, but doing exactly that. She was extremely nervous.<br><br>Lenora was giving her a strange look. Erin thought she'd better say something else, so, forcing a smile onto her face, she added, "It's a very nice party!"<br><br>Despite her efforts, she had been unable to keep the tension out of her voice.<br><br>Misinterpreting the reason for Erin's nervousness, Lenora laughed. Then she rubbed the muscles of her upper right arm and said, "Don't let these fool you! I'm the easiest person in the world to get along with!"<br><br>"Yes ma'am," Erin responded politely.<br><br>Lenora laughed again. Maybe it was Erin's uneasiness, or perhaps her over politeness, but in any case Lenora seemed to like her.<br><br>"Hey," Lilly said, "let's go over to the pool."<br><br>Lilly wanted to get a better look at the party's star attractions. But that was absolutely the last thing Erin wanted to do. If those girls saw her...<br><br>Erin stayed sitting.<br><br>"Sure, I'll walk over with you," Lenora said.<br><br>"Come on!" Lilly said, grabbing Erin's wrist and giving her a tug.<br><br>Erin stood up. She didn't see that she had any choice. If she refused to go over it would draw Lenora's attention to her. Lenora would wonder exactly WHY she was so reluctant. She might recall some of the things her niece and friends were trying to tell her earlier. She might even start to realize that they had been telling her the truth. That wouldn't be good.<br><br>The three began walking toward the pool - and the three naked girls - with Lilly practically dragging Erin along with her. It didn't take them long to get there. They walked past Jen, then positioned themselves directly in front of Claudette.<br><br>Erin's eyes met Claudette's.<br><br>She saw recognition and anger flash across the tall girl's face.<br><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br><br>Seeing Erin standing there in front of her caused Claudette to react without thinking. She began to lunge toward her, intending to grab her. She caught herself almost immediately, for the last thing she needed was to get into even more trouble with her aunt. Unfortunately she had already leaned forward enough to throw herself off balance.<br><br>Claudette began to fall forward.<br><br>Reacting instinctively, she threw out her hands to break her fall. Fortunately, her hands gained purchase on something which gave her the leverage she needed to regain her balance. Unfortunately, her hands had chosen an awkward target.<br><br>"YEEEEEEPPP!!!!" Erin yelped in response to Claudette's hands on her breasts.<br><br>Claudette quickly put her hands back on her head, but it was far too late.<br><br>"CLAUDETTE!!!" her shocked aunt exclaimed.<br><br>Claudette briefly considered trying to tell her aunt that THIS was the girl they had found naked in the woods. But she knew that not only would her aunt still not believe her, but it would likely make the situation worse... if that was even possible.<br><br>"What are you DOING???" Lenora queried.<br><br>"What's the matter with you???"<br><br>"How DARE you molest this poor girl!"<br><br>Had Jen not been burned earlier when she covered herself, she would likely have said something at this point. But, clearly recalling what had happened the last time she had broken one of Lenora's rules, Jen kept her mouth shut. Shirley, like Claudette, was smart enough to know that throwing out accusations which they couldn't substantiate just wouldn't work.<br><br>Thus the three naked girls all held their tongues.<br><br>"THAT'S THREE MORE HOURS OF TIMEOUT!" Lenora proclaimed.<br><br>Once again, Erin's and Claudette's eyes met. It was fortunate that peoples' stares have no inherent power, for if they did, Erin would have been instantly vaporized by the looks Claudette was giving her.<br><br>Lilly, amused and bemused by Claudette's "interaction" with her friend, whispered to Erin, "She must really like you!" Giggling, she added, "She sure was forward about it though."<br><br>"Maybe we should go now," Erin suggested.<br><br>"Sure, sure," Lilly agreed. "But can you imagine having to stand there like that? For hours? In front of all these people? And did you see their butts? Holy shit!"<br><br>"I wonder what they did, to end up like this," Erin said, playing dumb.<br><br>"From what I gather," Lilly answered, "all they did was skinny dip in their pool!"<br><br>"Really? Oh, wow. I'll bet they sure are regretting their actions!"<br><br>Erin's hidden meaning was lost on Lilly, but not on Claudette and her cohorts.<br><br>"Ha ha, yeah, I'll bet so too!" Lilly answered.<br><br>Having seen enough now, Lilly began to walk away. This time there was no need to pull Erin along with her.<br><br>"Oh... I can't do that."<br><br>Lenora's voice made them pause.<br><br>"You girls must be getting hungry," Lenora pointed out. "I can't make you stand there for that long when you're hungry. That would be mean."<br><br>Lenora's definition of what was and wasn't mean might have been a little odd, but it made sense to her.<br><br>Both Lilly and Erin continued listening, curious as to where this was going.<br><br>"It's 5:45 now," Lenora continued. "I'll tell you what - I'll only give you ONE extra hour of timeout. That means your punishment will be over at 7:30. Then you can get something to eat."<br><br>Erin had no objections to this. She had had some first-hand experience with humiliation, being seen naked for just a short time. What these girls had already endured, and were continuing to endure, was truly unthinkable in comparison. Plus she had to agree with Lenora that it would be too mean to not let them eat.<br><br>"In return," Lenora continued, "I expect you to help me out with my party. For some reason there are a lot more guests here than I originally planned for. You can do odds and ends - get drinks for people, clean the tables, pick up trash, and so forth. Now my party doesn't end until midnight, so you'll have a bit of work ahead of you."<br><br>"Hmmm... I guess I'll leave it up to you. Will you help out with the party in exchange for only one extra hour of timeout instead of three?"<br><br>Claudette, Jen, and Shirley all nodded their affirmation.<br><br>"Great," Lenora confirmed. "Oh, and by the way - I expect you to be polite and on your best behavior while you're helping. If not... well, I can always make your bottoms even redder and put you back into timeout."<br><br>Erin was sure the girls wouldn't do anything to anger Claudette's aunt. They'd be just as courteous, helpful, and polite as was possible to be. Even so, it would be awfully embarrassing to have to be around all those people who had just seen them naked!<br><br>Then Erin thought of something else. There would undoubtedly be some guests who would want to see them get into more trouble. Guests who knew them but didn't like them, for example. Those guests would be deliberately rude just to try to get a rise out of them. Claudette, Jen, and Shirley were going to find it quite challenging to constantly stay nice to everyone!<br><br>Lilly and Erin began to walk away again. The massive shot of adrenaline that Erin had received when she saw Claudette and her two friends was starting to wear off. Well fed now, it was time for her to get home and crawl into bed.<br><br>Erin had an interesting night in store for her, a night filled with wild, vivid dreams.<br><br>Just as they were getting out of earshot, they heard one final statement from Lenora, a statement that widened Erin's eyes and would work itself into her upcoming dreams: "When my party is over, then you can go into the house and get your clothes."`
