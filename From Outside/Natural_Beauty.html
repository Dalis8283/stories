The flight had taken just under three hours. It was uneventful; but as our plane began its final approach in a wide arc high above the crystal-clear Caribbean Sea, a buzz of excitement filled the cabin. Although I was in the aisle seat, as the plane banked I got a clear view of the gorgeous vista below us.<br>
<br>
From the air Palmira reveals itself as a sublime tropical island paradise, with topaz-blue coral reefs, black and silver sand beaches, verdant hillsides and green-skirted rocky ridges, resplendently bathed in golden sunlight. The broad inlet over which we were descending teemed with yachts and skiffs and fishing boats. In the middle of the bay a cruise ship lay at anchor. I could easily make out from their gleaming wakes etched upon the water a fleet of small ferries delivering passengers to the quay. Onshore, following the curve of the coastline, neat rows of buildings gleamed brilliant white and vivid pink, climbing the forest-covered slopes that enclosed the town of RÃ©gate in a vast, viridian amphitheatre.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere on a plane full of holidaymakers is generally the same wherever the destination. There's euphoria as you take off, settling into quiet languor as time passes, perking once more as the end of the journey nears, turning into mild apprehension during the descent and landing, surging to elation when you come to a halt. But even as we touched down, the mood had changed again. The female passengers, including myself, became quieter and more introspective as the flight attendants opened the doors and a gust of warm, humid air swirled through the cabin.<br>
<br>
Sitting across the aisle from me were a couple whom I judged, by their lovey-dovey expressions, to be honeymooners. The young man had gone silent and was tightly clenching his fists. His face had a greenish pallor; and when we'd stopped on the runway I heard an audible sigh of relief. His new wife was frowning and fidgety; but hers were not so much in-flight nerves. Meanwhile, the girl in the window seat next to me was gripping the armrest so tightly that her knuckles were white. I would have put this down also to fear of flying, except that she had been in high spirits at take-off. It was the landing -- or rather, where we were landing -- which now made her jittery. To my reassuring smile she replied with a grin and a wink. She was wearing a cheery, canary yellow sundress; and as she stood up she tugged demurely downwards on the hem.<br>
<br>
The flight attendant's announcement while we were still taxiing had reinforced the feelings of trepidation and exhilaration.<br>
<br>
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Palmira. The local time is one o'clock, the temperature is twenty-nine degrees Celsius, eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit, the weather is fine with a light south-easterly breeze." And after the standard admonitions about staying seated and belted: "On behalf of Palmair and the crew, I'd like to thank you for flying with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again in the near future. We wish you a very enjoyable stay. As you leave the aeroplane, please have your passports and customs declarations at hand for inspection; and ladies, be ready to undress."<br>
<br>
Palmira's is smaller than the average international airport, but the protocols and formalities are the same. Ours and a charter plane were the only aircraft on the tarmac, and the terminal was uncrowded, so I and my fellow passengers could expect a quick and easy process. But heading towards the baggage collection area we slowed, as we beheld the first nude women. Beyond the glass partition, airport staff could be seen going about their jobs. The females were without exception stunning to look at, their bare skin glistening a variety of hues from ivory to ebony. Most were moving briskly and busily, but underneath a sign announcing "ARRIVALS" a half-dozen young women were standing, carrying boards inscribed with the names of hotels and tour operators. Each held her placard above her head or out to one side, so as not to obscure any portion of her torso.<br>
<br>
As I absorbed this fascinating scene, the newly wedded woman squeezed her husband's arm. She was wide-eyed and open-mouthed. I looked around at the other females in our group. Those of us who were first-time visitors were staring, none uttering a sound (except for a few gasps and giggles). The attention of the males was equally riveted. We were entranced by this opening encounter with the full-frontal reality of Palmira.<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br></p>
I learned about Palmira when I was a little girl because my grandmother was born there. I'd heard romantic tales and fabulous legends of bold buccaneers and intrepid mariners and their hardy womenfolk. But I knew little about the contemporary lifestyle, until I chanced upon an old travel magazine. It was one of those glossy-format publications with pretensions to cultural significance, full of "gee whiz!" prose and pretty pictures. This edition featured an article, "My Journey to the Caribbean's Exotic Island of Naked Women."<br>
<br>
For a teenager still coming to terms with her own sexuality, I found the story and the (tasteful) images both provocative and intriguing. Grandma never spoke much about her experiences, but she did disclose something of her background. Her Palmirene lineage purportedly goes back three centuries. There is a tradition that my great-great-etcetera-grandmother had been taken there as a captive by pirates. She wed one of them, raised many children and became a local matriarch. That may be a myth; but her family today are one of the island's wealthiest, descendants of a merchant aristocracy who until recently ruled Palmira.<br>
<br>
We occasionally visited Grandpa's birthplace in England, but never Grandma's. They had met when he was on Palmira as part of a hydrological survey team. They married and eventually settled in Australia; and when my mother was born they stopped going back to the island. The magazine article was written a decade after their departure and the place had changed a lot, in the wake of a big influx of tourists during the 1960s. But one thing remained constant, and has to this day -- the famous (or infamous, depending on your point of view) nude law.<br>
<br>
"To celebrate the natural beauty of the female body, women are forbidden to wear clothing."<br>
<br>
Although I did not anticipate ever going there, I hadn't lost my interest in Palmira. Nudity never bothered me. I'm pleased with my body which I keep trim with daily exercise and a healthy diet; and I've enjoyed showing it off in a barely-there bikini. When I was a university student my girlfriends and I often went topless, sometimes bottomless, on a beach near the campus. So I'm not shy. On the other hand, I am not conventionally sexy or girlie-girl feminine. This is partly on account of my profession. I'm a cultural anthropologist who spends much of her year on archaeological diggings where there's not much call for frills, frocks and lipstick.<br>
<br>
In fact, it was my career which took me to Palmira. In recent times, a lot of interest has been aroused in the island's archaeological heritage. Once neglected, the study of pre-Columbian settlement in this part of the Caribbean region has taken off. The Palmirene government has sponsored excavations on the island as a prestige project, and some remarkable finds have been made. These remains are evidence of ancient links between the islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, long before the arrival of the (peaceful) Arawaks and later the (warlike) Caribs.<br>
<br>
I had been working on and off for nearly five years in the Australian outback, at well-known locations such as Lake Mungo where the continent's oldest human fossils have been unearthed, Box Gully and Kow Swamp. I love the fieldwork but had been contemplating a change of scenery and focus. So when I heard that a postdoctoral research fellowship was being offered by Palmira College, I considered my options. The remuneration was nothing special, an allowance really, but my airfares, accommodation and meals would be paid for. More importantly, the modest scale of the excavations would provide an opportunity for me to be for once a key player on the dig. Even so, I didn't exactly jump at the chance; but I somehow felt it was my destiny to spend a year in the fabled homeland of some of my ancestors (and living relatives).<br>
<br>
I received word of my successful application shortly before my twenty-sixth birthday. I'm not averse to admitting that my family connection, though tenuous, may have been a factor. The starting date was still months away, but there were orientation sessions to be attended, via video conferencing. These concentrated on technical issues and not so much the local lifestyle. During them I got acquainted with my future colleagues. It's a multinational enterprise. The director is an Oregon-based ethno-archaeologist, Professor Rebecca Hayden.<br>
<br>
However, the fact that Palmira would be different from any of the places I'd worked at so far became obvious during our very first online meeting. I had been joined by Daniel, who was halfway through his Master's degree program. As his academic adviser, I'd convinced him that a stint on Palmira would be good for his curriculum vitae. Suffice it to say, he didn't need much encouraging.<br>
<br>
Most of Rebecca's associates had returned to their home bases because it was the island's wet season, but she and her deputy, Mike Renshaw, had stayed on. They appeared on-screen with Marcia Robbins, curator of the Palmira Museum. While Mike wore a colourful Balinese batik shirt, his colleagues, visible from the waist up, were bare-breasted. Aged in their early forties, both women are very attractive. Rebecca has sun-bronzed skin, cornflower-blue eyes and copper-red hair normally tied back severely in a ponytail. Marcia is dark-eyed, mahogany-skinned and raven-haired. Neither of their torsos showed any hint of tan lines.<br>
<br>
Daniel gasped. I was surprised that he wasn't better prepared for this unadorned introduction to Palmirene culture. Of course, he didn't have my background. Yet it was hard for me to not feel some embarrassment, sitting alongside him and seeing these women so unabashedly exposed. But they smiled indulgently and the conference went on in an otherwise normal way.<br>
<br>
During my twelve months on the island, I would be dividing my professional time between excavations in the field and educational duties at Palmira College. That a relatively small community can boast such an institution is a tribute to the far-sightedness of successive governments, who have promoted tertiary education to prevent a "brain drain" by keeping and attracting educated young people. It was once affiliated with the University of the West Indies but is now fully autonomous, with two campuses. I would be based at the postgraduate school in the capital, RÃ©gate. The undergraduate campus and Palmira Museum are located in the nearby community of Grandin, an enclave with its own by-laws where most of Palmira's families live.<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br></p>
I had discussed my decision to go to Palmira with my family, especially Grandma. They were supportive, if perhaps a little perplexed. My boyfriend Matthew, who was used to having a long-distance relationship, accepted this latest one with equanimity; but I noted that he seemed keener about visiting me on Palmira than he did when I was working in the wilderness.<br>
<br>
I travelled alone; Daniel would not be joining me for another few weeks. Flights from Australia do not proceed directly to Palmira because the island's airport cannot handle the big jets. So I stayed overnight in Kingston, Jamaica, to fly on a smaller plane the next day. The check-in area was located at one end of the terminal, and a queue had begun to form when I arrived. It was a little disquieting to be standing under the destination sign as passers-by en route to other, less exotic places turned to stare at us. Most knew about Palmira; and they must have noticed that we women carried less luggage than the average tourist.<br>
<br>
There were about fifty people on board our aircraft. Most were in couples, including the honeymooners seated across from me, and generally of about my age. Directly in front of me were two girls whose sartorial style was a kind of punk-goth fusion and who spent most of the three-hour trip cuddling and giggling. There was an all-girl group of six in their early twenties, and half a dozen solo women (including myself and the young lady next to me), but no single men. Most of the females were dressed in skimpy fashion, although really no less than if we'd been on our way to any tropical island resort.<br>
<br>
At the rear of the cabin were a woman and two younger males in spruce dark suits, hunched over open attachÃ© cases and laptops. The woman, who seemed in charge, looked vaguely familiar. She and her companions had not been in the Kingston queue, and when they went past my seat I heard them speaking in the Palmirene dialect. (This is a Creole English. I have studied languages as part of my ethnographic research. Palmirene speech retains an old-fashioned quality but has been strongly influenced by immigration from Europe and the Americas, including other parts of the Caribbean.)<br>
<br>
Our aircrew were smartly attired in spick-and-span uniforms. The two flight attendants wore short sea-green dresses. The captain, who came back to say hello, was an attractive woman with emerald eyes and close-cropped, ash-blonde hair. She displayed the no-nonsense congeniality of a veteran and spoke with a faint Canadian accent mellowed by several years of living and working in the West Indies. She had on a snugly fitting white blouse and a black miniskirt, without stockings. It was a more revealing outfit than you might expect on an airline pilot, but by no means risquÃ©. But when we were inside the terminal awaiting the arrival of our bags, they passed us by, towing their trolley-cases. The women had taken off their uniforms and underwear. The captain's skirt and blouse were draped over one arm, her bra and panties resting neatly on top. Her co-pilot, who was the only male in the group, had not even loosened his tie and seemed oblivious to the unclad forms of his fellow crew members. Despite my having primed myself for this, the scene was still breathtaking.<br>
<br>
Nearby, another scene caught my attention. While the rest of us gathered to retrieve our luggage, the three people from the rear of the plane were ushered past the customs inspection area. They halted in an alcove just within our view. We watched as the woman took off her clothes. She carefully folded each item before handing it to one of the young men. She even removed her shoes, earrings and wristwatch. Her undressing laid bare a slim but shapely figure. Her brown skin glistened. And as she stripped, she was nonchalantly giving instructions to her assistants and nodding silent, friendly greetings to the customs and immigration officers. That's when I recognized her (from a photo in the online guidebook) -- Palmira's Minister for Tourism. I was as impressed by the lack of pomp and ceremony which attended the arrival of a government official as by her casual, comfortable nudity.<br>
<br>
"Welcome to Palmira," one of the ladies near me whispered.<br>
<br>
As we turned our attention back to the baggage conveyor, a further curious tableau presented itself. The passengers from the charter plane included a family -- mother, father and two adolescent boys. The woman was tall and well-built, with silky-sheen, chestnut-brown skin and glossy black, ornamentally woven hair. The man was almost half a head shorter than his statuesque wife, stout and balding and bearing the sullen, harried expression which you often see on the faces of the domestically downtrodden. He wore dapper, neatly pressed white trousers, a floral pattern shirt and a red neckerchief. Creating a somewhat comical effect, the boys were dressed almost the same as their father.<br>
<br>
The woman had already shed her clothing. She seemed completely at ease with her nudity, like the other women in the terminal making no attempt to conceal anything. Between her thighs, a luxuriant growth proclaimed her marital status. (According to the guidebook, the local custom is that only single women remove their pubic hair.) She held herself erect, her shoulders drawn subtly backwards, accentuating her breasts. One leg was poised just forward of the other, bent slightly at the knee. Her posture was a most intriguing blend of coy, modest and provocative. She seemed in no way self-conscious, standing there stripped and exposed, her fully clothed husband and sons by her side. To each of them, this was totally natural.<br>
<br>
The woman's composure contrasted with the agitation of her husband, who was impatient for the arrival of their suitcases, and with the frenetic energy of their sons. When one of the boys was just about to climb onto the carousel, Mama seized him by the collar and hauled him back to her side. He remained there with his brother, surly but obedient, until their bags had been retrieved. Watching them, I was fascinated by this image of a typically matriarchal Palmirene family. The woman's dominion was not at all compromised by the fact that she was forbidden by law to conceal any part of her body.<br>
<br>
We proceeded to the customs checkpoint and I was one of the last to go through. The officer on my line was a ruddy-complexioned man in dark trousers, a white shirt and a navy-blue tie. He glanced at my one bag of luggage at my gear and waved me on. Supervising the proceedings was a woman whose only accoutrements were a blue armband and a blue ribbon choker. She perused some paperwork and spoke briefly to the man, who offered her an amiable salute. Neither seemed mindful of the eloquent symbolism of this gesture, a man in uniform acknowledging the authority of a completely nude female.<br>
<br>
By the time we reached the arrivals lounge, the other people from our flight were already experiencing, at first hand, life on the island of Palmira. The women were undressing. Some appeared relaxed -- those who weren't first-time visitors or who were otherwise uninhibited. The rest revealed various degrees of reservation and embarrassment. Some giggled nervously, while others showed tight-lipped bravado. The all-girl group used teasing and playful banter to overcome their bashfulness. The only women in the room who revelled openly in their striptease were the goth-punk pair, laughing and larking as they peeled the clothes off each other's bodies. Some of the men assisted their ladies, but most just stood back and observed, solicitous and sympathetic to any lingering shyness, but loving the show.<br>
<br>
None of us would be here if we were scared or unwilling. Most women who visit Palmira familiarize themselves before leaving home, on topless and nudist beaches. But this was not a private display in a secluded sanctuary; it was a very public place. Adding to the slight sense of discomfiture that I and most of the other women felt were the facts that the nudity was compulsory and it was one-sided. As we stripped naked, the men remained fully clothed. Also, I'd expected our disrobing debut to be more discreet. Yet this was probably the best initiation, since we were going to be exposed in public anyway. Nevertheless, to maintain some dignity and decorum there was a sign on the wall which decreed "NO CAMERAS".<br>
<br>
Of course, what we were feeling was an essential part of our adventure. I recalled my undergraduate days in an on-campus student residence, when we dared each other to run naked down the corridors, across the foyer, through the dining hall and even around the outside of the building. It was almost always us girls who took up the challenge. The males preferred the role of onlookers, supporters and provocateurs. It would have been pointless without an audience, and if many of the spectators were unsuspecting and unprepared for the performance, that enhanced its piquancy for us. We overcame our shame and put aside our dread for the pursuit of a thrill. That feeling was now returning, not so energetic but just as intense.<br>
<br>
So in more ways than one I had rehearsed for this moment of truth. Still, my feelings were mixed, and my ambivalence was not resolved by the behaviour of a couple nearby. From the evidence of their briefcases and the man's attire I concluded they were on some form of official business. As the woman removed her clothes they were engaged in a bizarrely mundane conversation, and she was doing most of the talking. "Don't forget the duty-free... I hope the kids don't get up to mischief... Are you sure you cancelled the newspapers?" Either she was covering up her nerves, or she really was this blasÃ©; it was hard to tell. Yet she fondled each article of her discarded clothing before handing it to her husband, as if it were a precious jewel.<br>
<br>
The distraction proved useful. Without thinking I had pushed the straps of my dress and bra off my shoulders. But as I reached behind my back to draw down the zip, I could feel the gaze of the people, especially the males, around me. Most of the women in the room were already naked; but it's an interesting aspect of our psychology that the act of undressing seems to evoke an even stronger response than the resulting nudity. And as I stripped, I noticed how much I was focused on doing what one normally does without thinking. I allowed my dress to drop freely to my hips, and it fell into a heap around my ankles when I wiggled my derriÃ¨re. I reached behind my back to undo the clasp and then, sucking in a deep breath, plucked my bra from my chest. I immediately regretted my flourish, because my breasts wobbled, welcoming their newfound freedom. This sensation, combined with my mood, had the inevitable effect. I felt my face becoming flushed and a telltale tingling in my nipples as they began to harden. But I wasn't alone in experiencing that.<br>
<br>
I stepped out of my dress and crouched to neatly fold it and place it, with my bra, in my duffel bag. I don't really know if I was stalling, but I took my time doing it. I still wore my knickers, the final piece of clothing, small as it was, which attached me to the world beyond the shores of Palmira. When that was gone, I would be giving up a part of myself. For the next year, people would gaze upon my naked form, viewing my most intimate places, sharing my body. Taking another deep breath, I stood up and pushed my panties down my thighs. For a few seconds I remained slightly bent forward, partly shielding my nakedness from view. But once I'd removed my briefs completely, I held myself proudly erect, clad only my Balenciaga slingback sandals.<br>
<br>
It was a strange situation. There were about fifty people in the room and thirty were bare-skinned, so I was hardly on my own. It's the same throughout Palmira; more than sixty per cent of the adult population, local and visitor, are naked. Yet I felt no refuge in numbers. Indeed, the fact that every woman is naked makes the experience more intense. Still, it's liberating. You feel flattered and honored, even privileged, because it is the raison d'Ãªtre of the nude law "to celebrate the natural beauty of the female body."<br>
<br>
Contemplating this, I'd become so lost in thought that when I finally looked about I saw that people had begun to move off. I reached down for my bag but my hand was politely brushed aside by a young man who picked it up instead.<br>
<br>
I recoiled at his touch. This was purely reflex and I felt ashamed, as if I'd lost my nerve and failed my first test. But I don't think he noticed... or he was accustomed to the jitters of neophyte nudists.<br>
<br>
"Welcome to Palmira," I heard once more.<br>
<br>
It was a woman's voice, mellow and melodious. Marcia Robbins is as striking in the flesh as she is on a screen. (And the expression "in the flesh" had now taken on a whole new meaning!) She has a sophisticated, dignified style, in a way rather intimidating, especially how she looks at you with luminous, hypnotic eyes under arched brows. Her inflections are as smooth as honey but she speaks with unmistakable authority. She introduced her assistant, Ricardo. He's good-looking but was dressed like an apparition out of a vintage tourist brochure, wearing cream pleated slacks, a flamboyant Aloha shirt, Venetian loafers and aviator Ray-Bans perched atop a pink Panama hat. His demeanor betrayed not a trace of whimsy, so I couldn't tell if his attire was meant to be ironical. Of course, next to his naked boss he looked almost straightlaced.<br>
<br>
Marcia had with her a small suitcase and was holding an airline ticket. She apologized that she would not be staying, but assured me that Ricardo would do a good job of showing me around. He nodded benignly.<br>
<br>
Although a native of Palmira, Marcia spends half of the year in Toronto, where she's a professor of anthropology. A century after their forebears began to settle down from their peripatetic ways, many Palmirenes still maintain an itinerant way of life. For the women in particular, coming home must be a bracing experience.<br>
<br>
Ricardo and I left Marcia in the departure lounge where several women were putting clothes on rather than taking them off. We crossed the terminal in silence, Ricardo thoughtfully allowing me to acclimatize. Ahead of us, the all-girl group crowded the exit doors, laughing and mocking and daring each other to be the first out. We eased past them, emerging into brilliant sunlight. Over the doorway, a sign in big red lettering declared:
<br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 130%; text-align: center;">"NO ADULT FEMALE WEARING CLOTHES<br><br>
MAY PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT."</p>

        <div id="chapter2" class="chapter-content">
Palmira's airport commands exquisite views, in one direction an empyreal-blue ocean of startling clarity, in the other leafy hillsides dotted with neat, whitewashed houses, and between them the picture-postcard town of RÃ©gate spread out along the arc of the bay.<br>
<br>
The pavement of the terminal concourse shimmered in the early afternoon heat. Lined up on the roadside were several open-air taxis. These are rather quaint, customized pickup trucks, with bench seating along the sides of the tray facing inwards under a canvas awning. Ricardo checked the numbers on the vehicles and led me to the third in the queue. He spoke to the driver and showed her a ticket. She was tall and athletic, with skin that gleamed golden in the sun's rays, sparkling amber eyes and lustrous blond hair which cascaded across broad shoulders. I was ready to believe the folklore that this island is home to the world's most beautiful women.<br>
<br>
She bid us welcome and announced herself as Catriona. Ricardo and I climbed into the back of the taxi. There was just enough room for us and the three couples already on board. We exchanged smiles. One of the women, aged in her middle thirties, was evidently comfortable with her nudity, although the way she pointed out the attractions to her husband when we were on the move made me think they were first-time visitors. Next to them were the two girls who had sat in front of me on the plane. Even without their punk-goth garb, their hair colors, perforations and pallid features proclaimed their lifestyle. And there was something else, a secret which cannot be kept on Palmira. On each girl, amidst the silken tufts between her thighs, I glimpsed the glint of a small gold ring piercing the rose-petal folds.<br>
<br>
I could not help but squirm when I took my place on the bench. The imitation leather was warm and sticky under my bare backside. I wished I'd had the foresight to get the packet of "wet wipes" out of my bag. It was too late now, but in any case the seat was spotless -- literally squeaky-clean.<br>
<br>
Our journey was slow through the downtown area, because pedestrians share the streets with the taxis (although no other vehicular traffic is allowed) and there seems to be no operational concept of right-of-way. So our buggy slowed from a crawl to a snail's pace in order to weave our way through the crowds. Whenever we swerved, and when we turned off the highway to head up into the hills, and as we climbed a gravelly, undulating road towards our hotel, I felt a delicious titillation as the skin of my bottom peeled away from the upholstery and clung again when I sank back down. It was weirdly erotic. My unconstrained breasts swayed to the rhythm, and while this was hardly a new sensation, its public display during the half-hour drive added to the thrill. None of us women could suppress the occasional gasp and sigh.<br>
<br>
While the other two males were understandably charmed by our aroused reactions, Ricardo either didn't notice or pretended not to. I was seated between him on my right and the other female passenger on my left. The man sitting directly across from me every so often let his gaze wander over my body, though our eyes never connected. He was tall, and his knees grazed against mine when the vehicle rocked sideways. We weren't packed in; but Ricardo's thighs touched mine whenever we lurched forward. The feel of the men's trousers against my bare skin tickled my senses. Even if I'd wanted to put my nudity out of mind, it was impossible.<br>
<br>
We drove eastwards straight through the town, which hugs the shorefront of Regatta Bay on the northern side of the island. RÃ©gate's western precincts merge into the Robina district, where the airport is located, and the Grandin "special administrative precinct" on the south-west coast. The eastern fringe diffuses into the forested ridge which forms the island's backbone. The parts are linked by two major thoroughfares. The Esplanade follows the curve of the bay and is lined with cafeterias, bars and nightclubs, travel agencies, vehicle hire operators, duty-free stores, souvenir shops and refreshment kiosks. The Boulevard runs further inland but roughly parallel. Along it are located department stores and specialty shops, offices, banks and hotels. Near the middle of town, the two avenues are connected by Patrick's Emporium, the historic marketplace.<br>
<br>
In contrast to the cool, quiet calm of the airport terminal, the town center was vibrant with exotic sights, sounds and smells. It has a distinctive French flavour -- leftovers, along with place names, from the early colonial era. The day was pleasantly warm and the salt air wafting off the waves was infused with aromas from the coffee shops and fragrances from the gardens. Tourists and locals mingled noisily, haggling, arguing, relaxing, loitering. It could have been any Caribbean resort, with an amorphous medley of males -- perspiring vacationers in Bermuda shorts and Hawaiian shirts, jocular merchants in decorative straw hats peddling knick-knacks, red-faced salesmen in white suits touting their trade, jaded tour leaders in khaki and olivine shepherding their groups and organizing rides.<br>
<br>
But then there were the women: visitors, vendors, agents, guides. They were shopping, sightseeing, plying the crowds outside the storefronts; hanging onto the arms of husbands, boyfriends, girlfriends; strolling or striding; wearing backpacks, carrying briefcases, toting shopping bags. Their skin was dark, light, pale, black, brown, pink. All were stark naked. Some wore hats and shoes, but in between was nothing but plain skin.<br>
<br>
After just a few minutes of observation I could distinguish local women from tourists. The former carry themselves with a self-assurance and self-possession that come with day-to-day experience. To any of these women, covering her body would be as awkwardly unfamiliar as out-in-the-open nudity was to me that day. Meanwhile, among the visitors it isn't hard to spot the new arrivals, although not always by complexions and tan lines. The newcomers' bodies will be slightly hunched, as if against the cold, even when it is sunny and hot. They cling to partners and avoid eye contact with all who pass by. Those having a few days' acquaintance with public nudity hold themselves with more ease and confidence, but they still stand out, albeit subtly, from the locals in the way they move and how they look about, not yet entirely accustomed to the extraordinary scenery, and less so to being part of it.<br>
<br>
We left the town and drove up a hill to the HÃ´tel AndromÃ¨de. Overlooking RÃ©gate with a superbly panoramic view of the bay, it is a genteel establishment, graceful in design, set amidst manicured lawns, carefully tended gardens and lush groves of palms and pines. It's comfortable rather than luxurious. Chips of fractured granite on the driveway crunched cheerily underfoot as we disembarked. On a marble plinth flanking the portico there is a bronze sculpture of the mythical Greek princess, chained naked to a rock and gazing toward the heavens awaiting her rescuer. The building's faux-Renaissance faÃ§ade might seem at first a little pretentious, but it is not overdone, and the interior's fine stucco decoration and period furniture do set the AndromÃ¨de above the norm.<br>
<br>
We thanked our chauffeuse and were met by a long-faced doorman who was a personification of the hotel, attired in a crimson uniform with wide lapels, gold epaulets and copious braid, befitting the old-world charm. He politely cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
"Excuse me, ladies." He pointed tactfully towards our feet.<br>
<br>
I was uncomprehending at first, until one of the other women exclaimed: "Good grief, this place really is posh!"<br>
<br>
We laughed and I took off my sandals. We approached the reception desk across a gleaming marble floor. In my bare feet, I tiptoed charily over the hard, cold surface.<br>
<br>
The young woman behind the counter had sleek brown skin and eyes like black diamonds. She wore her hair plaited in elaborate, beaded cornrows. She spoke in a dulcet voice with a melodic Caribbean cadence and a faint patrician overlay. A plaque on the desktop identified her as Regina. Like most Palmirene females I'd seen thus far, she was extremely attractive. So I do wonder if three centuries of nudity have given rise to a natural selection process that has made all the women so stunning. However, that may be an illusion. In reality, as I'd seen on the Esplanade, the women -- locals and visitors -- are not all beauty queens, nor by any means supermodel-slim or triathlete-trim. But I was finding out that once you get past the initial reticence, being so openly on display is a powerful and empowering expression of your womanhood. I have always believed that positive feelings about yourself radiate to everyone around you. (And I was soon to meet a woman who epitomizes that.)<br>
<br>
All of us standing at the desk were spellbound by this vision of unadorned splendor. I recovered and signed in, and was given my room key and some brochures. Regina reminded us of the hotel's amenities, including a saloon bar and dining room, a swimming pool and gymnasium; and she bade us to have an enjoyable stay.<br>
<br>
"I shall leave you here," Ricardo said. "I'll be back at nine tomorrow morning?"<br>
<br>
It took me a couple of seconds to realize he'd asked a question.<br>
<br>
"That's fine. See you then."<br>
<br>
There was no attendant to carry my luggage, which was just the one bag anyway. I took the stairs, and found my suite on the third floor. It was modest but comfortable, with a balcony that offered a splendid view of the bay. I took a quick shower, and it was a funny feeling to realize that once I'd toweled myself dry I was ready without further ado to go downstairs. But I couldn't resist scrutinizing myself in the full-length bedroom mirror. I performed a pirouette, arms outstretched, and was not displeased. I'm rather short. My lips are a tad too thin, my nose slightly crooked, my eyes a fraction too far apart, skin perhaps in need of better care. My hair is rather unkempt. (A shag cut demands discipline.) My breasts aren't large, my hips are narrow, my rear end is small; but I keep in shape, the contours are in the right places, and I have nice legs. I'm told I have a cute smile. My pubes bothered me, a little. Just a few wisps blurred the outlines of my crease. However, I'd read that in Palmirene custom pubic hair is like a wedding ring. Yet I decided that it was not a bad thing, at least for the time being.<br>
<br>
I went down to the bar. The place was almost empty, with a couple sitting at one of the half-dozen tables. The waitress waved her notepad to let me know that I'd been seen. She was streamlined and tawny-skinned. (I must say that I don't normally focus so much on women's physical appearance... at least I didn't, until Palmira.)<br>
<br>
I eased myself warily into one of the big lounge chairs. I now had in my purse my packet of towlettes, but decided I didn't need them. Yet I couldn't hold back another gasp. Unlike the taxi's upholstery, the leather was cool and slick against my back and bottom. I felt my heart begin to race and my chest start to heave, and it took a few moments to regain my composure. It was extraordinary how something as prosaic as sitting in an armchair could be such a new and exhilarating experience.<br>
<br>
The waitress now took my order for coffee, and while she was fetching it the couple came over and asked if they could join me. Feeling somewhat apprehensive -- sitting alone naked in a bar in a foreign country can do that to you -- and a little resentful that I'd been abandoned by Ricardo, I was happy to have company. Ted and Valerie are in their mid-to-late-forties. He is bespectacled and somewhat paunchy, with a florid face and a double chin. In his gaudy shirt and voluminous shorts, he was an endearing caricature of the jovial American tourist; and indeed he speaks with a broad Midwestern accent. She, on the other hand, is well-built and well-toned, with platinum-blond hair and a pleasant face, keen eyes and a breezy bearing. She is curvaceous with an all-over even tan. When she sat, I noticed that she pursed her lips as her flesh came into contact with the seat. It's obviously something you never really get used to.<br>
<br>
The waitress came back with my coffee. Ted inspected her body from one end to the other, his gaze lingering at the most interesting places along the way. He was utterly unabashed, and the young woman remained serene and gracious, completely relaxed at having her every nook and cranny examined so thoroughly.<br>
<br>
I had received only a cursory browse from Ted, but I wasn't offended. I could see he was showing restraint for the neophyte. Even so, I must have begun to blush, because Valerie leaned across and patted me on the knee. Then she did something that made me shiver. She gently pushed my knees apart, just a little. It might have come across as an invasively intimate thing to do, but I realized I had been clamping my thighs.<br>
<br>
"First time, sweetie?" she asked indulgently. "It takes some getting used to at first, but it's the best feeling in the world, you'll see."<br>
<br>
"This is our third trip." Ted explained. "We'll keep coming back, too. Can't get enough of it."<br>
<br>
Val slapped him playfully on his thigh, and her fingers caressed the cotton. "No, you can't."<br>
<br>
Their friendly enthusiasm was infectious. I started to relax, still somewhat tense but more at ease than I had been since flying out of Kingston.<br>
<br>
"First time we came..." Ted began.<br>
<br>
"I hid in our room for two days," Valerie continued. "By the time we left, I had almost forgotten what it was like to wear clothes. You get so into it." She took a sip of her cocktail. "There are basically two types of men here, and believe it or not they don't divide cleanly into locals and visitors. Some will look at you out of the corners of their eyes. They're self-conscious about it, but they can't keep their peepers off you. The other kind will stand there and take a good long look, and when they're satisfied they go about their business."<br>
<br>
"A naked woman is as natural and glorious as a sunrise," Ted cut in.<br>
<br>
"He gets poetic around pretty girls," Valerie scoffed, good-naturedly, "but he's right, you know. Take some advice. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed. If they're looking at you, it's because they like what they see. Treat it as a compliment. So don't try to hide anything. Let them see what you have."<br>
<br>
She paused, letting her words sink in.<br>
<br>
"God made the man first..." Ted said.<br>
<br>
"... and left the best for last," Val went on. "But the island has lots of things to offer besides the obvious. Some very good restaurants. Wonderful scenery, especially when you get out of the town. Lots to do. Snorkeling and scuba diving -- that's our hobby. One last piece of advice though. Sun protection is a must, particularly on your pussy."<br>
<br>
I drew in a breath.<br>
<br>
"You don't want him sticking it in there when you've got a bad case of sunburn." She paused. "There is a him?"<br>
<br>
I replied with a non-committal smile.<br>
<br>
Ted and Val are an interesting couple; and I have no doubt who, back home, wears the pants.<br>
<br>
After some time and a single glass of wine, I managed to extricate myself from the TV show. I admired their forthright and comfortable manner, but they were the sort of pair whose joie de vivre will quickly exhaust you. Their natural habitat is the large gathering where they can pass, or be passed, from one audience to the next.<br>
<br>
I retired to my room for a nap but couldn't sleep so I caught up on some reading. When it was time for dinner, I discovered that getting ready to go out for the evening is much simpler when you have literally nothing to wear. I decided to follow the lead of Palmirene women and eschew make-up. (They take the natural beauty of the female body seriously.)<br>
<br>
I opted for the elevator because it was directly across the corridor from my room. I immediately lamented my laziness, because the car was crowded, with four women including the goth-punk pair and two men. We weren't exactly pressed together, but our bodies touched as the car wobbled downwards. It was an antiquated lift which rattled and groaned and travelled very slowly. I happened to be wedged sideways between the two males. The shirts and trousers of the man behind me brushed against my bare back and bottom, those in front of me against my breasts. As in the taxi, it was a peculiar feeling. The fabric tickled but also teased. The descent seemed to take forever. I only just managed to stifle a moan.<br>
<br>
The restaurant was small but fancy, with pristine white tablecloths, starched napkins, silver candleholders -- all the accoutrements of a high-class establishment. The serving staff consisted of a waiter and three waitresses. He wore an elegant uniform of black pants and ruffled white shirt, with a spruce-green tie and silver-trimmed vest. The girls were, of course, dÃ©shabillÃ© head to foot. They were marshalled by a pint-sized, intense-looking woman, the maÃ®tresse d'hÃ´tel and sommeliÃ¨re, whose only accessory to what nature and a vigorous daily workout had endowed upon her was a gold filigree band encircling her throat.<br>
<br>
It was with slightly guilty relief that I scanned the room and saw no sign of Ted and Valerie. Yet I was fretting that I hadn't booked a table because the place was filling up. So I was about to head for the bar to order a counter meal when the goth-punk girls suggested I join them. Perhaps they were just being nice, but Emily and Caitlyn -- Ems and Cat, they called each other -- turned out to be delightful company, erudite and inquisitive; and I felt a tinge of remorse at having judged these winsome booklets by their offbeat covers. They are both petite and pretty, although I'm not fond of piercings, particularly green-haired Caitlyn's nipple rings. I was a little puzzled that neither had tattoos, but purple-topped Emily gave an explanation that made me smile.<br>
<br>
"This is just a phase, you know."<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure if she was being serious, because she had a wry sense of humor. Caitlyn was more frivolous; and when a waiter approached she twisted round in her seat to flirtatiously present him with a full view of her body. Yet the way the girls gazed every so often into each other's eyes, I had the impression they were lovers. They seemed genuinely interested in my archaeological work, and I in turn was curious about their motive for visiting Palmira. To get in touch with their femininity, was Emily's enigmatic reply.<br>
<br>
I wish I could have spent more time getting to know them. They were setting off in the morning with a hiking party.<br>
<br>
"Use plenty of sunblock," I advised.
        </div>





        <div id="chapter3" class="chapter-content">I awoke to a chorus of songbirds. Sunrise was just getting started behind the ridge at the rear of the hotel. Regatta Bay was still shrouded in darkness; scattered clouds glowed pink and orange in the indigo sky; a sallow near-full moon was sinking in the west. I imbibed the clean, crisp, salty air. I love that lonely, tranquil time when the night's reign is ending but the day is not yet upon you.<br>
<br>
I heard a noise coming from below. On the lawn, the group with Emily and Caitlyn was getting ready to set off on their trek. In the half-light it was a wonderfully eccentric tableau. There were around twenty people. The males wore the standard hiking apparel. The females were (naturally) nude between their broad-brimmed hats and sturdy hiking boots; their bodies gleamed with sunscreen and their faces were streaked with zinc cream. Protected from the solar rays, the women were defenseless against a brisk breeze blowing off the bay. They were stamping their feet and swinging their arms. One of them uttered a reedy cheer when it was time to go. As they moved out, bare derriÃ¨res wiggled beneath laden backpacks.<br>
<br>
The wind was picking up and beginning to bite, so I retreated inside to make a quick breakfast of tea and toast in the kitchenette; but as I was about to sit down I heard voices from the direction of the balcony. For a second or two I was bewildered, and a little chilled. Then I reproached myself because the talking was obviously on the adjacent deck. I tried to be discreet, peeking through the latticework screen, but was greeted with a merry "Good morning!" in German accents from a man and a woman. I saw, to my shock, that both were naked, sitting in deck chairs sipping coffee, and apparently not minding the nip in the air.<br>
<br>
They invited me to come over, and it was their turn to be startled when I said "Don't get up" and scrambled over the balustrade and around the partition. We were three storeys above the ground. Apparently Palmira has boosted my bravado.<br>
<br>
There were no extra chairs so I leaned against the railing. Dieter studied my body so thoroughly that I wondered if an erection was coming. But he and Gabrielle are devotees of the FreikÃ¶rperkultur, free body culture, and as an experienced naturist he knew how to control his responses. In the world beyond Palmira, nudism and naturism (there is a subtle difference) impose a form of equality on its practitioners. They reject the social conditioning which makes us regard clothing as a way of separating ourselves from nature, as a means for self-expression and a symbol of status. As Mark Twain wrote: "Strip the human race absolutely naked and it would be a real democracy." However, whatever they do in the privacy of their suite and balcony, when Dieter and Gabrielle go out he wears clothes while she does not and is not permitted to. Yet they embrace la diffÃ©rence. They take pleasure in it.<br>
<br>
And although adherents of the free body culture generally deny that eroticism has any part in their lifestyle, the carnal connotations of what's called "cmnf" -- clothed male naked female (although I think "nfcm" puts the emphasis where it belongs) -- are unmistakable.<br>
<br>
The most celebrated depiction of "cmnf" is Le DÃ©jeuner sur l'Herbe (Luncheon on the Grass), the painting by Ãdouard Manet. I have loved it since I was a teenager when I kept a poster copy on my bedroom wall. It shows two fully clothed gentlemen enjoying the eponymous picnic with a naked woman. The figures are in languid poses. She gazes confidently out of the frame towards the viewer, expressing no embarrassment, let alone shame. Despite the one-sided nudity, indeed by virtue of it, she has emancipated herself to be on equal terms with her male companions.<br>
<br>
Yet there is sexual tension and a power imbalance intrinsic to Palmira's nude-law culture, because not only is just one sex is naked, but that sex must be naked. And this dynamic appears to favour the male. But that's an illusion, because the women espouse it as much as if not more than their menfolk. Meanwhile, outsiders like myself have chosen freely to come to Palmira, to be subject to the nude law. Ours has been an empowered choice.<br>
<br>
So having done my customary overanalyzing, I left Dieter and Gabrielle. I decided to take a stroll around the hotel grounds and to the shoreline a few hundred paces down the hill. I waited until I was outdoors before putting on my hiking shoes, and won a nod of approval from the doorman as I tiptoed across the ice-cold tiles. My footwear, cap and a layer of sunscreen were all I had on. The day was already heating up, but it was a pleasant walk.<br>
<br>
On the spur of the moment I resolved to walk all the way to the centre of the town. I calculated it to be, at a brisk pace, about twenty minutes away. I would be back in plenty of time for my rendezvous with Ricardo. The road is steep at the beginning but levels out when you reach the coastal flats about half-way. There the Esplanade starts its run along the shoreline. On your way down, you sense the history of this island as you pass remnants of the serriform rows of fortifications that once snaked up the hillside towards the stronghold overlooking the harbor.<br>
<br>
RÃ©gate's population is about three thousand, twice that in the entire conurbation of RÃ©gate, Robina, Grandin and proximate villages. The business and entertainment heart is bustling, noisy, in places gaudy but rarely tacky or seedy. The Palmirenes disdain the high-rise development which has tarnished the glamour of other resort communities, but there are nevertheless unmistakable signs of progress and prosperity. The weatherboard houses are modest but well-maintained. The overall tone is affluent but egalitarian, combining colonial-style elegance with modern glass and steel. There are no ornate villas, gargantuan mansions or opulent hotels.<br>
<br>
The pedestrian traffic was relatively light until I reached Patrick's Emporium. Nobody seems to know who the eponymous Patrick was, but this has been the marketplace since when piracy and slave-trading were the mainstays of the Palmirene economy. The island's early history is apotheosized here in larger-than-life statues carved from coral aggregate concrete and placed on ornately decorated plinths. Staring, or glaring, at each other from opposite sides of the square are two men, the founding fathers of modern Palmira from the buccaneering era, Christophe Peyrefitte and Jonathan Rogers. Their hostile expressions can be accounted for by the fact that the former was murdered by the latter. Nearby but closer to the waterfront are two female figures, both naked of course but rendered on the same scale as the men. One is of an indigenous American, probably of the Arawak people, tilling the ground with a long-handled hoe. Though not the first population to settle on the island, the Arawaks introduced a sophisticated culture. The other monument is a European woman flanked by two males, sailors in old-timey garb, standing at the helm of a ship. The latter are portrayed slightly smaller than the woman, to emphasize her pre-eminence. She is Ãlisabeth Peyrefitte, the founder's granddaughter, who commanded her own merchantman in the mid-seventeenth century. These effigies represent the historical Palmirene economy and society before, during and after the age of piracy.<br>
<br>
In the Emporium fish, fruit, meats and vegetables are sold, but the liveliest activity is focused on tourism, with a veritable maze of trinket stalls and dozens of roaming vendors. There are, surprisingly, women's clothing outlets, selling everything from bikinis to ball gowns. Because it's at the heart of everything, people were coming and going, in all directions, hunting for early-morning bargains, seeking breakfast or heading off to work. Some were leaving the beach, the only public place where male and female bodies approach any degree of symmetry. Yet even on the strand the difference remains. You are warned in the literature, and by shorefront signage, that male nudity is prohibited. Indeed, Palmirenes are rather prudish about this. Exiting the beach, men are expected to at least put on a shirt, and trousers or shorts are de rigueur downtown.<br>
<br>
I wandered aimlessly for a while, taking in the sights. I was particularly interested in people's daily lives; and I found exemplars in a couple sitting in a sidewalk cafÃ© having coffee and croissants. From the evidence of their laptops and folios, I deduced that they worked for one of the many banks and law firms based on the Boulevard. (Offshore banking is a growing, albeit somewhat controversial, source of income, rivalling tourism in importance to the local economy.) The man was dressed in an expensive tropical-style business suit. Though trying not to eavesdrop, I overheard snippets of their conversation. The woman spoke with an English accent but her body was evenly tanned. Extravagant red curls swept over her shoulders but stayed clear of her breasts. I pictured her as a bright, ambitious junior executive making a name for herself in the City of London, and learning that she had been transferred to a branch office in the sunny West Indies. ("The law says I must what?") As she and her partner rose to leave, she turned away from me and I saw that the crisscross pattern of the woven wicker seat was imprinted in faint reddish weals on her buttocks.<br>
<br>
The sight of naked flesh was no longer a novelty; but on returning to the Esplanade I was reminded of the exotic nature of this society. I passed two police constables on patrol, a man and a woman. His uniform was a khaki shirt, slate-blue trousers and a broad-brimmed hat with a red band. Hers consisted of thin red ribbons around her upper arms. She wore shoes at one end of her and a sun visor at the other with nothing else but a narrow belt, from which were slung a baton and a radio. They paused to assist a couple who appeared lost. The man wanted to take a photo and they affably obliged. Farther along the street, two girls were eating ice-cream. Lush blond locks splayed across the chest of one. The policewoman amiably instructed the girl to tie back her hair. Nothing must conceal what nature has bestowed.<br>
<br>
It was time to return to the hotel to meet Ricardo. It was getting hot and I was walking uphill, so the sea breeze provided a welcome respite.<br>
<br>
By now I was coming to terms with my nudity. I found myself striding with confidence through the crowds, not flaunting myself but enjoying what attention I received. Valerie was right. People look at you. It's why the nude law exists and it's why tourists come here. But in one respect it's easier for the males. Nudity exposes not just women's bodies, but our thoughts and feelings as well. Those who pretend they're not affected are betrayed by flushed faces but as well by raised nipples. You cannot, even for a moment, escape, hide or forget what you are and what you're not.<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br></p>
I was back at the hotel in plenty of time for a shower. I switched my shoes for sandals, but carried them as I went down to the bar for a coffee while waiting for Ricardo. He turned up just as Ted and Valerie came in. They smiled and winked, but moved on. Ricardo took me out to a small, open-sided vehicle something like a golf buggy. There are a lot of these on Palmira. To reduce urban traffic congestion, restrictions are placed on the size and power of private motor vehicles. Where and whenever possible people use the taxis, which is why Ricardo had arranged for one to take us to my hotel from the airport.<br>
<br>
It's easy to see why the Palmirenes are so protective of their paradise. It is one of the most picturesque and fragile environments in the West Indies. Most of the people reside in the three municipalities along a small stretch of coast. The rest live in scattered communities across the island's thirty-four square kilometers (thirteen square miles). Nestled between the harbor and hills, RÃ©gate is the seat of government, chief port and commercial centre. Grandin is a dormitory town. Between them, Robina is the transport hub, built around the airport which services the island with a direct daily connection to Jamaica and regular flights from most parts of the Caribbean. The other major population centre is on Frigate Island, with a few hundred permanent inhabitants and several hotels. It lies north-east of the "mainland", accessible via inter-island ferry and water-taxi.<br>
<br>
Having no rivers or natural lakes, Palmira is completely reliant on rainfall storage for its water supply, so farming is difficult and most foodstuffs must be imported. Some locals still engage in fishing and boat-building. Banking is the nascent source of revenue but is heavily regulated to avoid the scandals which have tainted that sector elsewhere. Palmira issues its own currency, and the local banks exchange money for an admirably small fee. Unemployment is virtually non-existent and the people enjoy one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, yet most abjure extravagant and ostentatious lifestyles.<br>
<br>
The main industry is, obviously, tourism. In addition to the idyllic tropical setting and superb scenery, its colourful history and unique way of life have made this once sleepy backwater a popular destination for adventurers and romantics, thrill-seekers and pleasure-seekers. With most of the workforce engaged in tourist-related activities and more than half foreign-born, it is not surprising that Palmira has a relatively young population. Furthermore, the sex ratio is lopsided, with 140 females for every 100 males. No other country in the world comes close to this figure; and it is the nude law which is mainly responsible. Women are easily seduced by this island. We come here to work and to play.<br>
<br>
The trickle of tourists which started early in the twentieth century had become a steady flow by the 1970s. Female nudity became an attraction for jaded jetsetters bored with the topless beaches of Saint-Tropez and the fashionable hideaways of Montego Bay and Mustique. Articles in tourist magazines like the one that had attracted my attention, and in publications such as National Geographic, Time-Life, Newsweek and (naturally) Playboy highlighted the attractions of "gleaming golden sands, shimmering azure waters, dazzling cerulean skies and glistening naked female bodies" for a receptive audience. "Don't bother packing much besides your toothbrush," one well-known travel journalist advised her feminine readership.<br>
<br>
The legacy of the egalitarian buccaneer culture of old Palmira and the cosmopolitan influences of tourism and immigration have made this community a model of social harmony and racial equality in a troubled and turbulent part of the world. Political, social and economic upheavals elsewhere in the Caribbean have had little impact. The winds of change sweeping across the region have been a benign breeze in Palmira.<br>
<br>
How much of the island's prosperity, stability and tranquility can be attributed to the nude law may be a matter for debate; but the Palmirene people think they know. They have a saying. "When all women are naked, all men know they are brothers."</div>
        <div id="chapter4" class="chapter-content">Ricardo and I drove to the Palmira College postgraduate campus in RÃ©gate. (The undergraduate school is located in Grandin.) It's a salubrious setting, a cluster of wooden-frame buildings nestled amongst the trees behind a forested hill not far from the beach. When we arrived there were a few people moving about, and this essentially random sample confirmed that about seventy percent of staff and students are female. The sight of their naked bodies should by now have been almost banal; but it was nevertheless a little bit strange to see the nude law operating in this place of higher learning.<br><br>Ricardo ushered me to the Department of Archaeology and Ethnology. Professor Hayden is also the dean of the postgrad school, which is an indication of how seriously the Palmirenes take their historical and cultural heritage. She was accompanied by two of her students. Stephanie and Brandon are a Californian and a New Zealander. They had been living on Palmira for just over a year, and helped Rebecca in getting me au courant with progress on the dig sites.<br><br>The principal excavation, where I would be working, is at CimarrÃ³n Bay on the east coast. A secondary dig at Hamilton Bay on the south coast has yielded significant finds. Discoveries have also been made at Grandin Bay in the south-west, but investigations there have been hampered by urban development. However, that site is used by the College for teaching purposes. There are smaller spots scattered all over the island. Because they have such a strong sense of their past, the Palmirene people take a keen interest in local archaeology. The popular interest is in colonial history, in particular the pirate heritage, but the government promotes pre-Columbian studies. A major focus has been on historical and cultural links with other parts of the Caribbean, from which half the population originates.<br><br>While the archaeology was the main topic, every so often our discussion came round to the nude law. I wanted to know how it affected the on-site personnel and the work. As the only one of us wearing clothes, Brandon kept out of the conversation at first, although I was interested in the male perspective. I described my feelings and perceptions, and the women assured me that these were typical for a newcomer. This was important because most of the volunteer diggers come from overseas and, like the tourists, the majority are female. My responsibilities as a site supervisor would include their health, safety and welfare. When preparing for a project in the field you have to be aware of, and be able to cope with, social and even sexual dynamics. In addition, for cultural anthropologists like myself the dig site not just provides a window on the past, it can be a laboratory for contemporary studies as well.<br><br>Rebecca emphasized that her nudity has no adverse impact on her authority as a senior academic. In fact, she comes across as very charismatic, a natural leader au naturel. Her students idolize her, and as she spoke Brandon appeared smitten. She's a very attractive woman, and being naked understandably adds to the appeal. She was obviously aware of his infatuation, but (as I've since come to appreciate) women who deal with male underlings here on Palmira take this grown-up puppy love in their stride.<br><br>Back in Australia, while completing my doctoral dissertation I taught undergraduate classes, and encountered the occasional crush. Even in academia you cannot entirely avoid the "You're a woman, I'm a man" attitude from some of the guys; but it's kept suppressed. On Palmira, however, it's amplified because of the one-sided nature of nudity. Professional relationships between the sexes will not be asexual. You cannot sublimate the difference between male and female. And because she is not permitted to cover her body, the sexual tension between Rebecca and Brandon, between naked teacher and clothed student, is heightened even more.<br><br>These thoughts were not expressed in as many words, but it seemed clear to me.<br><br>Stephanie lightened the mood by revealing that whenever she goes home to California she finds it a weird and unsettling experience to be wearing clothes. Brandon then told us that he was surprised at first at how nonchalant the local men are about nudity and the local women about its compulsory nature. I thought he would raise some sort of response from Rebecca and Stephanie when he claimed that for outlanders it's the males who find it harder to adjust, and not merely in not knowing where to look and how long to look, and the difference between a glance, a stare, an ogle and a leer. While it's most young men's fantasy to be surrounded by naked women all the time, males can be shy too. And there's such a thing as sensory overload.<br><br>The women listened to Brandon's views in silence, nodding and smiling. I found them enlightening.<br><br>As our meeting ended, Ricardo returned with disappointing news. My scheduled inspection of the Palmira Museum would have to be postponed. In Marcia's absence the deputy director, Harlan Villanueva, was assigned to be my host. However, he had been called to a conference with members of the government at Parliament House. But there would be plenty of occasions to visit, and the alternative was more than enough compensation. I was invited to join Harlan. It was an opportunity not to pass up.<br><br>Palmirenes are proud of the fact that their island, the world's fourth smallest independent state, has one of the oldest continuously operating parliaments. Although self-government was achieved in 1968, and full independence from Britain in 1974, the Legislative Assembly has convened in one form or another for more than two centuries. It currently has seventeen members elected for a three-year term. There are no formal political parties, and while the Members tend to vote in two blocs, conservative and progressive, there's little (from what I can tell) which sets them apart. Polling day is treated as a festive occasion, and since MPs are chosen by proportional representation, elections are not winner-take-all contests. Compromise and consensus are the by-words of Palmirene politics.<br><br>It must be said, however, that sexual equality was rather slow in coming to Palmira. Women did not achieve the right to vote until 1973, and were not enfranchised on an equal basis with men until as recently as 1990. But how things have changed! In 2009, Palmirenes elected a female parliamentary majority; and today this small but enterprising island state has a woman Governor, Chief Minister and Chief Justice. And that is at least partially due to the nude law. Women have taken control of their own lives and, yes, their own bodies.<br><br>After a coffee shop lunch, Ricardo and I drove on to Parliament House. I told him not to wait for me, that I would walk back to the hotel. Located on the north-eastern outskirts of RÃ©gate, the seat of government is an unprepossessing structure, in keeping with the Palmirenes' easygoing approach to officialdom. Harlan was waiting patiently outside. He greeted me with a slight Spanish accent. He's corpulent but eye-catching, with an Einstein hairdo, and he mirrors the locals' breezy style by wearing brightly coloured safari suits (unironically). He writes a very entertaining monthly newsletter for the museum that has become required reading for scholars of the island's history.<br><br>Harlan closely scrutinized my body as I approached, and I recalled Valerie's advice that this should be regarded as a compliment. To gain admission to the public gallery he and I simply walked up to the entrance, greeted the solitary guard (a genial old gentleman) and took the stairs to the second floor. The legislature was in session, and the people's delegates were engaged in a debate about fisheries. The exchanges were polite and relaxed. A couple of interjections drew laughs on both sides of the chamber. The Chief Minister, Jennifer Hibbert, was speaking. She is a striking woman, full-figured but graceful, and in common with most Palmirenes is of mixed racial heritage.<br><br>After twenty-four hours on the island, I would have been surprised if the ten female MPs had not been naked. The cozy concordance of their warm skin tones and the cool green leather of the seats of power they occupied seemed symbolic of the temperate nature of Palmirene politics, but also of the vivid contrast which is the essence of the local culture. And perhaps because the air conditioning appeared to be out of order, their male colleagues in coats and ties looked much less at ease.<br><br>Thinking about this, I recalled a passage written by Jennifer Hibbert for the traveler's guide about the nude law.<br><br>"Striving for equality does not mean aspiring to sameness. Here we value equity -- ensuring justice and fairness, allowing every person the appropriate opportunities to lead a full, healthy life. To this end, we as a society must understand and acknowledge our differences; but when we have achieved equity we can celebrate those differences. So equal rights do not mean exactly the same treatment or obligations under the laws. And in this respect, here in Palmira men and women are definitely not equal. The beauty of the female body is esteemed above all else. As women, it is our right and our privilege to honor what nature has given us, by never hiding it away."<br><br>I wanted to meet this woman, but as soon as the Assembly adjourned she went off to some engagement. Still, I got to sit in on Harlan's conference with several government Ministers. One of these, Meredith Hewes, was the woman who'd been on my flight. Like the Parliament, most of the Cabinet is female. The meeting was comfortably casual, everyone addressing each other by their first names. The discussion was about promoting the island as a high-end travel destination with a focus on historical themes, so my input was invited. For environmental and logistical reasons limits have had to be placed on the intake of visitors, in particular from cruise ship stopovers. At first it bothered me that they seemed so snobbish about up-scale tourism; but the hard fact is that Palmira needs restrictions for the sake of the environment, without contracting the economy. In any case, I think I made an impression, reminding everyone that the island's pre-Columbian archaeology was just as significant as that of the colonial period.<br><br>My walk back to the HÃ´tel AndromÃ¨de, along a circuitous route, gave me time to think. I mused about how my life and outlook had changed in such a short time. I had just sat in on a meeting with five bona fide government Ministers. Three of them were stark naked and it was mundane. And here I was, also without a stitch on my body, tramping nonchalantly up the hill.<br><br>I thought again of Mark Twain's words. He also wrote: "Without his clothes a man would be nothing at all. There is no power without clothes." Perhaps he was right, but what about the women? It might very well be claimed that it's they who today embody the classless, democratic spirit of Palmira's buccaneer heritage. In nudity there are no artificial distinctions. Certainly there is individuality and thus diversity, in size and skin tone for instance. But as women we all have breasts and vaginas, and without the accoutrements of clothing it is this commonality which stands out, not the superficial differences.<br><br>That being said, you can't ignore the asymmetry between men and women embodied in the nude law. It's one of the ironies of this weird and wonderful place. Because women have achieved social and economic equality, and are represented in every sphere of cultural, commercial and political life, their naked bodies, deprived of clothing by the law of the land, are ubiquitous. You'd be hard-pressed to describe any aspect of Palmirene society without reference to or a comment on this singular attribute. And that's what makes Palmira special. All women are naked and only women are naked, we are naked all the time and we must be naked. Our nudity is an expression and a celebration of our womanhood. As I've mentioned, one doesn't have to be a supermodel, a glamorous starlet or a fine-tuned athlete to experience the joy of nudity, just be female.<br><br>It was a good thing that the walk was not too far. I tend to get lost in my thoughts and then lost physically. It was late in the afternoon when I reached the hotel. I freshened up and went down to the lounge bar. I was wondering what to do with my evening; but just as I took my seat, Regina the receptionist came in. She chatted briefly with the bar attendant, saw me and asked if she might sit with me awhile. I happily agreed and we ordered coffee. She impressed me by knowing about my archaeological work. In a relatively small community it was predictable that she knew the general details of my visit; but she actually cited a couple of my academic papers. From her refined accent I had already determined that she'd been educated in England, and now learned that her parents are the hotel's proprietors. The family are members of Palmira's Ã©lite class, who still have an influence in how things are run.<br><br>It disappointed me a little that such a compact, compatible population might be socially stratified, but the reassuring reality is that class divisions are blurred to the point of invisibility. (Most Palmirene natives claim to be descended from the pirate-age pioneers; but that seems unlikely.) No one flaunts their wealth or status, and the elegant, alluring Regina, working at the reception desk, personifies this egalitarian spirit. In fact her brother, who's two or three years younger, was the bar attendant that evening. He brought our coffees and Regina introduced us. He looked me over, something I was rapidly getting used to and which he did almost as a reflex. Yet I couldn't help but wonder how he must feel about other men inspecting his naked sister. They have been conditioned to the fact that he wears clothes and she doesn't; but still...<br><br>I decided against revealing my family's Palmirene heritage. My kin and Regina's are (I'd heard) traditional rivals. Anyway, she was much more interested in hearing about the ancient history of her island. I invited her to be a part of one of the excavations I'd be overseeing, and she appeared genuinely delighted (although from the looks of her immaculate hands and unblemished body, she has not spent much time digging under a hot sun). Then she apologized because "Duty calls," and as she rose to depart she grinned.<br><br>"I leave you in capable hands," she said.<br><br>Ted's profligate shirt and Valerie's magnificent breasts loomed over me.</div>
        <div id="chapter5" class="chapter-content">Ted called for drinks and I ordered a half-glass of chardonnay. Valerie announced that they were going downtown for dinner and insisted that I come along; and as soon as I capitulated she raised her hand and waved eagerly towards the lounge entrance. Caroline and Fin (short for Finlay) came to join us. They are Scottish, spend most of their vacation time in the Caribbean, and met the Americans while scuba-diving. They are aged in their mid-thirties. He is suntanned and stocky, with what one would describe as movie-star chiselled good looks. She is fair-skinned and slightly built, with delicate features and strawberry blond hair. This was their first trip to Palmira and they had been drawn by another of the island's great attractions, its glorious coral reefs.<br><br>I left my wine and went back upstairs to fetch my purse and shoes. When I returned two more of Ted and Valerie's recruits had arrived. I couldn't tell if they were a romantic couple. They are French, both brunette and very pretty. Ãlise is slightly taller; her body's contours are angular, giving an impression of brittle fragility, like fine crystal; her eyes shine like blue sapphires. AdÃ¨le's curves are more voluptuous; her eyes glitter midnight blue above exquisite cheekbones.<br><br>Caroline and Fin didn't say much but seemed intelligent. Ãlise also said little, but when she did she displayed a whimsical wisdom. AdÃ¨le is outgoing and excitable. When she gets feisty her voice becomes adorably high-pitched, and her breasts begin to undulate, in a manner that caught the rapt attention of the two men. Although this was their first trip to Palmira, she demonstrated an encyclopaedic knowledge of the island's history and culture.<br><br>A final couple showed up to complete our party just as we were getting ready to leave. Ted and Val had certainly been busy with their social networking, and told me that I was in for a pleasant surprise. When introduced, Rob and Sarah responded in Australian accents. I'm not sure why meeting fellow Aussies was supposed to give me such joy, but they turned out to be quirkily charming, entertaining us with almost constant good-natured bickering. Indeed, they are an eccentric match. He's tall and easy-going; she's energetic and somewhat bossy, despite her diminutive stature, willowy figure and squeaky voice. Her peach complexion, animated sky-blue eyes and pixie-cut blond hair round out the impish impression. In fact I'd already noticed Sarah when I returned to the hotel that afternoon. She was at the front desk facing away from me, and with her pocket-sized figure and short hair, if she'd been wearing clothes she might have been mistaken for a boy. She and her husband were in their third and last week of their first-time visit to Palmira.<br><br>Our expedition was now at all-systems-go. The men wore jackets so I deduced that we were heading to somewhere swank. In fact, I felt more underdressed than ever, because the other women had on earrings, necklaces and, in Sarah's case, a gorgeous crimson ribbon choker with a miniature white rose. Valerie and the two French girls, in addition to applying lipstick and cheek blush, had rouged their nipples. So much for the "natural" beauty of our bodies! But I didn't fret. Nor did I feel like a ninth wheel. Although none of the others were as effusive and ebullient as Val and Ted, all of my new friends were excellent company.<br><br>We ladies were still clutching our shoes as we crossed the driveway to one of the open-air taxis, which was parked at the end of the cul-de-sac. (In the driver's seat was Catriona, the chauffeuse from the previous day, who was even more stunning illuminated by the rays of the setting sun.) The sharp granite chips bit into our bare feet so we trod lightly. A breeze was blowing off the bay and my skin tingled.<br><br>As we set off down the hill, Rob had volunteered to sit up front with Catriona. The rest of us were packed in tightly. However, the snug fit proved propitious because of the chill; and as we climbed in six of us were stippled with goosebumps. So much for the tropics!<br><br>I recalled one time when some friends and I were on a girls' night out and wore very skimpy dresses, in winter. There are times, and especially it comes to clothing choices, when males have more sense. But our philosophy was "When you look hot you don't mind the cold." Words to live by, or words to regret?<br><br>The other two men, Ted and Fin, sat at the ends of the benches, most exposed to the cool air; and our huddled bodies provided mutual warmth. I was seated between Caroline and Sarah, and though I am rather drearily "straight" it was hard not to be a little aroused by the touch of their naked flesh pressed against mine. Nevertheless, by the time we'd reached the coastal flats and then the shelter of the buildings lining the seaward side of the Esplanade, we females were a bit cranky. When Rob couldn't resist praising the brittle night air, Sarah thumped him in the chest. His grin slumped into a grimace. She may be tiny, but she packs a hefty punch.<br><br>We put on our shoes to walk the final distance. The street blazed with lights and roared with noise from the bars, clubs and discotheques. Although they are open day and night, it is after sunset and on till dawn that they come alive -- loud and crowded, bursting with that quintessentially Caribbean blend of glitz and glamour, vitality and vulgarity. Val and Ted guided us through the throng towards their favourite restaurant. As we entered, all of us women took off our shoes once more. It wasn't required, as it was in the hotel; but it was an automatic gesture; and I have to say that being barefoot embellishes the look and feel of complete denudation.<br><br>The maÃ®tre d' introduced himself as Antoine and showed us to a circular table. We were seated so that each man was between two women. Ted co-opted the arrangements to make sure that partners weren't sitting together. I had Rob on my left and Ãlise on my right.<br><br>"Will the ladies be dining sans vue?" Antoine inquired.<br><br>"Blindfolded," AdÃ¨le whispered, although I think we all understood.<br><br>Ted nodded without consulting us. I presume the question was rhetorical, since all female customers in the place, from what I could see, wore blindfolds. A waitress promptly appeared bearing a platter. (Her pubic hair was eye-catching, dyed carnation ink and trimmed in a heart shape.) On the tray was a stack of black satin sashes.<br><br>Rob asked "May I?"<br><br>"Please," I replied.<br><br>As he wrapped the satin about my head, he did so in a leisurely fashion, as if to let me feel the darkness as it descended. Drawing back my hair, his fingers brushed over my bare shoulders, perhaps deliberately, and I flinched. The man seemed oblivious, or he didn't care.<br><br>I had already enjoyed the adventure of dining dans le noir. I love the anticipation of each bite or sip, the momentary puzzlement and the sudden awareness of how heightened your senses have become as the loss of one stimulates the others. It titillates the taste buds and enriches your receptivity to aromas and textures as well as flavours. However, Ted had arranged for an extra treat that evening. As I sat sightless in silence, I heard odd little sounds around me -- shuffling, a murmur, a chuckle. It took me a moment to realize that the three men were communicating wordlessly with each other. (This went on throughout the meal, to keep us women in the dark metaphorically as well as literally.) Then Rob tapped me lightly on the shoulder and whispered that I should put my hands behind my back. As I did so he gently grasped my wrists, crossed them and looped what felt like silk ribbon around and between them. Once he'd tied the knot I found my arms securely pinioned, though not so much as to put stress on my arms or chest. Thus rendered helpless, I had to be hand-fed my food and wine.<br><br>The menu was superb. We started with an ambrosial seafood cocktail, moved on to a heavenly main course of duck in brandy sauce with truffles and wild mushrooms, and finished with a voluptuous dessert, dulce de coco -- pineapple and sweet potato smothered in coconut cream. I only found out the exact menu afterwards, but it was fun to guess and I mostly got it right.<br><br>Being bound and blindfolded, as well as nude, adds immensely to the culinary experience. Having ceded control to your partner, you must depend on him completely. You cannot be sure of what is going into your mouth when the fork or spoon hovers tantalizingly under your nose and nudges alluringly against your lips. The food then slowly reveals itself on your palate. Every morsel becomes an epicurean exploration, every sip of wine an intoxicating adventure. Each man attended to the women flanking him. Because Rob had his hands full doing double duty, and was also eating, I had time to savour each mouthful and anticipate the next. All of this adds to your pleasure. Your appreciation of the meal is enhanced. The simple act of dining is elevated to a skill, an art form and, yes, a sexual sensation. Still, it can get messy. When my blindfold eventually came off, I discovered a streak of tangy relish garnishing my right breast and a splotch of sweet cream decorating the left.<br><br>When we weren't concentrating fully on the meal, the repartee was lively and enlightening. Our bonds and blindfolds didn't inhibit us women any more than being naked. Undoubtedly a couple of glasses of wine contributed to the ambiance. And there was no particular reason why only females should dine sans vue et en bondage, except that you already feel the piquancy of your nudity, so it's like a triple dose of sensory arousal.<br><br>Next to me, Ãlise was taken care of by Fin, and every so often I heard her gasp and giggle. Apart from that she seemed more reserved, hardly engaging in the cross-table conversation. She's by nature taciturn but also, I think, she was turned on by our experience and enjoying it quietly. Valerie, on the other hand, also fed by Fin, was lusty, vocal and funny. Sarah and AdÃ¨le were being serviced by Ted, and given the sounds they were making that word "service" is a deliberate double entendre. At the end, he insisted on paying for the meal, despite our protestations.<br><br>I left the restaurant feeling a bit wobbly. The alcohol may have been partially responsible, but after two hours of being restrained it took a while to recover my equilibrium. We agreed that it was too early to turn in for the night, so it was suggested that we try one of the nightclubs. We chose a venue which did not appear overcrowded. Inside, however, the place was buzzing with sensual and sexual excitement. On the dance floor swept by lurid beams of flashing and strobing light were a dozen man-woman couples. Nude bodies writhed to the throbbing beat and pulsating light show, grazing with precise carelessness across the fabric of their partners' clothing. Naked flesh glistened with sweat, and gleaming glitter adhered to clammy skin. Unfettered breasts bounced to cacophonous rhythms. Bare bosoms and thighs rubbed impudently against shirts and trousers. Music blared, neon glared, people stared. A group of girls gushed onto the floor, bumping and grinding their bodies against each other, as the erotic energy surged to a climax. The place was a cross between paradise and pandemonium.<br><br>Waiters in casual slacks and floral shirts and waitresses attired only in what nature has provided moved through the crowd, plying their patrons with all sorts of exotic drink mixes. A brace of bouncers stood by to ensure that roving hands should not wander too far.<br><br>The scene was intoxicating but rather daunting, so we'd hesitated near the door. AdÃ¨le took the initiative and entered; but as she placed her backside on a stool, she squirmed and pouted in self-reproach. The seat was warm and moist with perspiration. But I was surprised that she had been so careless. It's why we carry wet wipes. Perhaps it was the wine. In any case, we decided unanimously that retreat was the better part of valor. We adjourned to a more placid setting a few doors down.<br><br>After a short stay we strolled along the waterfront. The wind had picked up, and I and the other women started to shiver once more. I could see Fin and Rob fighting the urge to take off their jackets to drape over their wives' shoulders. That would be against the law; but wrapping an arm around is not. Anyway, after the steamy environs of the nightclub, the sea breeze prickling my skin was delicious. The effects of the evening's drinks were wearing off, but the adrenaline high hadn't. I found myself giggling like a schoolgirl, and got some funny looks from my companions.<br><br>(It was mid-summer and I was a little disconcerted that it could get so cool -- not exactly cold, but enough that I began to appreciate the hardiness of Palmira's women. I would soon learn that these chilly spells are infrequent and brief; but when they occur you just have to bear it. No concessions are made except in the worst weather. But I like the fact that sometimes we have to be tough... tougher than the men. It's a reminder that the nude law honours feminine strength as much as beauty.)<br><br>The Esplanade was congested as we looked for a taxi. I could almost feel the eyes of passing men exploring my curves and crevices. It seems that inhibitions vanish with the setting of the sun, when instinct takes control. The brush of a man's shirt against my breasts as we zigzagged through the throng made me shudder; but it was not intentional. The multitude was well-disciplined, the men generally well-behaved.<br><br>However, out of one of the bars stumbled a pair of drunks, both males, scattering pedestrians as they meandered boisterously along the street. Two police officers, a man and a woman, were quickly on the scene, deftly stepping in to separate the inebriates from passers-by. One attempted to remonstrate with the policewoman, but she set him back with a sharp word and a menacing stare. Meanwhile, a commotion could be heard inside the bar, and her colleague went to investigate. More carousers spilled out of the building. They clamored about the naked cop. Unfazed, she ordered them to disperse. There was, for a moment, tension in the air; but first one, then another of the men peeled off and staggered away. The rest quickly followed. The plucky policewoman's nudity did not deter her from confronting the men nor diminish her control. It may even have helped defuse the situation. But I had not expected to witness anything like this. For all its uniqueness, Palmira has its raw elements. It is not a utopia. You wouldn't want it to be.<br><br>Indeed, farther along the Esplanade, near Patrick's Emporium, a bizarre and unsettling tableau reminded us of the dark side of Palmira's history. It was by now mid-evening. The streets were still full of people and a large crowd was gathered around a grassy plaza. We interrupted our quest for a taxi to investigate. Under lurid lighting a dozen posts the width of telegraph poles had been set up in a semi-circle, about an arm's distance apart. To each a woman was shackled with a heavy-duty chain attached to a metal collar around her neck. Half were standing, the others kneeling. An auction was underway, and when one of the standing women was sold she knelt on the grass. Although the temperature was dropping, their bodies sparkled with perspiration, so I guessed their ordeal had begun before this act of the drama. Men in the audience were calling out bids, and since they were dressed in period costume, although it appeared authentic this was a mock sale. Yet not all the performers were part of an acting troupe. Three of the chained women were from the group of six on the plane, and their friends were calling out words of encouragement from the sidelines.<br><br>Puzzled by this strange spectacle, I picked up a pamphlet from a nearby stall and learned what I suspected, that this was not a reenactment of a slave auction, at least not in the "traditional" sense. The plaza was the site of the old bride bazaar -- a euphemism of sorts for the marketplace where Palmira's pirates had once traded their booty and purchased their wives, where women were put on sale alongside crops and livestock. My grandmother had told me that generations of her female ancestors had met their future husbands here, but had never gone into the specifics.<br><br>To be honest, I suspect that much of the folklore that Palmirenes cherish is, if not invented outright, embellished for the tourists. Maybe the locals have come to believe the mythology; Grandma seemed to. In any case, the legends endure, to the extent that women want to experience what it was like to be a woman in olden times. Even the most liberated of females in our own age retains an innate curiosity about how she would have lived in a less enlightened age. Certainly I have it. Still, this seems to me an extreme way of going about it.<br><br>We waited about twenty minutes until the show ended, each of the "brides" was freed from her collar and chain and the crowd began to disperse... quickly as it was getting cold. We had to wait for a taxi and I was now shivering. Back at the hotel, having left Ãlise and AdÃ¨le downtown to continue exploring the nightlife (and I had to admire their tenacity), the seven of us had coffee and I said my good-byes. Tomorrow morning I would be leaving the comforts of the HÃ´tel AndromÃ¨de for the dig site at CimarrÃ³n Bay. My holiday was over. A new phase of my life was beginning.</div>
        <div id="chapter6" class="chapter-content">I was awake half an hour before dawn, and went out onto the balcony to sit and think. I watched the shadows of the ridge behind the hotel retreat off the bay and up the beach. It was very peaceful. Rain had chased away the songbirds but had since dispersed. Nobody was congregating on the lawn this morning. No voices were coming from the adjacent deck. The silence was broken only by the distant roar of the waves and the haunting cries of far-off seagulls. A mellow breeze caressed my skin.<br><br>I went downstairs to the dining room where a buffet was being laid out; and while I normally forgo a hearty breakfast, today I needed the fuel. A youthful waiter was setting down platters of croissants and bagels. His artless mien suggested that he was a student on a working holiday. He had what I already recognized as the telltale traits of the novice to Palmira's ways. He glanced at the bodies of all the women, both staff and patrons; and when they didn't react he took a longer look. To my surprise, I found myself standing more erect and inhaling to puff out my chest. But he averted his eyeballing when the imperious cheffe de cuisine came out to inspect the arrangements and punctured his bubble with a formidable frown. (In one hand she clutched an apron, which had to come off the moment she left the kitchen.) Presumably it's improper to gape at the guests. So the young man shifted his gaze to her body, and she didn't seem to mind.<br><br>Back upstairs I packed my bag and then went outside to wait for Ricardo. Having already bid adieu to the friends I'd made, I felt no guilt at avoiding a final farewell. I did find Regina, already on duty at the reception desk, and promised her a personally guided tour of the dig site once I was settled in. Ricardo arrived on time and drove me to the Customs Office, where I signed for the boxes containing my belongings. They had come in on the overnight air freight service. The College had arranged for a pick-up, and my things were to be sent on to CimarrÃ³n Bay. I could have hitched a ride in the delivery van, but it was almost as quick to cross the island on foot. In any case, everyone hikes on Palmira.<br><br>Ricardo left me at the College with Rebecca. Acting the mother hen, she approved of my footwear and sun visor, but furrowed her brow until, understanding her concern, I showed her that I could convert my duffel bag into a rucksack. I was a tad offended that she might think me such a tenderfoot; but when I put it on she started to adjust the shoulder straps, lifting the bag higher on my back. It took me a moment to realize why, and I couldn't help laughing. The way I had it, the pack sagged too low. The modification may or may not have made for better walking posture; what was important was that my bare buttocks be exposed to public view. As I've already affirmed, the Palmirenes take their nude law seriously!<br><br>Rebecca accompanied me to the assembly point. She wouldn't be going with me to CimarrÃ³n, but I would have no dearth of companionship. In a park at the western end of the Esplanade, twenty or so people had gathered, also kitted up for the trek. The women were massaging their bodies with lavish amounts of sunscreen. Although I prefer cream to lotion, that was not an option... which was amusing. You aren't permitted to daub anything that isn't transparent on your body parts. Remembering Valerie's advice, I applied extra dabs to my breasts, especially my nipples, and between my legs.<br><br>Sarah and Rob were there. She was berating him over something. We greeted each other like long-lost family. She was dwarfed by her backpack, and I noticed that her little derriÃ¨re was hidden by its bulk. No one pulled her up on it. We walked together; and as the philosophers say, it's a small world. I discovered that Sarah is a physicist working on her doctoral dissertation. She had done research on radiometric dating techniques -- carbon-14, potassium-argon, thermoluminescence -- and so had an interest in archaeology. It was a pity that her sojourn on Palmira was almost over. She had toured a couple of the dig sites, but I would have liked the opportunity to show her around.<br><br>There were two distinct groups of walkers, although we went as one from RÃ©gate to CimarrÃ³n Bay, a distance of five kilometres (three miles). We didn't have a guide because the path is well-defined; and we didn't really need to stick together. But once the first couple had set off everyone else automatically followed.<br><br>Most of the trekkers were young, although there were a middle-aged husband and wife. A Japanese couple appeared to be botanists or herbalists, because they took samples of various types of plants along the way. They were obviously dedicated to their vocation; the woman bore a tattoo of a serpentine vine with intriguing symbolism. It emerged from the cleft between her buttocks, snaked across her left butt cheek, over her hip, down her belly and into her vagina. Up ahead was a party of five girls and two guys. During one of our brief breaks I learned that they were recently graduated medical students from the United States. From their athletic physiques I guessed they were adventuresome types; but the girls' fading tan lines revealed that they were not used to full outdoor nudity. They had been taking annual "extreme" holidays -- rock climbing, mountain biking, canyoning, ice canoeing, that sort of thing -- and confessed that this was their most audacious. It was the first time they had brought along males, to act as chaperones (or, as Bethany put it, "to keep us out of mischief"). Josh and Miguel are gay, and the girls at first had thought they might need convincing to tag along. But as Miguel pointed out, there's no reason why he can't appreciate the aesthetic appeal of the female body.<br><br>That got me thinking (again). Palmira is bliss for heterosexual males, offering visual delights unobtainable elsewhere. And it's a sublime experience for us women. But I imagine it's especially so for lesbians and bisexual women, who get to enjoy both sides of nudity's sensual pleasures. I thought of the goth-punk girls and wondered where on the island they might now be -- somewhere to the north, probably, where most of the hiking trails lead.<br><br>Our route took us through the eastern outskirts of RÃ©gate and up the forested ridge to a maximum elevation of about two hundred metres, which we reached in just over an hour. From the summit the view of CimarrÃ³n Bay was spectacular, but to our rear trees blocked the vista of equally scenic Regatta Bay. Unlike the latter as seen from our plane, CimarrÃ³n was placid, with half a dozen small watercraft and a few buildings scattered along and near the shore. The dig site was invisible. It had not been a difficult ascent, but once we left the shelter of the densest part of the forest on the descending track, the sun shone upon us from a cloudless sky. There was not a whiff of breeze, and it was nice to be out in nature au naturel, my whole body bathed in the golden virility of the solar rays. I felt a bit sorry for the men.<br><br>The stretch of road down the eastern side of the ridge is rough for vehicles but ideal for walking. However, the country we moved through was an eerie landscape of empty houses and deserted hamlets. Without a reliable fresh water supply, Palmirenes have largely given up farming and abandoned the countryside. Most of the buildings that are still occupied have been converted into holiday homes. We saw a few women, pottering in their gardens, cycling along the road, members of a work crew clearing undergrowth for fire prevention; and we were reminded that the nude law applies outside RÃ©gate.<br><br>As we came into CimarrÃ³n village, we were greeted by a man and woman who directed the larger of our two groups to a kiosk for refreshments and a briefing on the next stage of their trek, followed by a quick tour of the excavations nearby. He was in khaki shirt and shorts, and she had on a khaki collar, so I assumed they were park rangers. I said good-bye once more to Rob and Sarah. Their party were continuing northward on a three-day camping excursion. I admired the resilience of the women who would be bivouacking as well as hiking nude.<br><br>The six of us who were staying at this location awaited our escort. It had been two hours since we had set out, so it was still just mid-morning. I used the time to further get to know my remaining companions. All had signed up for fieldwork at the dig. Jack and Lorraine, the middle-aged couple, are Americans who pursue their passion for ancient history by volunteering on excavation sites around the world. They are members of an organization which does a great job promoting public archaeology.<br><br>Rachel and Lucinda are students from Australia. (Palmira gets a large contingent of visitors from down under. My theory is that because we already have a near-ubiquitous beach culture, many Aussies look for something more than just the basic sun, sand and sea.) Rachel is high-spirited and gregarious. She has classic beach-girl looks -- very pretty, sandy-haired, blue-eyed and freckled-faced, slim but sturdy. A jagged scar running up the inside of her left leg is the result of a surfing mishap. Her all-over tan and a leaping dolphin tattoo which arcs around the contours of her mons pubis reveal that she is not a novice nudist. Lucy is small, olive-skinned and dark-haired with large brown eyes. She's more introverted than Rachel but with a subtly mischievous wit. The two complement each other, and have already worked together on a couple of digs, although this was their first overseas. Sean is from Ireland, with the stereotypical green eyes and red hair, and was at the time the youngest member of the team at CimarrÃ³n. Unlike the girls he's not studying archaeology. Like Jack and Lorraine he wants to travel the globe as more than a mere sightseer, choosing to be a part of the local culture.<br><br>Soon after the other hikers had departed, site director Mike Renshaw and Sue Keppel the site manager came to meet us. He is Rebecca's deputy and is responsible for coordinating all aspects of the excavation, including personnel, health and safety, public relations and liaison with government agencies. Her role is the management of day-to-day operations -- logistics, daily assignments, risk assessment and so on.<br><br>We were the last of their team to arrive for the season. Sue showed us first to our living quarters, a five-minute walk up the road. What is known affectionately as the Barracks is a travelers' hostel, part of which is rented by the Palmira Archaeological Field Research Institute. Because, I suppose, most of the students are undergraduates, unmarried residents are sexually segregated. Rachel and Lucy were assigned to a six-bed dormitory while I, as one of the professionals, was accorded the privilege (modest though it was) of a twin-share.<br><br>All the hostel staff but one are women. This may be the hiring practice, but since the majority are "work for accommodation" backpackers it also reflects the fact that most itinerant workers on Palmira are female. The exception is Albert, the concierge. An unself-aware embodiment of the hostel, he has an antiquated look and style, always neatly attired in a faded grey suit. His weather-beaten face sets in an expression that is at once benign and intimidating. He commands his nude platoon like a retired sergeant-major, which possibly he is. With all females, staff and guest alike, he is grouchily paternalistic.<br><br>I found that my boxes had been delivered to my room; but before I could begin unpacking Albert summoned Rachel, Lucy and me into the corridor to give us a stern lecture, expounding on the DOs and DON'Ts of his domain, reciting rules and setting weekday and weekend curfews that both he and we knew he could not enforce. But we indulged him. Perhaps he was expecting orgies (we females being slaves to our hormones, after all), but more likely he was just being protective. So it was hard to suppress a grin at the irony, as we were lectured about modesty and decorum while standing there stark naked. However, his unnecessary reminder that we mustn't wear any clothing at any time made us a bit fidgety. Perhaps our reaction was illogical; but having a fully clothed man haranguing us that we must expose our bodies was a tad vexing.<br><br>Meanwhile, Sean was waiting for us down the hall, grinning like the proverbial Cheshire cat. Although he's younger than us, I'll wager he didn't get treated like a naughty schoolboy. In defence of his attitude, I'll concede that on our trek he had endured some puerile badinage from Rachel -- good-natured teasing such as her advice that he should wear baggier trousers if he was going to be around naked girls all the time, and the more acerbic suggestion that he hadn't come to Palmira just to dig in the dirt. And since strong-willed Rachel was the most perturbed by the sergeant-major's sermon, Sean enjoyed witnessing her comeuppance.<br><br>Sue was waiting for us in the lobby and noted at our expressions. "The old boy is quite a character, isn't he? Don't worry; we all get the same treatment." She glowered at Sean. "Unless you have a penis." She then switched to a benevolent smile.<br><br>Sue is the person I answer directly to and with whom I have developed the closest working relationship. She's physically slight but nevertheless imposing, both down-to-earth and larger-than-life, plain-spoken but sympathetic and supportive. Though she excels in the practical, she has a PhD in classical literature. In her role as site manager she's everything from quartermaster to mechanic to electrician to counsellor. I have been on quite a few digs, and Sue is as competent and hard-working as any site boss I've known... and she does it all naked.<br><br>I was already conversant with Sue's work. Her field reports are required reading for aspiring archaeologists. Yet I developed even more respect when I got to know her in person. She came to Palmira three years ago, fresh from managing a Mayan dig in Belize. Her new job was to assess storm damage to the exposed coastal sites, and she has stayed on. She's forbearing about her nudity but doesn't share the pleasure or the thrill that most of us feel. She's very matter-of-fact about it, neither bold nor bashful. Indeed, because of her pragmatic approach to everything, it was Sue who alerted me to one aspect of compulsory nudity I hadn't thought of, menstrual management. Yes, it's an issue, because you are not permitted to cover any part of your genitalia. So feminine hygiene products must be worn internally, at least in public -- tampons or menstrual cups. To repeat, Palmirenes take their nude law very seriously.<br><br>As it was midday, and apart from us and the staff the hostel was deserted. Packed lunches are prepared each day for the team, and six had been left for us. After that it was time to head down to the dig site. It is right on the edge of the beach, and a sea wall has been constructed to halt the erosion that once threatened the excavations. (The government has now banned sand-mining in the area, which had been a major contributor to beach attrition.) The buildings -- dig shed, site office, science hut, etcetera -- are a short distance inland. Ancient middens (domestic waste deposits) and cemeteries extend along much of the shore of the bay. A row of broad trenches has been cut at right angles into the banks of sand, clay and coral rock debris. Around two dozen people were working in these ditches; and had I not been acclimatized to Palmira, the sight would have been baffling, even a bit shocking. For it almost goes without saying, by this point in my story, that all the women, who make up the majority of on-site personnel, were bare-skinned but for headgear, footwear and gloves.<br><br>Work on an archaeological site is serious business. The physical labor can be difficult and is often tedious (for example, the sifting and sorting). The remains are fragile and unless you're very careful with recording and documentation, things can get mixed up, context and chronology can be hopelessly scrambled; so there's lots of bookkeeping to be done. But it can be incredibly rewarding, because while you don't expect to make any paradigm-changing breakthroughs, each object unearthed is a new piece of an historical puzzle, adding to the sum of our knowledge. Hence everyone is highly motivated.<br><br>Contrary to the popular view of archaeologists -- as adventurers like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft, or professional palaeologists like Howard Carter -- many are volunteer enthusiasts, such as Jack and Lorraine, who pay their own expenses for the privilege of spending several hours every day under the sun scratching in the dirt... and without whom very few projects would be viable. The veteran amateurs have more fieldwork experience than the students and even some of the career specialists. They contribute not just their labor but their maturity, know-how and intellectual curiosity. And because they come from all walks of life with careers outside archaeology and anthropology, they bring fresh perspectives and insights.<br><br>While there has to be a hierarchy, a sort of democracy prevails on-site. Everybody gets their hands dirty; and each afternoon when we gather in the dig hut to report on our progress, and in the evening when we discuss the day's finds, everyone has a say and is listened to.<br><br>So after ten years in the field, it was rather jolting to see the sexes so starkly differentiated. And I have not yet really gotten used to it. We women toil as hard as the men but do so nude. On most weekends we go to RÃ©gate, or hike the nature trails, or head for one of the beaches, satellite islands or dive sites for rejuvenation, and being the dÃ©shabillÃ© sex is part of the fun. But it still feels weird supervising my team members, giving orders to men whose simple act of putting on clothes is illegal for me.</div>
        <div id="chapter7" class="chapter-content">The full complement at CimarrÃ³n once I'd arrived was twenty-seven -- ten senior (professional) members, eight students and nine volunteers. We newcomers spent the rest of the day acquainting ourselves with our colleagues and familiarizing ourselves with the facilities and techniques. (Each site has its unique features, according to the history, the environment and the people on the job.) We started working the following morning, but on that first day we took part in the afternoon conference and joined everyone for dinner at the hostel. The camaraderie was the same as at all the digs where I've worked.<br><br>As on every site, although it's not a case of all work and no play, people are usually too tired at the end of the day for much socializing. But letting off steam on weekends is important for morale; for regardless of how dedicated you are, everyone needs some downtime. My previous archaeological projects were in remote areas. There were few opportunities for rest and recreation beyond the camp. Palmira offers plenty, in the towns, in the countryside and in the surrounding waters.<br><br>We did have some good times in the Barracks, albeit under the sullen surveillance of the sergeant-major. While we don't get to choose our companions, given that our interests are similar all the people working on a site will be basically compatible. Each weeknight after dinner we gathered on the terrace, a covered recreational area with a bar and barbeque, or in the theatrette. Nudity was generally a non-issue, partly because we the unclad heavily outnumbered the men, but mainly because you cannot afford to fixate on it, otherwise you will end up in a state of permanent arousal -- both sexes.<br><br>Inevitably in the group there will be some hooking up, particularly among the younger members; and the rule is that whatever you do off-site stays off-site. Most interactions are casual; intimate relationships tend to be short-lived. For those without partners on the scene there are usually spouses, fiancÃ©s, boyfriends, girlfriends back home. In any case, the priority is to maintain a professional environment (and there are ethical considerations as well). Furthermore, a typical "season" lasts just six to eight weeks, and even during that period people are coming and going.<br><br>My roommate was Alice, the first aid and hygiene officer. She's a winsome, amber-eyed brunette aged in her early thirties who left behind a career in medicine to pursue her passion. She has been on several sites in the Americas (she's from Chicago), and this is her second season on Palmira. Like most of us she claims that the island's archaeological heritage is the main attraction, but she clearly revels in her nudity. She isn't flashy or flirty, but she takes pride not just in her body but in the fact that she's naked. In other words she takes pride in her womanhood; and in that respect we're similar. Unfortunately, we did not have much time together. She spends only the dig sessions on the island, and donates her services on weekends to the Palmira Hospital. And while that's laudable, my personal belief is that when you work as hard as we do during the week, you really need to let loose and live it up when you can.<br><br>Because we were the latecomers who arrived together, and they were assigned to my team, I bonded best with Rachel, Lucy and Sean. (Jack and Lorraine mostly kept to themselves in the off-hours.) I became a sort of godmother to them. Sean acted immature at times, and liked to pull juvenile pranks; but his enthusiasm was infectious and his work ethic commendable. He was adopted as a little brother by Rachel, whose irreverent high spirits matched his, and by Lucy, whose calm demeanour counteracted their at times unruly joie de vivre. At the same time, when we went to RÃ©gate for the weekend he fancied himself as our guardian, and we allowed him to bask in the glow of his gallantry, even Rachel. Of course, our surrogate roles were somewhat compromised by the way he looked so blatantly at our bodies. He enjoyed hanging out with older women -- such as yours truly. He really enjoyed hanging out with naked women; and he was one of the males most candid about it, disarmingly guileless in his fondness for the undraped female form.<br><br>We all got on well with the hostel staff. Being guest workers, they shared our experiences. Mostly students taking a gap year, they are well-educated, good-humored and broadminded. They don't appear to chafe under the thumb of the sergeant-major, possibly because they don't have the luxury of nursing grievances. Still, they have their methods of rebellion. At the beginning of the day shift, he makes them line up for inspection. They stand rigidly at attention, thrusting out their chests, sucking in their bellies, extending their hips to the fore, and I have rarely beheld a more provocatively titillating sight. He beams in clueless approbation of their soldierly discipline.<br><br><p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br></p>Naturally, most of one's life is focused on the dig. The day at CimarrÃ³n starts at sunrise when Mike and Sue check the weather forecast. If it's good news, everyone has an early breakfast, eager to get onto the site. The day's briefing begins at half past seven, the spadework at eight o'clock.<br><br>My role during my inaugural season on Palmira was to oversee excavation of one of the trenches, recording and bagging all sorts of stuff -- human remains (biological materials and artifacts) being the most dramatic, but also seeds, shells and non-human bones (mammals, birds, fish) -- and taking soil samples. When digging stops in the early afternoon, the analysis phase begins. My tasks included writing up a diary, comparing results with my colleagues to prepare a detailed grid map, and consulting with the conservator, whose job is the preservation of finds.<br><br>My crew consisted initially of my fellow newcomers. Jack and Lorraine, who had put in almost as many fieldwork hours as I, and had worked on more sites, served as my trusted deputies. We were given a basic first assignment, digging test pits looking for signs of burials and other objects of interest. In this you have to be cautious, and you record everything meticulously, because any interference with fragile remains can damage them. But we proved ourselves a crack squad and were soon assigned to a trench where we uncovered a grave with some fascinating ceramic and carved bone ceremonial items. We also had a role in unearthing an even more significant burial, containing one body and two skulls. This is the best evidence yet found of ancestor worship in ancient Palmirene culture.<br><br>Working stark naked under the tropical sun is not a major problem so long as you have UV protection. But when you're down in the dirt in a meter-deep trench, the mud and grit get into your crevices. So at the end of your shift it's a major operation to wash the grime off (and out of) you.<br><br>Behind the dig hut are toilet cubicles, and to indicate that they're unisex, on the door of each are the standard graphic symbols for man and woman; but in this setting the stylized figure in a dress seems comically incongruous. And next to the lavatories is a shower and changing room... for the men. Since the women don't need to change into or out of anything, until recently the females' amenity was a row of shower heads out in the open. The thinking was that there's no point investing resources in private facilities for those who don't get that sort of privacy. But the spectacle of us lathering, scrubbing and sponging our bodies under the public gaze is not exactly conducive to dignity, so a partition has been erected. Of course, not having to worry about damp clothes means we don't need to bother drying ourselves. The warm breeze does that.<br><br>There are other advantages to being the bare-skinned sex. One of my favorite humdrum tasks is wet screening -- sieving soil and other sediments in sea water to look for small objects. It's mostly mindless repetition so you sing and chat and joke; but occasionally some tiny object will catch the eye and another little bit will be added to the overall picture of the site. For this, there are two instruments. The large frame is a heavy scaffold and a hose is used. The small frame version is hand-held, and the screening is a two-person job. It's done by both men and women, standing in the water that reaches up to waist-deep when the waves come in; and being female means you don't have to bother stripping down to a swimsuit.<br><br>Before the team gets started each day, Sue does a health and safety inspection. Because almost all the work is small-scale and thus done by hand -- with minimal mechanical aid, using picks and shovels, buckets and spades, trowels and brushes -- this is a routine procedure. Boots, gloves and headgear are mandatory, sunglasses and bandanas are recommended. Knee-pads are helpful, but a kneeling mat is better. High-factor sunblock and insect repellent are vital for both sexes, although obviously we ladies need more.<br><br>The men can choose clothing that is cool, lightweight, comfortable and sweat-proof. (And they have pockets!) They can avoid the sun with long sleeves and trousers, but even in shorts and short-sleeved shirts they have a lot less skin to protect than we gals do. However, the sun does not present a major problem. We dig in the trenches for only a few hours each day because of the follow-up to be done; and we normally do so under tarpaulin covers. These are not just for shade but to shelter the trench and its contents from rain. In fact digging has to cease when it's raining, because while typically of short duration Palmira's downpours can be very intense. Even with the tarps in place water fills the trenches, so work stops for the day. At such times, there are lots of other chores to keep us busy.<br><br>If special protective clothing is needed, for example with some of the more vigorous excavation, Sue must make a decision. Giving these jobs to the males exclusively would be unfair to both sexes; and no-one tries to take advantage of her nudity to get out of the hard work; but a woman must wear the absolute minimum of gear necessary, and must take it off as soon as the task is done. (In fact, I have never had the need to wear anything because my forte is hand-tool excavation.) It is one of Sue's responsibilities to file the appropriate paperwork to make any exemptions official. This is important because there is something to always keep in mind about the nude law. It's a law. And when people break the law there are consequences.<br><br>A week or so after my arrival, a work party moved into the village planting trees and doing maintenance work on the road. They reminded me of the gang clearing undergrowth we had passed on my first day at CimarrÃ³n; and I was informed that they were performing court-ordered community service. There were twenty-one of them, twelve young males, and nine females who covered a wider range of years, from twenties to forties. They all had straw hats, canvas gloves and boots. The men also wore mustard-colored bib-and-brace overalls and white T-shirts. They were supervised by male and female correctional officers. The woman's occupation and rank were denoted by blue-and-white armbands. If she dared to wear what the men under her supervision wore, she'd be joining them digging and planting.<br><br>Many countries have community service orders. They are issued for relatively minor offences like property damage, public intoxication, petty theft and non-grievous assault. I was now enlightened about one of the harsher realities of Palmira. Women who cover their bodies without good reason can be arrested. The penalty is a fine, imprisonment or up to a hundred hours of involuntary labor. It's almost always the latter. So to satisfy my curiosity, I later checked the Palmira Government Gazette, where law enforcement statistics are published. While most male offenders on the community service program have committed what are everywhere classed as crimes, the females have mostly been sentenced for the uniquely Palmirene transgression of putting on clothing. It doesn't matter if it's a bikini or a boiler suit; if you're wearing it, you're breaking the law. So it still amuses me that a man will be prosecuted for "indecent" exposure, while a woman will be prosecuted for not exposing herself. But it bothers me even now that a tradition which is such a source of joy and pride is imposed with the threat of punishment.<br><br>I don't know how many of the females were there for breaking the nude law, although the age range suggested it was the majority. (For why would women in their forties be more likely to commit minor crimes than males in their twenties... except for the crime of wearing clothes?) In that case, I was curious about why they had done so. It stands to reason that the nude law is not universally popular. There will be women who object to it. They must live with it. No society is perfect.<br><br><p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br></p>One of the tasks of staff members is to conduct tours of the site. Some of my colleagues dislike this duty, claiming it distracts from the "real" work. I disagree. Public outreach is a very important part of what we do.<br><br>One time we had a visit from a group of university students from the United States. I give them credit for including a tour of our site on their itinerary, but it took them a while to be convinced that we were a genuine operation and not a mock-up for the tourists. They had been on the island for more than a week but still appeared startled at seeing two-thirds of our team doing the job naked. So we gave them a taste by putting them to work. I don't think the guys had as much fun as the girls, especially under the showers afterwards judging from the laughing and squealing emanating from behind the partition. So while I don't know if archaeology earned any career commitments that day, half a dozen young women got a new perspective on full-time nudity.<br><br>Another notable occasion was an inspection by the island's Governor, Amanda Kennedy. Although Palmira is an independent state, political and commercial ties with the United Kingdom remain strong, and Ms Kennedy is the Queens' representative. She is the first woman to hold the office, and came to Palmira with a distinguished record of public service. She is not legally bound by the nude law, but at CimarrÃ³n she and the other women in her retinue wore nothing but hat and heels. She is statuesque, with dark expressive eyes and long auburn tresses that she keeps tied back, away from her breasts. It was an informal occasion, but her vice-regal bearing was an insightful example of how a woman in high office can maintain her dignitas, gravitas and nobilitas when completely nude. The Deputy Governor, a prim little man with a comb-over, looked uncomfortable on this sultry afternoon in his stuffy three-piece suit.<br><br>The Governor, who has a reputation for firmness and outspokenness and defending the prerogatives of her office, could grant herself dispensation from the nude law, but hasn't. However, the statutes do make allowance for special circumstances for all women. There are reasons aside from health and safety why a woman may be exempted. The authorities -- police, magistrates and government ministers -- are empowered to make singular and short-term exceptions. Medical and mental health professionals can issue certificates of exemption. Women over sixty years of age and girls under eighteen are exempted; but you don't see many of these outside Grandin where the nude law is not enforced. Although most adults work beyond the enclave, nearly all families have their homes there.<br><br>Soon after the Governor's visit, my first dig season ended. There are three during the year, lasting a total of eighteen weeks. During the off-season most of the professional team-members go back to their home countries. (There are no native Palmirenes based at CimarrÃ³n because, as mentioned, local historians focus on more recent history.) I have stayed, giving classes to undergraduate students and mentoring postgrads at Palmira College; and I help run the teaching and demonstration dig at Grandin Bay. Unlike the other sites, this one operates all year round. I still have plenty of spare time for gratis work at the museum. It is not very large but the displays are outstanding. Several of the burials from CimarrÃ³n and other sites have been recreated and part of a 1500-year-old village reconstructed.<br><br>The museum does not receive as many visitors as I would like, but one was a very well-known singer-songwriter. I shall call her Stella. (Don't try to figure out her identity from that, because it simply means "star".) She was inquisitive about Palmira's history, and despite her party-girl persona impressively well-informed. So on impulse I invited her to join us at the teaching dig site, and she eagerly accepted, taking part in the excavation for a few hours. It had been raining and the ground was waterlogged, and she looked as happy as a pig in mud, still gorgeous and glamorous covered in nothing but gunk and goo.<br><br>Stella could have used Grandin's special status to evade the nude law, but she didn't wear clothes inside the enclave. After all, it's the exotic charm of Palmira and its laws which drew her to this island in the first place. Indeed, it attracts more than a few celebrities. I've seen a multiple-award-winning actress, a best-selling authoress, a world-champion sportswoman, a renowned businesswoman, and so on. You would recognize the names instantly if I revealed them; but if they wanted publicity I wouldn't have to. In fact, Palmira enforces a strict code of privacy which includes robust anti-paparazzi laws; and the non-intrusive attitude of vacationers and locals alike is part of Palmira's appeal. An illustrious face will be less eye-balled than it would be elsewhere; and I don't just mean that people's attention is focused lower.<br><br>Nevertheless, while normally I'm not at all star-struck, I have to admire the courage of these high-profile women to be themselves, because despite the precautions photos can leak out to the tabloids and gossip sites. Not everyone outside Palmira appreciates and respects its ways; so what is a woman's pride and joy on the island can be a source of embarrassment beyond its shores.<br><br>I later encountered Stella and her entourage on the Boulevard in RÃ©gate. It disappointed me, a little, that she travelled with a retinue of retainers, albeit just three, but she greeted me like a long-lost friend and invited me to lunch. I had to decline an evening rendezvous because I had an previous engagement. However, during our time together I realized that if you are famous, travel a lot and deal with all sorts of people and situations, a personal assistant, manager and so on are not your staff, they're your companions. But one of Stella's was male; and he superciliously flaunted his "privilege" (as he saw it) of being permitted to wear clothes with flamboyant attire that made the whole group stand out in a crowd.<br><br>It's a commonplace phenomenon that a celebrity is more unassuming and undemanding than the underlings who grasp their opportunity to shine brighter than the star they serve. And Stella was too good-natured to pull rank on her flunky and order him to tone it down... But I appear to have entered preaching mode again, so I shall end this chapter now.</div>
        <div id="chapter8" class="chapter-content">
Although during the non-dig part of the year I stay at a RÃ©gate boarding house, I spend a lot of my time in Grandin. The boundary is unfenced, but for those leaving the enclave there are signs which bear the same message as that displayed in the airport terminal.
		<p style="font-size: 130%; text-align: center;">"NO ADULT FEMALE WEARING CLOTHES MAY PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT."</p>
After just a few days on Palmira you get so used to what's around you that when you enter the precinct it's a little jarring to see a woman wearing clothing. But not many. While nudity isn't compulsory in Grandin, most women there don't cover up their bodies.<br><br>There are obviously exceptions to the rule, on both sides. In schools, health care venues and places of worship nudity for under-18s is not allowed; otherwise whether or not a girl wears clothes, inside or beyond the enclave, is the prerogative of her parents. So one's eighteenth birthday is especially momentous for Palmirene girls, something they approach with heady anticipation. Like their brothers they are now legal adults, they can vote, they can take control of their lives; but becoming a woman is special because it means being subject to the nude law. It's not an imposition; it's an entitlement.<br><br>Palmirene children are accustomed to seeing women naked, including their mothers and teachers. The latter have a choice on school premises, all of which are in Grandin; but though not mandated, nudity is just about universal. Teachers don't have a problem with standing naked in front of a class. For them and their students it's a simple fact of life.<br><br>The undergraduate campus of Palmira College is located in Grandin. Females comprise about sixty per cent of the faculty and the student body. Because the age of entry is eighteen, while nudity is technically optional the women are naked without exception. The young men are dressed how you would find them at any university -- in jeans, chinos, capris, cargo shorts, plaid shirts, polo shirts, flannel shirts, T-shirts, etcetera.<br><br>Around half of all the College's enrolled students, two-thirds of postgrads, are from overseas. They come from all over the world. There are plenty of casual and part-time jobs available, mainly in tourism, some in the financial sector, and the wages are generous. Tuition fees are relatively low, but not at the expense of the quality of education provided. The Palmirene government uses these benefits as incentives to encourage graduates to settle permanently, and some do. There are other attractions, of course, including the idyllic environment and friendly people. The nude law is clearly not a deterrent, for students or for foreign-born academic staff, and for many if not most it's a major part of the appeal.<br><br>Palmira hosts several embassies, consulates and high commissions, all based in Grandin. For these there are protocols regarding nudity. Although it's not de rigueur, female members of the diplomatic community who go outside the precinct's boundaries abide by the law. They can stay inside if they're reluctant to bare all, but it would be a dreary life, confined to a corner of this beautiful island.<br><br>I got to meet Australia's representative. Heather Turley is Honorary Consul. A career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, she met her husband James, a Palmirene citizen, on a diplomatic mission. She has ambassadorial privileges and could disregard the nude law if she wished to do so. Naturally she doesn't.<br><br>I first met her at a reception hosted by the expatriate community for "important" foreigners living on the island. I was flattered (and somewhat baffled) to be included in that company. It was held at the Governor's mansion in Grandin and was a black-tie function for the men. All the women, including the Governor and Heather, were nude.<br><br>Heather is a stylish woman who speaks in quiet but assertive tones; and there's a warm glow of confidence and sophistication about her. She is not classically beautiful; she has a slightly androgynous appearance, with a strong face and frame; but the wonderful thing about nudity is that women like her exude as much sensuality and sexuality as any beauty queen bombshell. So while Heather does not come across as conventionally feminine, next to her husband in his tuxedo there was no mistaking her for anything but female.<br><br>On reflection, I realize that this was the first organized social gathering (as opposed to informal get-togethers with my colleagues) I had attended. But soon afterwards I was invited to spend a weekend with the Renettes, my relatives. They live on Frigate Island, proprietors of Palmira's most luxurious hotel, the Chevron. It is larger and grander than the AndromÃ¨de. On the other hand, Regina's family owns two establishments, so the score between the two clans is pretty much even.<br><br>I took the ferry from RÃ©gate for a sixty-minute cruise. Upon arrival I was greeted by my second cousin, Sabrina. She's aged in her early twenties and is almost impossibly gorgeous, with azure eyes and flame-gold tresses that cascade onto her slender shoulders like a river of fire. Her smile is radiant, her skin is flawless and her body is divine. She moves with feline grace. Very much cognizant of her own splendor, she draws back her shoulders as if to emphasize her perfect breasts; and when she's still she casually pushes forward her pelvis, as if to proclaim her womanhood. But her body language betrays that she's not entirely at ease with her nudity, though she wears it (so to speak) proudly. Her haughtiness evokes vulnerability. There's a distance in her demeanor, a coldness in her eyes as if they were about to turn from ocean-blue to glacier-blue. It's not that she's rude or acts aloof -- quite the opposite, although that seems more a product of good breeding than an intrinsic part of her nature.<br><br>There were two dozen passengers on the boat, and several were bound like me for the Chevron Hotel. One of the now familiar open-air taxis awaited us onshore, and a young man was at the wheel. It is immediately obvious when you see them that he is Sabrina's twin brother. Xander (short for Alexander) has the same striking features, but in an odd way not as well defined, almost blurred. It's his manner. He doesn't project himself. He's grown up in the shadow of his sister, who is easily the dominant sibling. His expression is one of apathetic detachment. His clothes droop on him; he has the sort of languid bearing where even a tailored suit appears ill-fitting. By comparison, Sabrina is acutely aware of her naked beauty.<br><br>The twins' mother, Lydia, is English, and you see where they inherited their looks. They were born in Britain but grew up on Palmira. Kudos to them that, like Regina and her brother, Sabrina and Xander have taken on regular jobs at the hotel. Yet they seem frustrated by the ennui imposed by their limited horizons. Both are intelligent and intellectually curious, and were enchanted by my "worldly" experience and academic credentials. During my visit they interrogated me endlessly about life in Australia, about archaeology and even about Palmirene history.<br><br>That night a soirÃ©e was held to welcome the cousin from down under. It was a more elaborate affair than anything I'm cozy with, and for an unpretentious gal who eschews glamour, glitz and glitter, nudity proved a blessing. No fancy gown to worry about. But I was lavished with exquisite jewelry -- a pearl encrusted barrette, emerald earrings and a turquoise pendant on a black velvet choker. It was weird to be so expensively embellished from the neck up and totally unadorned below. In fact, I ended up even more denuded than before.<br><br>Earlier, I had blamed my disheveled hair on the wind during my trip across the water; but that cut no ice with frosty Sabrina. She took me down to the hotel's beauty salon for a hairdressing overhaul. I have to admit that my unruly shag cut was transformed for the better into a sassy side-swept crop. But then Sabrina lowered the back of my chair, and when I was horizontal she ordered me to spread my legs. She instructed the coiffeuse to shave me (because a more thorough depilation would leave me with inflamed pubes for the evening), but advised that I should get a waxing when I returned to the mainland. I decided against resisting, since I'd been thinking about a move in that direction anyway. Nevertheless, I remained ambivalent. I have always associated pubic hair removal with presenting a "clean" bikini line, and that is plainly not an issue on Palmira. While aesthetic preferences play a role, it's mainly to distinguish married from unmarried women, and this is a fairly recent (and in my opinion unnecessary) trend. Nevertheless, after I'd returned to CimarrÃ³n and everyone complimented me on my double hair makeover, I went for my waxing.<br><br>I later decided on electrolysis for permanent or at least long-term epilation. (Laser treatment is also an option.) Most women avoid the no-going-back track because they want pubic hair when they marry. However, the tide of that trend seems to be ebbing.<br><br>The soirÃ©e was attended by members of what counts as the local Ã©lite. It was presided over by Lydia, who marshalled her guests and serving staff with the command presence of a major-general. As I had already perceived, Palmira is very much a matriarchal society. The Renette women rule their aristocratic roost; and as I'd also learnt, being naked does not preclude power. Indeed, in an interesting way their womenfolk's mandatory nudity gives the males of Palmira a uniquely resilient sense of their masculinity, which obviates gratuitous displays of macho egoism. They are easy-going and user-friendly. I once heard a man described as being strong enough that he can afford to be tender; and I think there's a similar principle at work with Palmirene men. They have nothing to prove. Their identity and security as males is reaffirmed all around them all the time, so they can get on with being good men. (I'm not criticizing males elsewhere; but the Palmirenes seem to be a breed apart.) I've also heard it said that a strong woman is she who can bring out the best in a man. Palmirene women do that. It's not the essential purpose of the nude law -- at least not these days -- but it's what you might call a fringe benefit.<br><br>Virginia Woolf once wrote: "Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size." And in a way, a positive way, that's the case on Palmira.<br><br>And the thing is, this is one of the least sexist environments you can imagine. For it's a well-attested truism that a person who's viewed as sexy is perceived to lack "agency" -- personal power, the ability to plan, act and exercise self-control, and even intelligence. This mainly impacts on women, because our clothing is genderized -- more revealing and sensual than men's in some cultures, more constricted in others. But that's not an issue on Palmira. You, as a woman, are not adversely judged on your state of undress, because your personal agency is undiminished, because you must be naked. Men see, every day and everywhere, women whose appearance is reduced entirely to the sexual and yet are clearly not lacking in competence or intellect. So to lay claim to any level of logical thinking, a Palmirene male will look beyond the skin-deep (so to speak).<br><br>Even so, it might be asserted that the nude law is sexist. On Palmira the female body is so revered that it is illegal to conceal it. Yet the intent and effect of the law are not the objectification of women. In this respect the critics (such as exist) are mistaken. Exposing your body to the world, being obliged by society's rules to abandon all inhibitions and put aside encumbering modesty, is an intensely personalizing and joyously liberating experience. And nudity being for one sex alone is not demeaning to females. Never have I been so conscious and proud of my womanhood. Like most women, I don't have a perfect figure or abounding confidence. I do not crave attention but neither do I shun it. Back home, on a beach in a bikini, I rate a few fleeting looks and that's nice. But on Palmira your body is the proverbial temple; it's hallowed ground -- admired, respected and well-treated. Both men and women come from all over the world to worship here; but it's the women who are worshipped. If it's true you're an object, you're an object of veneration.<br><br>All women are. Even in the company of demigoddesses like Lydia and Sabrina, there was a feeling of sisterhood amongst all the females in the room -- hostess, guests and waitresses alike. The uniformity of nudity imposes an egalitarian sodality which also transcends differences in shape, size and color. The expensive ornamentation we wore actually reinforced this effect, which may seem counterintuitive. Jewelry properly worn serves to enhance or call attention to what you're wearing without being a distraction. When you're not wearing anything else, that is what your accessories highlight.<br><br>(Sabrina and a couple of others wore dainty gold and silver waist chains which I hadn't known are legal until I saw a few in RÃ©gate. I now wear one sometimes. It tempts the line of sight downwards and upwards, from the raw sexuality of your breasts and vagina to the sensual safe space in between. It gives emphasis to the totality of your nakedness rather than this being just the exposure of your parts.)<br><br>Throughout the evening, the two sexes mingled without awkwardness, diffidence or dalliance. The most stimulating part was the conversation. On such occasions as this, I have found Palmirene high society to be very conversable, more literati than glitterati. Yet it still felt slightly surreal. Back home, a "cmnf" party would be a major event on the kinky calendar. On Palmira it's just another night out. More than at any other time since I'd been on Palmira, I felt as if I might be the woman in Manet's Luncheon on the Grass -- not flirting or flaunting, but not shrinking from the public gaze.<br><br>Waiters and waitresses circulated with trays of drinks and canapÃ©s, and I was again fascinated by the powerfully evocative contrast between the neat, rather old-fashioned uniforms (including crimson satin waistcoats) of the male servers and the dÃ©nudÃ© condition of the women they waited on. (And if I'm coming across as fixated on this subject... All I can say in my defense is that, though writing quite some time after the events I'm describing, I'm still captivated, baffled and turned on by it.)<br><br>A string quartet performed; and when the chamber music made way for dance melodies, I knew for certain that I would be kept busy. I waltzed with most of the males in the room, and not surprisingly the eroticism proved almost overpowering. During the slow dances the men's tuxedos pressed up against my bare body; wool, satin and silk caressed my skin. When the tempo sped up their jackets and trousers brushed and grazed my body from breasts to thighs and my arousal was such that I feared I might drip fluids on the floor or leave a damp patch on the front of my partner's trousers. It was the most stimulated, and most self-conscious, I had felt since arriving on Palmira.<br><br>Wearing only pretty baubles and a sociable smile, as the guest of honor I occupied center stage all evening, so all eyes were on me. I no longer enjoyed the safety in numbers. But I recalled a snazzy one-liner from the celebrated stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. "I wasn't naked; I was completely covered by a blue spotlight."

        <div id="chapter9" class="chapter-content">Daniel arrived on Palmira near the end of the dig season at CimarrÃ³n Bay. He's what one might call an armchair archeologist. He studies the information gathered by those of us who get our hands dirty. That's not a put-down; he's no mere dilettante. He specializes in the analysis and synthesis of prior scholarship, not primary, in-the-field, hands-on research. But he keeps himself grounded, so to speak, by visiting archaeological sites to observe how we collect data; and since I became his academic adviser he has toured all the sites I've worked at. So he didn't come to Palmira just for the sightseeing.<br><br>I met him at the airport, and although he knew what to expect, by the time he'd gone through customs he was already mind-boggled and goggle-eyed. He had flown from Jamaica with two young women, Monique and Kris, who had been attending a conference in Florida. I watched through the glass partition as the girls stripped naked; and I could see how they enjoyed his attention. He tried to act nonchalant, but the pretense melted away when he came out of the lounge and saw me. It was as if he walked into an invisible wall. I allowed him to take a good long look at my body. I just smiled and he gave up trying to be subtle.<br><br>I had almost forgotten what it was like feeling awkward about being au naturel. I hadn't worn a thing in six weeks. And I have learnt that once you've become completely comfortable in your own skin (what an apt phrase!) you don't have to be cold or coy or coquettish. You don't feel the need to flourish or camouflage your feminine charms. But Daniel was the first person I knew from back home to encounter me in the flesh in my new habitat. What's more, I was his mentor and academic confidante. Our relationship has always been strictly platonic (in the sense of being both asexual and mentorial). Indeed, this was really the first time that he saw me unambiguously as a woman. And as I've pointed out, maybe ad nauseam, the impact comes from not just the nudity but the fact that it's one-sided and that, simply on account of being female, I'm forbidden to wear clothes. So I knew it would take a few days for our old connection to be restored.<br><br>Marcia and Rebecca met us as we left the arrivals lounge. That Marcia took time away from her busy schedule to greet a student may have been penance for the terse welcome I had received on my first day. Rebecca had, I assume coincidentally, just come in on a charter flight and waited with Marcia. The two women's appearance startled Daniel despite his having seen them bare-breasted during our video conferences. They are a generation older than him, and senior academics, so the jolt he received beholding them was even more profound than what he felt with me.<br><br>The six of us shared a taxi into the city. Taking their seats in the taxi, despite their somewhat seductive striptease Monique and Kris showed in their faces and their gestures the same feelings I had experienced on my first day, right down to the embarrassed gasp of pleasure when their bare bottoms first touched the upholstery. They had just come from a symposium on public health policy (strategies for promoting physically active and healthy lifestyles). The conference had adjourned for a restart on Palmira with some of the attendees, to study the unique culture and its prospects for "wellness tourism". (I hadn't known that was even a thing.) They were flying in a couple of days ahead of the others. Around two-thirds of the full group were females, and I heard later that they made quite a splash during their visit. (I've read since in the conference proceedings that a recommendation had been made for greater promotion of similar resorts to Palmira's, but these will never have the same exotic flavor. And I don't think there will ever be a male equivalent of the nude law. The world doesn't work that way.)<br><br>Meanwhile, sharing the seats with five naked women while taking in the unique scenery of Robina and RÃ©gate, Daniel was suffering, and savoring, the sensory overload which Brandon, Rebecca's assistant, had described. He never said a word during the entire journey.<br><br>Yet by the end of the week Daniel had seen and interacted with enough nudity that it was no longer a novelty or a distraction. Nevertheless, like Sean he enjoyed the company of unclothed women. That seems a case of stating the obvious, but Australia is very much a "bloke culture" where young guys don't socialize much with the womenfolk. That said, he never played on his privilege. By this I mean he never considered himself special or superior because unlike us (Rebecca, Marcia, myself) who were his supervisors, he was permitted to cover his body. Indeed, he treated me with discernibly more deference to my femininity than before -- not just being chivalrous but respecting the fact that I have the strength and self-confidence to reveal myself so completely, proclaiming and celebrating my womanhood, being proud of what I am and having no pangs about what I'm not.<br><br>He spent his free time during the first two days of his visit with Monique and Kris. They made their farewells when I took him to CimarrÃ³n Bay. We walked there, in heavy rain the entire way. He wrapped himself in a waterproof poncho which kept him mostly dry but, though lightweight, made him sweat. I wasn't allowed such protection, of course, but while the downpour was heavy enough to slightly sting my skin it was warm, so on balance I suffered no more than Daniel.<br><br>When we arrived the site was waterlogged, so he did not get to observe any work that day. He stayed with the rest of us at the hostel and was both amused and bemused by the attitude and antics of the concierge. After just getting used to me being nude, he had to cope with the fact that his mentor and Sue the site manager were treated like naughty schoolgirls. He discovered that, at least here in the sergeant-major's domain, the privilege of his penis extended beyond the right to wear clothes. As I've said, no one takes Albert's authoritarian antics too seriously; but I must confess that I found Daniel's amusement to be a little irksome.<br><br>He stayed on Palmira for another week and a half, and took part in the actual fieldwork. It didn't surprise me when he signed up for next season's dig session. Even if he hasn't admitted it, getting dirty in a ditch with a bunch of naked females was not disagreeable to him.<br><br>Sadly, things did not work out quite so well with Matthew. During my previous expeditions, when I spoke to my boyfriend via video link, sometimes I would take off my top, or even strip all the way, for some long-distance dalliance. In my first three months on Palmira nothing changed in this respect, although of course I now didn't need to take anything off. He commented that I was browner all over. However, when we reunited at Robina airport, I could see he was rattled by how comfortable and casual I was with my public nudity. He didn't appreciate men looking at those parts of my body which he regarded as his exclusive domain. He stayed for ten days, and things after that were not as they had been. We haven't officially broken up, but I am uncertain about our future.<br><br>I flew back to Australia for Christmas, and after six months it felt strange to be wearing clothes, to have fabric next to my skin instead of the warm, fresh, caressing Caribbean air. My family noticed, although only Grandma really understood. Yet I felt no urge to bare myself, did not seek out a local "free beach". Some cultural practices do not translate.<br><br>Oddly enough, my attitude to clothing itself had changed. As I've mentioned, I have never been particularly "feminine" in my style choices -- by no means "butch" but certainly not "girly-girl". Being used to spending so much of my time in fieldwork, I generally dressed for comfort -- jeans and shorts on campus, dungarees on the dig site. When I did wear a dress or a skirt, I never really thought about the genderized nature of clothing. Women wear frocks, show legs, bare shoulders and display cleavage; it's not something you bother to analyze. But my experience of life on Palmira has altered that part of me. I guess the most apt equivalent to what I've become is a "lipstick feminist". I have come to embrace feminine clothing as empowering -- yes because it is sexy, but more because it's distinctively female. It's a choice I've made, not a convention I've adopted.<br><br>The first member of my family to comment on my new image was my brother, who has always teased me about being a tomboy. He was the one person I had been reluctant to inform about my going to Palmira, because I was sure he'd make jokes about it. (He did, but none are worth repeating.) Now he acknowledged my conversion.<br><br>"Hey everyone," he exclaimed. "I've just realized something. Kate's a girl!"<br><br>"Always have been," I snapped back.<br><br>"But who knew?" was his retort.<br><br>Before going back to Palmira, I presented a guest lecture to a roomful of colleagues and students on the progress of archaeological and anthropological research on the island. After some consideration I included a slideshow which did not hold back on the nudity, including my own. I was more nervous than I'd ever been giving a talk of this nature. During the presentation my audience remained silent, but that was out of politeness and gave no indication of what everyone was thinking. Yet during the question-and-answer session, when the back-and-forth stuck to the science, I thought we were having an "emperor's new clothes" situation. (That's when they see everything but say nothing.) But then came some good-natured exchanges about the obvious. It must be remembered that enlightened historians are not judgemental about exotic customs and lifestyles. Even so, the most probing questions came from women, who appeared intrigued rather than shocked or censorious.<br><br>I returned to Palmira in the new year for the start of another dig season. I flew in with a contingent of undergraduate students from various Australian universities, who were on a study holiday. The journey was a long haul via Los Angeles and Miami. When we touched down at the Robina airport everyone was tired, but keyed up. For me, it felt good to be back.<br><br>Nevertheless, Palmira loves its quirks. We arrived on Perihelion Day, the fourth of January. This is an observance marking the Earth's closest approach to the Sun during its year-long orbit. While the locals insist it is an old tradition, I'm skeptical of the claim. (I believe it was invented as a tourist gimmick.) There are various ways to celebrate the occasion, but what it meant for us disembarking female passengers was that even the tarmac is, on this day, hallowed ground. So we had to undress while still on board the plane, rather than in the terminal. The female flight attendant announced this and then led the way, handing her cast-off garments to her male colleague. After that the passengers followed, we knowbies inspiring the newbies. Still, stripping was a difficult feat within the narrow confines of the crowded cabin. The males helpfully remained sitting while we disrobed in the aisle.<br><br>The girls in my group stood silently agog and agape as they watched me so calmly denuding myself. They weren't naÃ¯ve or ignorant, but I was not just a travelling companion, I was their de facto leader. They were, as with most newcomers to Palmira, still stuck in the clothing-equals-status mentality. But I didn't need to say anything. As the first girl, a tall, athletic blond named Simone, began unbuttoning her blouse I nodded and smiled, and the others emulated her. We bumped and jostled each other as we stripped. So to minimize the congestion in the aisle, we turned towards the seats, which meant I was facing Callum, who had sat next to me, by the window, during the flight. My belly was at his eye level, and he tried to stare diligently straight ahead (but did not turn away to look out the window, I noticed) as I peeled off my blouse, my skirt, my underwear, folding each item and placing it in a neat stack on the seat beside him.<br><br>Once we were naked, everyone filed down the steps accompanied by the mesmerized males. And as we crossed the tarmac, we carried our clothes in a manner that didn't conceal any part of our natural beauty. All of the women from the plane did this automatically, and I think the early divesture helped in this respect. By the time we reached the terminal there were no hunched bodies or downcast eyes... though there were flushed faces, raised nipples and a few giggles.<br><br>After leaving the airport, we took two taxis to the hotel in downtown RÃ©gate, where my group were booked in for two nights. On the way, I studied how the girls came to terms with their public exposure. It is always the same. In fact, when I think about it, my own feelings haven't really changed. The wonderful thing about Palmira is that you never get blasÃ© about your nudity. You see the expressions on the faces of newly arrived women. Then there are your own responses to all sorts of situations and challenges. When a man's gaze lingers longer than what's considered polite. When goosebumps stipple your flesh and you're not allowed to cover up. When you exercise. (Back home I always wore a sports bra when jogging or doing calisthenics, for comfort and to prevent long-term sagging. On Palmira I support my breasts with my hands; but I have to cup them from underneath so my nipples aren't hidden from view.) Every time you sit down you feel the texture of the seat against your bare back and bottom, and you're reminded that there is nothing between your most intimate parts and the world. (Palmirenes have a somewhat inconvenient liking for wicker chairs. These leave a lasting impression.)<br><br>So everything has consequences. Even the simplest acts have rules and conventions. Take that simple act of sitting. You could write a book on it. You've learnt as a girl how to sit correctly in a skirt. But Palmirenes frown at a woman who crosses her legs (and arms, although crossing ankles is acceptable), because they see it as a way of shielding yourself. You naturally hunch over when your legs are crossed (because you've made your backside a narrower and less stable base). Therefore, with your legs uncrossed you sit up straighter. This looks more elegant and it gives your breasts more display. Knees can be touching, but not pressed tightly together. Proper posture projects pride.<br><br>In your first days here, I found out, the worst thing you can do is try to cover yourself with your hands. (It's illegal to use anything else, like a bag or a hat or a towel, even if only habitual offenders will be busted for it.) That just draws attention to yourself; and it doesn't change the fact that you're naked; it just shows that you're ashamed. But you're apt to overcompensate. When you walk you tend to keep your hands busy, or clasped behind your back, as if to prevent them from converging, by reflex, over forbidden places. However, as you become more at ease with your nudity you loosen up. You start to enjoy the attention you receive.<br><br>That's important. Your experience is not all internal. People are watching you -- not everyone, but those who do usually don't try to hide it. You take pleasure in being looked at, though not in being stared at. You give permission to look, but it's not necessarily an invitation. You don't accept leering. You expect respect.<br><br>What I've found on Palmira is that I love being around men, and it's not solely because of the attention. They are clothed, simply because they are male, and their clothing separates them from me because I'm female. So even when I sometimes become less mindful of my naked state, the very sight of clothing is a cue which brings me back to full awareness, not just of my undressed condition but of the fact that I'm a woman. When such a potent symbol of our public sexuality, how much and what sort of clothing is worn, has been eliminated, what's left are the distilled essences -- pure masculinity and pristine femininity. (Who would have predicted a year and a half ago that I would make a statement like that? Certainly not I!)<br><br>The girls in the group learned this during their stay in RÃ©gate, during the hike across the island, and especially during their time at CimarrÃ³n Bay. So did the guys. Females on-site now outnumbered the males by nearly three to one. And for the young men it must have seemed a perfect paradise to be surrounded by naked women, living, working, playing alongside them. Indeed, for the first (and only) time, I had envious thoughts. You rarely get to experience a fantasy come true like theirs. And being the sex permitted to wear clothing must create a huge boost to the ego, as a proud reaffirmation of their manhood as much as our nudity is an assertion of our womanhood.</div>
        <div id="chapter10" class="chapter-content">
Healthy and safety are taken very seriously on any archaeological site. Nevertheless, mishaps happen. Towards the end of my first dig session, a minor misadventure resulted in a badly sprained wrist and a nasty gash above my right eye.<br><br>To record each day's progress we take photographs of the trenches from a rather high, normally stable stepladder. What happened was nobody's fault, just a freak accident. One foot of the ladder rested on a rock which somehow became dislodged. I took a dive into the dirt. Our first aid officer Alice patched me up on-site, but insisted on a more thorough examination for a possible concussion. While the island's main hospital is in Grandin, I was taken to a medical centre in RÃ©gate, and despite my protests was kept there overnight for observation.<br><br>As I've mentioned previously, the nude law is not enforced in health care institutions. Indeed all medical personnel, both sexes, are clothed, more or less. But Palmirene traditions are not ignored. Tribute must still be paid to la diffÃ©rence. Female staff -- doctors, nurses, orderlies, administrators, technical personnel and so on -- wear short, wrap-around dresses (designed for quick and easy removal, I presume) with nothing underneath.<br><br>As for female patients, the nurse told me that it's up to each whether to remain naked. I couldn't see the point of putting anything on for my short stay. My attending physician was a handsome young gent from Grenada. I'd been half-naked in front of male doctors before Palmira, but it felt just a little bit creepy to be lying on the bed, my entire body uncovered while he inspected my head and wrist and clinically ignored the rest. That night I slept with a sheet on top of me. It was an open ward, and in the bed next to mine was Richard, a tourist who had fallen off his quad bike. We chatted and he happily admitted that his misfortune occurred because he wasn't paying attention to the traffic but rather to the roadside scenery (of the human female variety, of course). In the morning I dispensed with my covering, and he was rather taken aback because I was the only naked woman in the place. But shortly afterwards his wife arrived.<br><br>I was a little surprised that the woman was about six months pregnant; but I really shouldn't have been. The awesome natural beauty of the pregnant form is no more gloriously displayed than in the nude, like a fertility goddess. And what better place than Palmira to showcase a woman at the peak of her feminine power, unhampered by clothing which disguises the wonderful transformation taking place in her body? Nevertheless, the wife came into the ward wearing a short chemise. She must have assumed that this was the protocol, because as soon as she saw me sitting up in bed with nothing on she grinned and removed it.<br><br>The director of the hospital is a woman, and each day she visits the clinic and performs patient rounds. After she had stopped by Richard's and my beds, she conferred with the young doctor and they continued talking as they walked out onto the verandah which connects the ward with the administration offices. As soon as they stepped into the sunlight, without missing a beat the woman took off her smock and continued her conversation naked.<br><br>This experience was, for me, a reminder that one of the ways you get seduced by the nude law is, ironically, through how, when and where it doesn't apply. For example, it is not illegal to cover your body out of public sight -- as in your private quarters. Back home I sometimes slept in the nude, usually when sharing the bed with Matthew. In the CimarrÃ³n "barracks", on my first night I waited to see Alice's bedtime practice. I didn't want to infringe on her comfort zone. It wasn't a problem; she slept naked. We didn't even bother with a sheet or blanket because the place is warm even in what counts on Palmira as winter.<br><br>The RÃ©gate boarding house where I stay is owned and run by a middle-aged couple. Francesca has not worn a stitch of clothing on her body for almost her entire life, and like most of her compatriots doesn't understand why a woman would want or need to cover up. So the rule for residents is that women must be nude at all times; and though that's impossible to enforce in the private rooms, I am anyway. In other words, even in circumstances when you're permitted to cover yourself, you don't. It's not just about how you appear to other people; it's about your own feelings.<br><br>I shall go back to a statement I made earlier and amend it slightly. We dress or undress to influence perceptions of us; but that includes our own perceptions, even when no one is looking. Your state affects the way you think, feel and behave in private as well as in public. And I have discovered that the confidence, the empowerment and the sheer joy of being naked don't fade when I'm alone. It's still me and my body. I want to hold onto those feelings. Anyway, it would be a bizarre inversion of outside-world norms to be nude in public and clothed in private.<br><br><p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br></p>I have probably gone on long enough about Palmira, but there are still some observations to make about this extraordinary place.<br><br>One of the driving forces here behind modern attitudes to women's nudity has been tourism. Vacationing females easily outstrip males in numbers (weak pun intended) which is partly a result of government policy to limit arrivals and maintain a "wholesome" image. Only visitors with pre-booked accommodation are allowed overnight stays onshore; and since the demand is high and the number of hotel rooms limited, preference is given to certain categories, in particular couples. Single females are more likely to gain entry than single males, and all-female or mixed-sex groups than all-male parties. Until a couple of years ago, a cruise ship company ran tours from neighboring islands which were heavily patronized by men and became known as "voyeurges" (a clumsy but accurate term). Similar operations still exist, but on a much smaller scale and subject to severe restrictions. University students on spring or summer break are discouraged, though not banned. Graduates celebrating the completion of their studies, like the party of seven I met on the hike to CimarrÃ³n Bay, tend to be less boisterous and more acceptable.<br><br>Palmira has also become a major player in wedding tourism, a lucrative and rapidly growing sector of the international travel market. Its appeal is the combination of wedding and honeymoon. In a very competitive industry worldwide, tourist destinations are hard to differentiate, so they must focus on something that makes them notable. In the Caribbean region, there are so many commonalities that it's hard for any place to stand out. But Palmira has a ready-made distinction. The island adds a special, indeed unique flavor to the wedding experience.<br><br>Among the first people I met on my original flight to Palmira were the honeymooning couple. About one in ten of all visitors are newlyweds, and an equal number are spouses renewing their vows. Couples coming to get married are still a small minority. Not all family and friends can travel so far or are willing to abide by Palmira's rules; and for this reason partners on their second or subsequent marriage outnumber the first-timers. The exceptions are lesbian couples. (Palmira is a progressive society. Weddings can be religious or secular. Same-sex marriage is legal. Commitment ceremonies are treated with the same respect as traditional marriages.)<br><br>One Saturday afternoon I and two of my colleagues, Sophie and Oscar, witnessed a wedding in a RÃ©gate park. The couple were accompanied by about two dozen guests. The groom wore an outfit appropriate for the tropics, an open-neck shirt and blazer, cream slacks and brogues. The bride's full ensemble consisted of a silver tiara, a silk tulle veil and ivory heeled sandals. Her complexion was fair, but she must have prepared for her big day. She had made sure that no tan lines spoiled the seamless sheen of her body.<br><br>It was a civil ceremony and the officiant was a woman. Needless to say, she, the bridesmaid and the female guests were also nude. (The perennial dilemma of choosing bridal gowns and bridesmaids' dresses -- and fitting into them -- is avoided on Palmira.) The couple's vows included the declaration, "I offer to you all that I have, I give to you all that I am." This had symbolic resonance when, just before they exchanged rings, they performed a little ritual. As they stood facing each other, he removed her tiara and veil, and she took off her shoes, so that she entered married life completely bare, even more so than when the nuptials began. She was both opening up and offering herself completely to her man. As they were pronounced husband and wife, all that she wore, from head to foot, was the ring he'd placed on her finger.<br><br>It was a lovely gesture, with genuine meaning, unlike some of the more archaic traditions you witness at weddings. Their vows were identical. The bride didn't promise to "love, honor and obey" her lord and master.<br><br>Sophie and I had stopped to watch, while Oscar waited patiently. Sophie, from California, was at the time engaged to Corinne, a professor at UCLA. She made up her mind that Saturday to get married on Palmira. Corinne, who had had been a campaigner for same-sex marriage in their home state, wed her first partner in San Francisco back in 2004. (And as someone once said, I'm sure, marriage equality becomes real in the divorce court.)<br><br>They tied the proverbial knot at Bonaire, a picturesque village on the north-east coast, in December -- on my birthday, in fact. (I flew out for Christmas with my family a few days later.) Corinne is a tall, slim, attractive redhead, a few years older than Sophie's 25 years. I must admit that I found her manner somewhat abrupt. She's a no-nonsense, lay-it-on-the-line woman, in contrast to Sophie who's sweet-tempered and free-spirited. I met Corinne at their pre-wedding party, and wasn't sure how she was adapting to Palmira's ways. But if she had any misgivings they did not show.<br><br>Guests of both sexes had flown in, and the women were at first understandably disoriented. However, they adapted quickly. Nevertheless the party was a rather sedate affair until the arrival of a pair of male strippers. I was surprised by that, even though the dudes disrobed only as far as their chamois loincloths, whereas the majority of their audience had started out with less. As a result the act was an anticlimax, but afterwards the revelers grew more confident, spontaneous and fancy-free. That night the Esplanade rocked.<br><br>The following day, as a nod to tradition and a hint of their relationship, Sophie was attended by a maid of honour -- that was me -- while Corinne was accompanied by a best woman. There were no fathers of the bride present, but in any case no one was giving anyone away. Their only accoutrements were Sophie's veil and Corinne's floral coronet, which they duly removed for a fully naked embrace, an enchanting symbol of their union. The celebrant did not pronounce them wife and wife but instead finished with "I now pronounce you joined in marriage." The reception was low-key, a garden party with no speeches and no bouquet-tossing.<br><br>It should go without saying (but I shall say it anyway, because it's my curse) that any misconceptions about lesbians were dispelled that day. Sophie and Corinne did not disguise their femininity. They laid bare their womanhood, literally. And it was more heartfelt because you might not think that someone like Corinne would be comfortable with her required nudity. Yet she reacted no differently from any other woman coming to Palmira for the first time. So if there's a lesson to be learnt, it's that gay women don't want to be men. And what better place than Palmira to teach it?<br><br>In any case, I was touched by the simplicity and elegance of both of these weddings. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this (and maybe I've spent too much time on Palmira), but I love the idea of the bride being naked. What she wears on her wedding day should be an extension or reflection of her real, natural self, what she is taking into the marriage. This is her gift to her husband (or with Sophie and Corinne, to each other); it is an affirmation and an assertion of her womanhood and her sexuality. It represents her femininity; and by definition nothing is more feminine than the female body. Indeed, I've always thought that extravagant wedding gowns miss this point; they are more about fantasy (fairy-tale princess, anyone?) than reality. By contrast, revealing -- in some cases very revealing -- wedding gowns have become popular in many parts of the world, including Australia, because women are choosing the dress that expresses their actual personality. It may be sexy, sophisticated, glamorous, glittering, daring, demure, winsome, whatever. A fully naked bride may then be considered ne plus ultra -- the ultimate, nothing else beyond -- in her emancipation from anachronism.<br><br>On that note I shall finish off, with one last analysis. If there is one way in which I have been profoundly changed by life on Palmira, I nominate feeling pride in being female. Before Palmira I would have dismissed that sentiment, like taking pride in being born with brown eyes. Whatever you are or want to be, I would have said, to be proud of something that's outside your self-determination is vacuous. Now I think differently. We live in a world where, by and large, females are constantly reminded -- not by everyone but too often -- that we do not and should not have autonomy over our own bodies, that we don't belong to ourselves, that even our self-esteem is controlled by others. That might appear to be the case on Palmira, but I have learnt otherwise. The nude law is a liberation, not an imposition.<br><br>In a very important way Palmira's is an enlightened society. Women and girls here show a healthy, positive attitude towards their bodies, are more self-confident and more comfortable with our sexuality, more self-accepting with regard to body image than those of our sex elsewhere, and more than males. Because we hide nothing, we learn that there is no such thing as the "perfect" body. Everyone looks at you but no one judges you. People have seen everything (and I mean that in both senses). This is a culture in which commercial and peer pressures don't make us feel we have to look like a Barbie doll or a supermodel.<br><br>Palmirenes suffer from remarkably few eating disorders. Anorexia, bulimia, obesity are virtually unknown. At the risk of generalizing: these often arise because a woman or girl experiences herself and her body as separate entities, and she forces herself to control the body she dislikes, making it in her mind an object that is alien and unwanted. If her body is objectified, it's worse when she objectifies it herself. I don't think this happens much on Palmira because you cannot separate your physical body from your essential being. (And men, set this example, are also healthy.)<br><br>In most Western cultures, the prevailing view of the naked female body is a detrimental mixture of titillation and shame. To take one example, if a mother breast-feeds her baby in public, this is often treated as improper behaviour, rather than what it is, a perfectly natural and wonderful thing. And yet women's bodies are used to sell everything from cars to cola drinks. In other parts of the world it's the opposite but no better. So womankind is caught between the bikini and the burkha. And the only escape, if it's allowed, is to adopt masculine habits, clothing, hairstyles, mannerisms, values -- that is, to deny or repudiate one's femininity, one's own being. You cannot do that on Palmira. You come to terms with what you are, and with what you're not.<br><br>Nevertheless, in celebrating difference Palmirenes have addressed the issue of gender identity. It's very simple. If you have breasts and a vagina, however you identify yourself, you must not conceal them. If you have a penis, you must wear pants.<br><br>As I've stated before, Palmira is not perfect, it's no utopia. What makes this place unique is that the people believe that the expression of natural femininity should not be constrained by what are no more than contrived notions of status, gravitas, decorum, morality, modesty, shame. So women, far from being victimized or objectified by the nude law, are empowered by it. Palmira turns on its head the all-too-common notion that femininity is weakness. Palmirenes believe that you have to be strong, smart and self-confident to openly express your true self.<br><br>That is what I have found. Through the joy of nudity I have discovered a new sense of pride in my womanhood, in my natural beauty.<br><br>And so my story is coming to an end, at least for now. I have taken up the option of extending my fellowship for a second year and have been promoted to the position of site manager at Hamilton Bay. It's a smaller-scale excavation than CimarrÃ³n but with lots of potential. Daniel has returned but Matthew is unlikely to be back. That's probably for the best. I'm ambivalent about my brother, who has announced plans to come over. He says it's to visit the home of our ancestors; but since he's bringing his girlfriend I doubt that his motives are purely nostalgic. I'm not sure how I will feel about my Baby Bro seeing me naked; but that's not been an issue for generations of Palmirene big sisters.<br><br>I have been back and forward between Australia and Palmira several times. It's always good to go home, but when I return my skin tingles and I feel a tickle below my belly when I read that sign in big red letters --

        <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align: center;">NUDE LAW FAQ<br><br>
Palmira Department of Social Policy and Women's Affairs</p>
Q. Is nudity compulsory for all females?<br><br>A. Except in the special enclave (see below), nudity is compulsory for all adult females, resident and visitor. The law does not apply to girls under eighteen years of age and is not enforced for women over sixty.<br><br>Q. Are there any other exemptions?<br><br>A. Only if nudity poses a threat to your physical safety or general wellbeing. An application for exemption can be made in person at any office of the Palmira Tourist Bureau, any government agency or any police station. Enforcement will be suspended in emergencies such as storms. Otherwise, exemptions are very rare.<br><br>Q. Can I apply for an exemption before my trip to Palmira?<br><br>A. No; you may only apply in person after your arrival. However, you can make enquiries before leaving home by contacting the Palmira Tourist Bureau.<br><br>Q. What about pregnant women?<br><br>A. There is nothing more natural and beautiful than a pregnant woman. Why cover it up, as if it were a shameful thing?<br><br>Q. Is there male nudity?<br><br>A. No; male nudity is prohibited. The nude law celebrates the natural beauty of the female body.<br><br>Q. Can I wear anything at all?<br><br>A. Outdoors footwear and headgear are acceptable. A few other accessories are permitted, provided they do not cover any part of your torso, your legs above your knees or your arms above your elbows. Nothing else is allowed without an official exemption.<br><br>Q. When do I take off my clothes?<br><br>A. When you arrive at your disembarkation point, the air or sea terminal, you're expected to remove all your clothing immediately. You may not leave the premises unless you are naked.<br><br>Q. What happens if I wear clothes?<br><br>A. If you refuse to remove your clothes, you will be reported to the police. If you still don't comply, you will be arrested and ordered to strip. If you continue to refuse, you will be held in custody at the police station or under house arrest at your hotel until you are deported. No one will forcibly remove your clothing.<br><br>Q. What if I'm shy?<br><br>A. Keep in mind that nature gave you this wonderful female body. Be proud of it, celebrate it, show it off and enjoy the attention.<br><br>Q. Am I in danger of being harassed or molested?<br><br>A. Palmira has a strictly enforced hands-off policy. It is a criminal offence to grope, fondle or in any other way harass or interfere with you. While it is not illegal to take photographs or videos of you, these cannot be published without your permission. If anyone takes advantage of your nudity, do not hesitate to make a complaint to the police.<br><br>Q. What if I am not very attractive?<br><br>A. Both men and women love to see us naked. Beautiful bodies may receive the most attention, but don't worry, you will get your share. If the locals don't seem too interested in you, that is because they're used to seeing naked women. Your fellow guests will more than make up for that!<br><br>Q. Am I allowed to cover up in cold weather?<br><br>A. Our island is a tropical paradise. Don't worry about the cold. However, the law does not make allowance for unusually cool temperatures. You will cope. Anyway, goosebumps can be sexy. Enjoy it!<br><br>Q. Do I shave my pubic hair?<br><br>A. We have a tradition, which is not always followed, that single women do while married women don't. Unshaven legs and armpits are seen as very unattractive.<br><br>Q. What about feminine hygiene products?<br><br>A. All products must be worn internally (such as tampons). Nothing must cover the external parts of your genitalia (for example, pads). If you need to apply for an exemption, see above.<br><br>Q. Where is nudity not enforced?<br><br>A. In the privacy of your house or hotel room, you may wear clothing, if you really want to. The nude law is not enforced in places of worship, schools, hospitals and other medical clinics. The town of Grandin, on the west coast, is a special enclave with its own by-laws, where nudity is optional. Here most of Palmira's families have their homes.<br><br>Q. Is nudity permitted in the Grandin enclave?<br><br>A. Female nudity is permitted and accepted in all parts of Palmira. Most women in Grandin do not cover up.<br><br>Q. Is there anything else I need to know?<br><br>A. Anything that covers or conceals any part of your body, intentionally or otherwise, is legally defined as clothing and is therefore prohibited. If you have long hair, it must not cover your breasts. You must not carry or hold any object in a way that hides your nudity. Bed linen, towels and blankets must be used only for their specified purpose and not as de facto clothing.<br><br>Q. Is the nude law just a tourist gimmick?<br><br>A. There's no doubt that the nude law helps promote tourism; but keep in mind that Palmira is a natural holiday destination and does not need gimmicks any more than other Caribbean island resorts. More to the point, however, the nude law has existed in some form for 300 years, long before the tourist industry had any impact on the economy.<br><br>Q. Isn't the nude law sexist?<br><br>A. What most troubles critics of the nude law is that it allegedly discriminates against one sex with no reciprocal obligation on the other. This is a specious argument. Palmirene women have not only achieved equality but are now entrenched in positions of power and influence. Yet equal rights do not mean equal treatment, nor equal obligation.<br><br>"Striving for equality does not mean aspiring to sameness. Here we value equity -- ensuring justice and fairness, allowing every person the appropriate opportunities to lead a full, healthy life. To this end, we as a society must understand and acknowledge our differences; but when we have achieved equity we can celebrate those differences. So equal rights do not mean exactly the same treatment or obligations under the laws. And in this respect, here in Palmira men and women are definitely not equal. The beauty of the female body is esteemed above all else. As women, it is our right and our privilege to honour what nature has given us, by never hiding it away." (The Honourable Jennifer Hibbert, Chief Minister of Palmira)

        <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">PALMIRA EXPOSED</p>
        The origin of the name "Palmira" (pal-MEER-a) is obscure. While it obviously refers to palm trees, when and how it was first adopted remains a mystery. A recently discovered map shows the name already in use in the early 1600s, in the Spanish form, Palmeras. Place names, such as RÃ©gate and Grandin, are mostly derived from the French heritage. The accepted adjective is "Palmirene" (pal-MEER-een). The variants "Palmiran" and "Palmirian" fell out of common usage in the late nineteenth century.<br><br>In pre-Columbian times, Palmira was inhabited by a succession of peoples. Between sixteen- and twelve-hundred years ago, the island was occupied via waves of migration from South America. These populations have left their legacy in coastal burial sites which have yielded pottery showing several different cultural styles. They introduced maize and cassava, and took part in an extensive cotton trading network. By the year 1000 the relatively peaceful Arawak (or Taino) people had settled, but were later conquered by the warlike Caribs. The latter successfully resisted attempts at colonization by the Spanish and French until the mid-1600s. Decimated by war and disease, the Caribs have since disappeared as a distinct ethnic group.<br><br>European settlement was slow and disorganized. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Palmira was a haven for Caribbean pirates in the tradition of such notorious buccaneer strongholds as Petit Goave and Tortuga. Many of its residents hailed from Jamaica's Port Royal, either fugitives who had decamped following the crackdown on piracy by the English authorities in 1687, or refugees from the town's destruction by earthquake five years later. The island offered a good anchorage and fresh water supplies, and was ideally situated for attacks on shipping and settlements throughout the region.<br><br>Colonial rivalries at the time proved a bonanza for the Caribbean region's "wicked lairs of thieves, cutthroats and whores." Nevertheless, by the year 1700 piracy appeared to be on the wane. As the volume of bullion shipped back to Europe from the New World declined, so did the number of treasure ships on which to prey. The maritime powers, in particular England and France, had already been reducing their dependence on privateers like Henry Morgan and William Kidd, who were regarded as at best unreliable and too often downright treacherous. Naval squadrons based permanently in the West Indies now patrolled the sea lanes, and freebooting was increasingly viewed as a plague to be eradicated, rather than a pest to be tolerated and occasionally exploited.<br><br>However, the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 which brought an end to the War of the Spanish Succession unleashed upon the region thousands of unemployed seamen and soldiers, and many of these turned to piracy for their livelihood. This was a new golden age of buccaneering, when murderous rogues such as Blackbeard and Black Bart terrorized the seas. They became so emboldened as to attack towns and plantations on the shores of North America, in the Carolinas and as far north as Virginia. As well as material plunder, the pirates took hostages for ransom.<br><br>In 1715, a French-born adventurer, Christophe Peyrefitte, led a daring expedition from his base of operations on Palmira to pillage a number of major towns including Havana, and to raid the coasts of Florida and South Carolina. The boldness of his exploits made him, for a while, the most infamous of all the Caribbean swashbucklers, and the most hunted. In particular, the French government was stirred into action following assaults on its settlements in Hispaniola and on its Spanish allies in Cuba and Florida.<br><br>In 1720, Palmira was claimed by France and invaded. With their ships defeated and destroyed in a sea battle off Frigate Island, the pirate defenders withdrew to a fortified position overlooking their encampment at Regatta Bay. The French fleet bombarded the stronghold, and a force of soldiers and turncoat pirates disembarked nearby. Lacking land-based artillery, the French commander invested the fort in a siege which dragged on for weeks. All trees in the vicinity were chopped down to give the besiegers a clearer view of the enemy's defenses, but this proved counterproductive, as it removed cover for a surprise attack. Eventually, in the finest tradition of pirate perfidy, the citadel was betrayed from within. The final battle was ferocious, but the survivors were offered amnesty. They were permitted to remain on the island and quickly resumed their old ways, employed as mercenaries by the French in much the same manner that they and the English had once utilized the services of the privateers.<br><br>The resilient Peyrefitte had come through the fighting unscathed, and accommodated quickly to the new rÃ©gime. He ruled his tropical fiefdom with an iron fist, imposing order, promoting an esprit de corps which held together the rambunctious mob, and avoiding friction with the French authorities. One of the means he employed to keep his men in line was to provide them with wives, kidnapping women from nearby colonies and intercepted ships. Expecting a fate worse than death, these captive women were generally accorded decent treatment. Nonetheless, life on the island was arduous and unhealthy, at first. Conditions were primitive, disease rife, food in short supply, medical facilities non-existent. But as conditions gradually improved the women adapted. Their children were assimilated into the buccaneer culture. Sons followed in the footsteps of their fathers, and even some daughters, such as Peyrefitte's beautiful, dauntless descendant Ãlisabeth. While few modern Palmirenes can authentically trace their heritage back so far, almost every native claims one of these hardy females as an ancestor.<br><br>Christophe Peyrefitte ruled for another seven years until his assassination, in 1728, by one of his lieutenants. The renegade English naval officer Jonathan Rogers now assumed command. Distrustful of the Englishman, Paris dispatched a force to put down the anticipated rebellion; but the pragmatic Rogers proved his loyalty to his French overlords. Thereafter, under his ruthless but capable leadership, Palmira was transformed. The ramshackle village of RÃ©gate was rebuilt as a fully functioning town, with proper streets and a decent drainage system, a hospital and even a church. Roads were constructed connecting the capital with outlying settlements. The port's defenses were built up with formidable batteries of cannon placed on the hills overlooking Regatta Bay. To populate the community, soldiers and sailors were recruited from all over the Americas, mostly deserters and convicted criminals. Prostitutes were brought in from other islands and from the slums of Paris. African slavegirls were imported from neighboring West Indian colonies.<br><br>The most significant of his reforms was to overhaul the economy. Rogers understood that the days of unrestrained buccaneering were past. In Peyrefitte's time, raids on British and Dutch settlements had threatened to upset the uneasy relations among the colonial powers. Rogers substituted legitimate trade for commerce raiding, and drove out men reluctant to abandon their old ways. The former outlaws who stayed put their navigation and ship-repair skills to good use. A small but thriving boat-building industry developed, although this largely died out as the island became denuded of trees.<br><br>Jonathan Rogers died in 1739, of natural causes. Over the next several decades, the French contested British control in the Caribbean region. However, unlike many other islands during this tumultuous period, Palmira did not suffer invasion and despoliation. In 1763, as part of the political settlement following the Seven Years' War, it was one of those West Indian islands ceded to Britain. Despite half-hearted French recovery attempts during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period, Palmira would remain in the possession of the British Crown until almost the present day.<br><br>The Palmirans, having renounced their allegiance to France, remained faithful to their new colonial masters. In return, the British government pursued a policy of non-interference. The Governor of the Windward Islands supervised the island's affairs during the whole of the colonial period, but he rarely intervened. As a result, and on account also -- it must be conceded -- of the largely white population, Palmira enjoyed considerably more autonomy than its Caribbean neighbors, the islanders electing their own parliament. The population of around 2000 pursued agriculture and livestock-raising, as well as seafaring. Smuggling became an unofficial but important source of income. In the twentieth century, tourism emerged as the major source of revenue, and its main attraction is a legacy of the swashbuckling era.<br><br>That inheritance is, of course, female nudity, persisting in custom and enforced by law. The tradition remained intact at the height of the puritanical Victorian era and the more progressive Edwardian period. It survived the modernizing reforms and female emancipation of the twentieth century. Indeed, though it seems paradoxical to all but those familiar with local ways, the notorious nude law can be held responsible for the dramatic improvement in the status of women over the past few decades.<br><br>Yet its origins are obscure. According to local folklore, universal female nudity can be traced back to Christophe Peyrefitte's time. In a somewhat romantic version of events Lady Claudia Beresford, a beautiful Anglo-Irish noblewoman, was abducted en route to Jamaica circa 1715. Ending up in Peyrefitte's harem, she spurned the fine silk dresses offered by her captor, vowing that she would wear no clothing at all until she was freed. She never was, and she never did.<br><br>Although the woman of legend appears to be a composite of several characters, Claudia Beresford certainly existed. (She's my great-great-etcetera-grandmother.) A high-spirited girl, she had been sent abroad by her parents to end her affair with a married man. Following her alleged abduction -- which may in fact have been staged -- she was ransomed, but disowned by her family when found to be pregnant. Sent off to a convent, she shortly thereafter fled to Kingston, Jamaica, becoming a prostitute. She eventually ended up as Peyrefitte's concubine. Yet by 1720 Claudia had vanished. She may have died prior to the French occupation, or during the invasion. Whatever her fate, it has not been explained how or why her private vow to remain unclothed, assuming its historical veracity, should have created a lasting tradition.<br><br>A more plausible explanation for the nude law is that, during the Peyrefitte-Rogers era, Palmira's female population was sharply divided between slaves and free women.<br><br>Slavery, and in particular female servitude, was a mainstay of the island's economy long before the arrival of Europeans. Throughout the region the Caribs had traded in slaves, mainly women captured from the peaceful Arawak tribes. These were put to work in the fields growing cassava, to produce bread in times when grain was scarce. However, the introduction of African slaves and the European occupation ended the Caribs' dominance. In a short time, they were driven to near-extinction.<br><br>The African slave trade on Palmira was promoted by Jonathan Rogers, who saw the profits to be made from this lucrative enterprise as a way of diverting his men from piracy; but it quickly petered out. The buccaneers had always been an egalitarian lot. When taking over a slave ship, it was common practice to liberate the human cargo, who joined the crew. Indeed, many of the pirates were themselves runaway slaves, and any man of whatever race who knew the ropes -- was proficient in sailing skills -- was held in far higher esteem than any landsman who did not. This spirit of brotherhood survived the passing of the pirate age.<br><br>For this reason there had only ever been a few male slaves on Palmira. Since the islanders had always looked to the sea for their livelihood, a plantation system reliant on slavery never developed. What agriculture was possible, given the scarcity of fresh water, was based on small land holdings and a female work force. Thus, then the British Empire abolished the abominable institution in 1834, emancipation proceeded smoothly. This was in contrast to the upheavals in neighboring colonies, where indentured labor replaced slavery, merely substituting one form of servitude for another. On Palmira, the handful of freed male slaves were absorbed into the free population with little friction; and racial intermixing ever since that time has been so thorough that no native Palmirene today can claim to be entirely black or white, nor would want to do so.<br><br>It was different for the women. Enslaved females had endured oppression through their roles as both producers and reproducers. While their male counterparts were generally assigned jobs requiring skilled labor, such as carpentry, masonry and blacksmithing, the women bore a greater burden, toiling in the fields from sunrise to sunset, also providing sexual service and breeding children. There was no opportunity for the lighter duties of domestic service because Palmira had no leisured class. Indeed, the trend of women's improving status in the eighteenth century was reversed by the beginning of the nineteenth, with "free" women being treated as little more than house slaves.<br><br>Prior to 1834, all women were property with the same status as the handful of male slaves. However, a rudimentary caste system had developed, in which abducted women and their descendants were elevated above the prostitutes and paupers who had taken up the harsh life of Palmira and, at the bottom of the scale, those purchased on the slave markets. To distinguish them, it was decreed that the latter should be naked. In the wake of the Slavery Abolition Act, the emancipated slavewomen enjoyed only nominal freedom. But all women now had equivalent status and nudity soon became de rigueur for the entire female population. Eventually it was imposed by law and become the mark of all womanhood.<br><br>So in this account, female nudity was not universal on Palmira until well into the nineteenth-century; and what has become today an expression of liberation began as a symbol of oppression, applied first to the lowest rungs of society and gradually extended to all women. Despite tenuous links through the stories such as that of the obdurate Lady Claudia, there are no reports from the French occupiers in 1720 of nude women, something which would surely have been noted. A few naked slavegirls would have been overlooked, but not free and especially not white women. On the other hand, there is other evidence predating the French intervention which does appear to confirm that some sort of law was already in place. For instance, there is Charlotte Rosse's sojourn on Palmira.<br><br>While colourful scoundrels such as Christophe Peyrefitte and Jonathan Rogers dominate the official history, the most infamous and feared of all the pirates associated with Palmira was a member of the fairer -- if not gentler -- sex. Charlotte Rosse was born in Port Royal around 1675, the daughter of a shipwright who, like so many of his compatriots, turned to piracy to supplement his income. They joined the exodus following the great earthquake, and by the age of twenty the girl was serving aboard the sloop Diamond, under the command of an English pirate, Edwin Yancey. Foul-tempered and bloodthirsty, Yancey was also cowardly and treacherous.<br><br>According to another of the legends of which Palmirenes are so fond, Charlotte had been taken on disguised as a cabin boy. Inevitably, her sex was uncovered, literally. About to be raped, she struck first, wounding one of her attackers with his own dagger and firing off a shot which whistled past the captain's ear. Impressed by the woman's courage and determination, the men desisted. She was consigned to below decks as a scullery maid. Occasionally she would be forced to fight to defend her honour, but eventually she won the right to join the men in their freebooting activities, although not permitted a share of the loot.<br><br>In July 1700, the Diamond chased down a French merchantman off the coast of Hispaniola. At the last moment, Yancey apparently lost his nerve and veered away. He informed his aggrieved crew that he had sensed a trap, whereas in fact the spineless, superstitious commander had probably been spooked by a bad omen. There were grumblings and murmurings, but no one dared question his judgement; until, that is, one crewmember stepped forward. A lone female in the harsh world of men, Charlotte had learnt to take care of herself. Proficient with the pistol and the cutlass, she was brave to the point of foolhardiness. Now she defied her captain. When he ordered that she be cast into irons, she challenged him to a duel; but her skill with the sword was no match for his. As the entire crew looked on, Yancey methodically stripped her with his blade, cutting away parts of her clothing until she stood stark naked. As he moved in to claim his prize, however, she lunged with her sword and ran him through. Dumbfounded, he froze for a few seconds, staring at the young woman in surprise before collapsing lifeless onto the deck. The crew were awed, if not yet ready to accept a mere female as their new leader. But Charlotte reminded them of the matter of the French merchantman and swore that she would never pass up such opportunities for easy plunder. In the reckless, egalitarian culture of the pirates, this belligerent spirit counted for more than age, class, race or sex. The crew elected Charlotte Rosse to be their leader, and a legend was born.<br><br>Over the next few years, under their distaff commander the crew of the Diamond and its successor, the captured French man-of-war Duc de Bretagne, attacked virtually anything which sailed upon the seas. Such was her fearless and fearsome reputation that crews were known to abandon their vessels at the sight of Charlotte's banner. This was still the age of privateering and she hired herself and her crew to the Spanish, to harass English shipping off the coast of New Spain. But when she commenced attacking vessels belonging to the Spaniards' French allies, she was declared an outlaw and returned to outright piracy. Proclaiming allegiance to no nation, acknowledging no sovereign, respecting no flag, dreading no man, Charlotte Rosse embarked upon a rampage virtually unparalleled in boldness, even in the fierce annals of New World piracy.<br><br>Her most famous exploit was the capture of the aforementioned Duc de Bretagne in May of 1701. Though carrying more guns, the French vessel did not put up a fight after the initial salvo had toppled her mainmast. We are told that Charlotte employed a subterfuge to neutralize the enemy's superior firepower, but no reliable record exists of what this might have been. It does indicate that she used brains as well as brawn and bravado to overcome her foes. The Duc was commandeered and, fitted with no less than forty guns, spread havoc throughout in the region, until wrecked the following year in a violent storm off Trinidad.<br><br>The sole woman on board her ship, Charlotte scorned the attentions of all her crew, at least one of whom she shot for inappropriate advances. On the other hand, she took to her bed handsome men she had captured and was holding for ransom. At the same time, she was gaining a savage reputation. Terrified passengers and crew on doomed vessels would leap into the sea when her banner was unfurled. In exorcising her demons, Charlotte Rosse was becoming one.<br><br>Refitting a new ship, the Avenger, she continued to terrorize the populations of the coasts and islands and sea lanes of the Americas. On Easter Sunday, 1704, the Avenger sailed boldly into Jamaica's Kingston harbour. Charlotte was adamantly opposed to such a reckless act; but her crew, never fully reconciled to a woman as leader, had become sullen and mutinous, and they insisted on proceeding. The local authorities were intimidated and at first turned a blind eye; but after two days of carousing the men were either still drunk or suffering hangovers, and vulnerable to attack. In the ensuing dÃ©bÃ¢cle, those not cut down were captured and imprisoned. Charlotte's bid to go out fighting failed when she was overpowered. At her trial, she remained silently defiant and was hanged alongside her surviving comrades, in June 1704.<br><br>Charlotte's story has relevance to the nude law, as she and her crew are known to have spent time on Palmira. (A young Christophe Peyrefitte is believed to have served with her and stayed on the island after her departure, thus avoiding her fate.) That such a formidable female should bare her body for the entertainment of her shipmates and the men ashore seems highly unlikely. Yet there are several accounts (admittedly second- and third-hand) of her swaggering naked through the camp, dispatching any man crazy enough to try to take advantage of her dÃ©nudÃ© state. It is therefore possible that a nude law of some kind was already in place.<br><br>According to one report, Charlotte's fear-inducing flag featured a naked woman wielding a cutlass and a blunderbuss. So maybe she went about the island unclothed as a show of feminine pride and defiance, and perhaps this is how the tradition began.

        <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">PALMIRA UNCOVERED</p>
        Irrespective of its origins, by the mid-nineteenth century at the latest female nudity appears to have become universal on the island. Nevertheless, while the descriptions of occasional visitors and official records of the French and later British colonial authorities mention the naked women, even then there appears nowhere any reference to actual laws enforcing it. More likely, what happened was a gradual process. It may have been that the females went without clothing while their menfolk were at sea; although a rival conjecture is that they cast off their clothes to celebrate their men's homecoming. In any case, the custom may have become established to some degree by 1749. In that year Ãlisabeth Peyrefitte took to the sea as captain of her own vessel, a merchantman. She commanded her all-male crew stark naked... or so it is said. (Notwithstanding the statue of her standing naked at the helm, erected in RÃ©gate's main square, local historians dismiss the legend.)<br><br>Whenever the nude law actually came into effect, neither the French nor British colonial authorities made any attempt to nullify it. Any social campaigners who might have complained were dissuaded by the island community's social harmony, which was attributed by most observers to the nude law. As I've mentioned, there is a saying on Palmira: When all women are naked, all men know they are brothers.<br><br>Finally, it should be noted that the most radical interpretation of the nude law is that it was in fact a twentieth century phenomenon backdated by folk memory to the eighteenth. In this reconstruction, prior to 1906 female nudity was widespread but was neither compulsory nor universal. Travelers may have encountered both naked and clothed women, but naturally tended to emphasize the former in their descriptions. For instance, a visitor in 1874, Thomas Canavan (Letters from the Caribbean) mentioned female nudity but was coy about its prevalence. Though observant and preceptive, he was not immune to the racial prejudice of his day. He expressed surprise that white women were equally as "fancy-free" as their "darker sisters." Yet there is no hint in his report of disapproval. He noted that Palmirene women were among the most beautiful in the world. Romanticizing the old pirate custom of kidnapping their brides, he speculated that selective breeding and natural evolution had produced this delightful phenomenon. The buccaneers of old would, it was surmised, have carried off only the most comely females. Canavan wrote fifteen years after the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species.<br><br>What was less often mentioned in the records is that up until modern times, the tough, resilient females of Palmira enjoyed more rights than members of their sex elsewhere. Working on the farms and in the trades while the men were away, they exercised a considerable degree of independence; and although the island's parliament was a male-only institution, in the men's absence the women acted as decision-makers. So it may be that Palmira's females embraced nudity as an assertion of their womanhood, and perhaps as a tribute to the suffering and sacrifices of their mothers, grandmothers and ancestors.<br><br>So to sum up, there are several versions of the nude law's origins, and who's to say which is closest to the truth? For as Napoleon Bonaparte is supposed to have said, history is fable that we agree to believe.<br><br>What is historical fact is that only in 1906 was female nudity formally imposed by the Palmirene parliament. That was when the first such legislation was introduced, with its now famous raison d'Ãªtre -- "To honour the natural beauty of the female body, women are forbidden to wear clothing." Also in the preamble is the telling phrase "in accordance with our customs" with no mention of any precedent in actual law. Perhaps not surprisingly, this was the very time when the merchant aristocracy which had dominated local political and economic affairs for generations had begun to concede power to new breeds of entrepreneur, including the tourist operator. Thus the nude law, far from being an antique tradition, may be a relatively modern initiative, imposing by official decree a widespread but by no means universal practice.<br><br>Over the decades, the law was refined and clarified, the latest upgrade coming in 2009. Successive British administrators could have vetoed or repealed it, but none did so; and as a result enforcement was rigorous and sometimes brutal. The punishment for a woman wearing any form of clothing or covering any part of her body was generally a public caning. Even the wives and daughters of colonial officials were not exempt. Those refusing to abide by local custom were (and mostly still are) obliged to remain within the confines of Grandin's administrative and diplomatic compound.<br><br>In 1935, the senior British official in the colony, Commissioner Richard Penrose, was a bachelor who took a native wife. Following their retirement to England, the lovely Mrs Penrose astonished and delighted staff and guests at their country manor house, clad only in what nature had provided.<br><br>By the 1950s, word of the "island of naked women" had filtered out to the world. A rising tide of tourists began to upset tradition. To attract investors and improve the island's image, the government began to relax the nude law for visitors. Tensions mounted; and the first of the so-called stripping riots took place in 1958, when a mob of infuriated locals attacked a group of British holiday-makers at Bonaire, on the north-east coast. A number of women were disrobed and dunked in the ocean. This and subsequent such actions were peaceful and light-hearted, and the victims of the Bonaire incident took it in good humour. However, in 1962 an ugly incident at Bretache, north of RÃ©gate, almost erupted into violence. The government belatedly cracked down on vigilantism, but also decreed a more strict enforcement of the law.<br><br>Even today there are female visitors who are unfamiliar with local history and custom, and a number who for some reason believe they're exempt. Until the introduction of the latest version of the law in 2009, women falling foul of the rules could be disrobed after a formal warning. Nowadays, no one can be forcibly stripped, but penalties for non-compliance include deportation for foreigners and fines and community service for local women.<br><br>In the mid-1960s the tourist industry flourished. Female nudity appealed to jetsetters and trendsetters pursuing new experiences, to couples looking to spice up their relationship and to honeymooners seeking an exotic start to their marriage. In turn, the impact of tourism was at least partly responsible for the modernization of Palmirene society.<br><br>The island had long passed its heyday when Regatta Bay was a sea of sails and Palmirene crews manned a significant proportion of ships plying the Caribbean. Most men still earned their livelihood at sea, on fishing boats or freighters. However, tourism was overtaking all other industries in importance. More men stayed ashore and took up more sedentary occupations. The buccaneer culture died out, and the last vestiges of the patriarchy were swept away by winds of change. These brought an improvement in women's rights, initially at a gradual pace but eventually dramatic.<br><br>In the meantime, an attempt by the British government to weaken the nude law was a factor in the (mutually agreed) declaration of independence in 1974. The next step, albeit belated, was the extension of voting rights to women. Even so, it was not until 1989 that females were able to stand for election to Parliament; and one of the reasons why Palmira lagged behind its neighbors in sexual equality was the concern that women might vote for abolition of the nude law. This was to prove unfounded.<br><br>In 1979, Chief Minister Roger Haradine introduced a resolution in the Legislative Assembly for a reassessment of "antiquated" statutes. One of these was the nude law; but then a remarkable thing happened. Women began making themselves heard. The campaign to save the nude law started as a murmur of protest which quickly grew to a crescendo. What women feared was that the end of compulsion was the thin edge of a wedge. How long would it be before clothing became compulsory? Many had never worn a stitch in their entire adult lives. The expatriate community was no more in favour of repeal. Some women felt that to wear clothes would be a sign of disrespect towards males. Others believed that to abandon the nude law would dishonor the many generations of women, their forebears, who had struggled, survived and thrived without clothing.<br><br>As one protester summed up her position: "We are finally starting to enjoy the same rights that men have enjoyed for centuries. This is the time to celebrate our differences, not to hide them. If we are ashamed of our naked bodies, then we are in a sense disparaging our mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers who have borne their nudity with dignity and grace." This woman, Elizabeth Reynolds, would later be the first of her sex elected to the Palmirene parliament.<br><br>Others were even more forthright. The island's nascent feminist movement, to the surprise of many outsiders, firmly opposed repeal. Nudity was embraced not just as an expression and symbol but an assertion of womanhood. Progressive Palmirenes of both sexes could advocate for social and political reform while endorsing the nude law.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the men of Palmira joined their womenfolk in this crusade to defend Palmira's traditions and preserve the lifestyle. Unfortunately, some went further. Although only a handful of women challenged the law by wearing clothes, those who did were subjected to harassment. The pro-nudist camp, realizing that such attacks were counterproductive, called for calm. As a result, acknowledging the storm of protest which had remained mostly peaceful throughout, the parliament voted unanimously against repeal.<br><br>By this time women had won the right to vote but were still barred from running for election. It was largely in recognition of the leadership role they had taken in the campaign, and with the realization that they would not abrogate the nude law, that they soon achieved greater rights.<br><br>Thereafter, it was the tourist boom which ended whatever lingering doubts might have existed. Not only did the nude law not deter female visitors, they made up a majority of arrivals in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s this figure had risen to sixty percent. It now stands at nearly two-thirds (although this is partly a result of a selection effect, as single males and all-male groups are discouraged). The galvanizing effect of the 1979 debate has been that abolition of the nude law has never since been put on the political agenda as a serious issue.<br><br>Any fears in 2009 that the new female-majority Parliament might dilute the nude law were quickly dispelled. Today, with the Chief Minister, Governor and Chief Justice being women, Palmira is the first independent state anywhere in the world to be controlled by females in all three branches of government. And most citizens attribute this to the influence of the nude law.<br><br>Describing the opening of the 2009 Parliament, one foreign correspondent managed to be both precious and patronizing. "The legislators filed into the chamber, single-breasted suits alongside bare-breasted bodies. Naked bottoms squeaked on leather upholstery and bare bosoms peered across the speaker's table, as the newly appointed Chief Minister rose to address the assembly. Business as usual would be her government's guiding principle." What nonsense! I have not seen a double-breasted jacket in all my time on Palmira.<br><br>Three months later the parliament did enact legislation, not to change the law but to address specific concerns. For instance, penalties and sanctions have been moderated. Special exemptions can be granted and are not as rare as many people believe. The most obvious are for health and safety reasons. For example, the island must weather the occasional hurricane and covering the body is then essential. There are also professional and certain personal circumstances. The government of Palmira adheres to a policy of equal job opportunity, so a woman cannot be denied a job which requires some protective clothing. The Health and Safety Standards Act was passed to address this issue. Otherwise, the authorities are uncompromising. This firm policy is therefore all the more notable given that the government and parliament are dominated by women.<br><br>The men of Palmira have traditionally been self-interested and complacent, but never stupid. They recognize that the continued imposition of the nude law depends on the cooperation and consent of the women subject to it. On the other side, the opposition to its proposed repeal was led by women who understood the roots of their empowerment. For a long time the law served the pleasure of men. It still does, but the women revel in their nudity. It is a form of liberation of the self, and (yes) a source of power over the male which is enhanced, not reduced, by compulsion.<br><br>This island is no utopia. Palmirene society is far from perfect. But whatever problems remain to be solved, the nude law has helped make the little community a model of sexual and social harmony of which they are much and rightly proud.
