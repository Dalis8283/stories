      1: ["Chapter 1", `The cave stank of damp earth and desperation.<br><br>Rain pattered softly outside, barely masking the crackling of distant flames—the last echoes of their village burning. <br><br>Inside, the survivors huddled together, wrapped in whatever cloaks and blankets they’d managed to grab after their frantic escape. Cold crept in through the stone walls, and the air felt heavy with fear.<br><br>Emily sat near the back of the cave, clutching her youngest daughter, Olivia, against her chest. The teenage girl hadn’t said a word since the raid, not even a cry. Just wide, haunted eyes and trembling limbs. <br><br>The doctors said Olivia was slow. Emily thought her daughter was simply a sweet and innocent child in the body of a petite eighteen year old.<br><br>Emily rocked her gently, murmuring a stream of comforting nonsense and her husband’s name—Arthur—like a prayer. He had vanished in the chaos of the attack, and though her heart insisted he was still out there, the growing silence in the woods whispered otherwise.<br><br>Her two older children stayed close. Winifred—Winnie to everyone—stood near the mouth of the cave like a sentry, tall and broad-shouldered, her long braid soaked with rain. She was in her twenties now, and her chin jutted forward with quiet fury. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said, mostly to herself. “The goblins will come back.”<br><br>Emily’s middle child Archibald, or Archie, crouched beside his mother and little sister. He gently rubbed Olivia’s arms, trying to coax warmth—or any reaction—into her limbs. “She’s freezing,” he said quietly to Emily. “She needs a fire.”<br><br>“I know,” Emily replied, her voice thin and exhausted. “But we can’t risk smoke. Not yet.”<br><br>Closer to the wall of the cave, Bertram sat beside his daughter, Jade. <br><br>He had been Emily’s closest friend since they were children, and though they’d taken separate paths in life, she was still the first person he’d looked for when the raid began. His arm rested protectively around Jade’s shoulders.<br><br>Jade, nineteen and small-boned, didn’t speak. She had always been an introvert, even before all this. Her eyes were downcast, fixed on the charcoal sketches filling the pages of her leather-bound notebook. <br><br>She sketched in silence—goblins in battle formation, snarling mouths and cruel saddles strapped to the backs of human captives. She’d been drawing nonstop since they reached the cave.<br><br>“Maybe take a break, love,” Bertram murmured, trying not to let his unease show. “It might upset the others.”<br><br>Jade didn’t answer. Her hand kept moving.<br><br>Emily glanced their way with hollow eyes, then turned back to her children. Archie had taken off his damp cloak and wrapped it around Olivia. He looked up at his mother. “Do you think Dad is still—?”<br><br>“Don’t,” she said, too fast. Then softer, “I don’t know.”<br><br>Near the front of the cave, Cassian tended to his mother, Mirabel. He was twenty-two, lean and handsome in a rugged sort of way, with dark curls matted from the rain. His arm was wrapped around Mirabel’s shoulders, steady and calm despite everything. He whispered something to her, then stood, his sharp eyes scanning the woods.<br><br>“I’ll take first watch,” he offered.<br><br>Winnie stepped forward without hesitation. “I’ll go with you.”<br><br>Cassian arched a brow. “You sure? It’s cold.”<br><br>“I don’t care.”<br><br>Archie watched his older sister with wide eyes. She was always so sure, so brave—but tonight, she looked ready to snap. He pulled Olivia a little closer and tried not to think about the smoke still drifting from where their house had once stood.<br><br>Bertram moved to Emily’s side, handing her a flask of water. “You should drink. For their sake.”<br><br>She accepted it without a word, and for a brief moment, their fingers touched—two people clinging to the familiar in a world that had gone mad.<br><br>A gust of wind howled through the mouth of the cave, making the flames of the small lantern sputter and casting dancing shadows across the walls. In the hush that followed, a soft sound broke the stillness.<br><br>A muffled sob.<br><br>Jade looked up from her sketchbook, her charcoal paused mid-stroke. She turned slightly, eyes flicking toward the source. Olivia, still curled in Emily’s arms, had buried her face in her mother’s chest, shoulders trembling with quiet cries.<br><br>No one else had noticed yet. Emily was gently humming, trying to soothe her. Archie sat beside them, chewing his bottom lip anxiously.<br><br>Jade hesitated—then slowly crawled over, hugging her sketchbook to her chest. She stopped a few feet away, sitting cross-legged on the damp stone. “Um…” she began softly. “Would you… like to see some drawings?”<br><br>Emily looked up sharply. “Jade, I don’t think that’s—”<br><br>But Olivia had already peeked out from the crook of her mother’s arm. Her tear-reddened eyes locked onto the sketchbook. She gave a small sniff and reached a hand out timidly.<br><br>Emily blinked. “Liv?”<br><br>Jade scooted closer and opened the book on her knees, flipping past the darker scenes until she landed on one with less menace: a pretty goblin woman, barely larger than a 10 year old human, looking proud as she rode a saddled human girl like a pony.<br><br>Olivia’s eyes widened. Her gaze darted from the page to her brother, then back. Her voice, hoarse and shaky, broke the silence.<br><br>“That’s… that’s like me and Archie. He’s my pony.”<br><br>A stunned pause.<br><br>Archie’s mouth fell open. Emily gasped—and then covered her mouth with one hand as tears of joy sprang to her eyes.<br><br>“You spoke,” she whispered. “Olivia, sweetheart… you—”<br><br>Olivia smiled. Just a little. Her cheeks still streaked with tears, she leaned sideways to bump her head gently into Archie’s shoulder.<br><br>Archie laughed, his voice cracking. “Well, uh… I guess I did carry you like one, when you lost your shoes…”<br><br>“You are my pony,” Olivia insisted quietly, nestling in closer to him.<br><br>Emily let out a trembling breath, pulling her daughter and son into a tight hug. “Thank the gods…”<br><br>Jade gave a small, shy smile. She looked down, brushing charcoal dust from her fingers.<br><br>Not far off, Winnie had witnessed the whole exchange from her place near the entrance. She rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath, “Great. Goblin fangirl saves the day.”<br><br>Cassian, seated beside her, glanced sideways with a raised brow. “She’s just being kind. Liv hadn’t spoken until now. That’s something.”<br><br>Winnie shrugged, trying to sound indifferent, though her crossed arms tightened. “She's just annoying. Always staring, always sketching those... things.”<br><br>“She’s not hurting anyone,” Cassian said calmly. “And she made Olivia smile. That’s more than any of us managed tonight.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer, but her jaw tightened. Rain dripped steadily at the cave’s mouth, the world beyond still cloaked in danger.<br><br>***<br><br>The cave looked different in the daylight. Pale sunbeams filtered in through the moss-fringed entrance, cutting soft lines through the misty air. Outside, the storm had passed, leaving behind a glistening forest and a silence that felt less ominous and more… expectant.<br><br>“We need to know what’s left,” Winnie said, her voice crisp and awake long before the others. She stood already dressed, her father’s old sword strapped across her back. “Food, water, shelter—if there’s anything to salvage from the village, we should find it now.”<br><br>She didn’t say the other reason. That she still held a flicker of hope that her father, Arthur, might be out there. Or that she wanted to prove she could do more than guard a cave... perhaps capable enough to become the first female soldier in her town...<br><br>Emily looked uneasy, sitting beside Olivia and stroking her tangled hair. “It’s dangerous,” she said.<br><br>“We can’t hide forever. And we are not even sure if it's true that goblins never enter caves.”<br><br>“I’ll go too,” came Bertram’s voice, a bit too quickly. He was buckling his cloak, trying not to meet Emily’s eyes too directly. “You shouldn’t be out there alone, Winnie.”<br><br>Winnie gave a tight nod, her gaze flicking briefly toward Cassian, who was still seated near the fire, quiet, one hand resting gently on Mirabel’s back as she coughed softly into a scrap of linen.<br><br>Winnie hesitated, then said with forced nonchalance, “You coming, Cassian?”<br><br>He looked up, surprise flickering behind his tired eyes. “I’ll stay. My mother’s not strong enough to move yet.”<br><br>“Oh,” Winnie said, trying—and failing—to mask her disappointment. “Of course.”<br><br>Bertram glanced between them, something unreadable in his expression.<br><br>Then, to everyone’s surprise, Olivia piped up in a small but clear voice, “I want to go too.”<br><br>Emily’s head snapped around. “No, sweetie, it’s too dangerous.”<br><br>“But I want to ride my pony again,” Olivia said, tugging on Archie’s sleeve. “Please?”<br><br>Archie chuckled and knelt beside her. “I’ll carry her,” he offered. “Like yesterday. I promise, I’ll keep her safe.”<br><br>“She’s been coughing,” Emily said, torn. “Maybe a bit of sun and dry air would help. But...”<br><br>“She’ll be with me,” Archie said. “And Bertram and Winnie.”<br><br>“And me,” said Jade quietly, standing now, her sketchbook tucked into a satchel. “I want to see… how bad it is.”<br><br>Emily hesitated, her gaze sweeping from her children to the forest just beyond the cave mouth. It was bright out, warm even. The first day of calm since the nightmare began. And she couldn’t deny the relief it would be to stretch her limbs, to move, to feel something other than damp stone and fear.<br><br>“All right,” she said at last. “We all go. But we stay together. No wandering.”<br><br>Cassian rose slowly, brushing off his trousers. “I’ll keep watch here,” he said. “If you’re not back by dusk, we’ll come looking.”<br><br>Emily nodded. “Thank you.”<br><br>Winnie led the way out, eyes scanning the tree line, sword ready. Archie crouched and let Olivia climb on his back, her legs wrapping around his waist with surprising ease. She giggled softly as he stood, adjusting her arms around his shoulders as he gave her a piggyback ride, joining his hands behind his own back to support her butt.<br><br>“You’ve got your pony again,” he said with a wink.<br><br>Olivia leaned in to whisper, “You need a tail.”<br><br>As laughter bubbled from Archie’s lips, Emily watched them all, her heart a knot of fear and pride. Then she stepped out into the light with the others, leaving behind the safety of shadows and stepping back into a world she no longer recognized.<br><br>The village was completely destroyed.<br><br>Charred beams jutted out from piles of ash where homes had once stood. The cobbled path was littered with fragments of everyday life—broken dishes, torn clothing, scorched toys. A wheelbarrow lay on its side, its contents spilled and blackened by fire. And everywhere… the smell. Burnt wood, burnt flesh. The sickly stench of death.<br><br>Olivia’s gasp broke the silence.<br><br>Archie felt her small arms tighten around his neck as she turned her face away, burying it into his shoulder. Her whole body trembled as they passed the first corpse—a neighbor, facedown in the mud, one arm outstretched toward the remains of a smoldering cottage.<br><br>Emily put a hand on Archie’s shoulder, her voice gentle. “Keep moving. Don’t let her look.”<br><br>Jade stepped ahead and pointed toward the short trail that led down to the river. “We should get water. It’s not far. Archie, come with me? It might help… distract her.”<br><br>Emily gave her a grateful nod. “Good idea.”<br><br>Winnie and Bertram split off to check what remained of the granary, boots crunching through shattered pottery and blackened husks.<br><br>Jade led the way down the slope, her satchel bouncing against her hip, while Archie followed slowly with Olivia still clinging to his back. The air grew fresher near the river, and the sound of rushing water soon filled the silence. The trees down here were untouched, their green leaves bright against the desolation behind them.<br><br>As they reached the bank, Jade stopped short.<br><br>There, half-submerged in the mud near the edge, was a saddle—small and lightweight, clearly designed for a human rather than a horse. Its leather was slightly wet and stained, but the chest harness and wrist straps were still intact. The bit and bridle hung partially from one of the saddle bags, glinting dully in the sunlight.<br><br>Jade knelt beside it, brushing away wet leaves. Her fingers hovered over the gear, tracing the marks of use.<br><br>“Someone dropped this,” she murmured, more to herself than anyone. “Or… was freed. Maybe a ponygirl escaped. She might’ve jumped in and swum for it.”<br><br>Archie looked down, uneasy. “Do you think she made it?”<br><br>“I don’t know,” Jade said quietly, looking at the river.<br><br>Behind them, Olivia stared wide-eyed at the gear. Her mouth opened as if to ask something, but she seemed unable to form the words.<br><br>Jade turned to her quickly, recognizing the distress building in her innocent eyes. “Hey, Liv,” she said, voice light. “Do you want to play a game?”<br><br>Olivia looked up, uncertain.<br><br>“How about we make your pony even better?” Jade offered with a little smile. “You already have the best pony in the whole cave—but what if we gave him a real saddle?”<br><br>Archie blinked, catching on immediately. “You hear that, Liv? I could be the fanciest pony.”<br><br>For the first time since leaving the cave, Olivia let out a tiny giggle.<br><br>Archie knelt down so she could slide off. His back cracked slightly as he stood and peeled off his shirt, revealing lean muscle and a back already smudged with dirt.<br><br>“I think you’ll have to figure out how to saddle me, Miss Olivia,” he said, grinning at her. “You and your stable assistant.”<br><br>Jade gave a shy chuckle, then got to work. She inspected the saddle and chest harness, cleaning off the mud and checking the straps. It took a few moments to puzzle out how it all connected—she’d seen goblins strap humans like this before, but never up close. Still, her fingers were nimble and precise, her brows furrowed in focus.<br><br>Archie knelt as Jade positioned the saddle carefully across his back. The leather was cold and still slightly damp, but it fit surprisingly well. She wrapped the chest harness around his torso and clipped it into place, then adjusted the wrist loops attached to the bottom of the saddle, so that Archie’s forearms were kept behind his back to support the saddle.<br><br>Olivia’s eyes were wide with wonder, watching every move.<br><br>When Jade finally buckled the bridle loosely in place—without bit, for now—she stepped back, looking pleased with her work.<br><br>“Well?” she asked.<br><br>Olivia clapped softly. “He’s perfect!”<br><br>Jade smiled, the rare kind that reached her eyes. “Drink some water, pony,” she said while washing the bit in the river.<br><br>And for a moment, in the sun-dappled clearing by the river, they weren’t survivors picking through the ruins of their world. They were children again—pretending, playing, finding solace in a game that masked their grief.<br><br>Olivia's eyes sparkled as she circled slowly around Archie, inspecting him like a serious little rider preparing her steed.<br><br>“I want to ride now,” she said, a firm note of excitement in her voice.<br><br>Archie grinned over his shoulder. “Well, you are the rider.”<br><br>With Jade’s help, Olivia climbed carefully onto her brother’s back, giggling as she settled into the saddle. The fit was surprisingly good, and Olivia looked positively radiant.<br><br>“I want the reins too,” she said.<br><br>Jade raised a brow, hesitating only a moment before reaching into the saddlebag again. “I have the bit ready here,” she said softly. “If you’re okay with it, Archie.”<br><br>Archie gave a theatrical sigh, still kneeling. “If it makes the lady smile…”<br><br>Jade gently fastened the bridle into place and clipped the reins to the bit’s side rings, adjusting the straps to fit snugly but comfortably around Archie’s head. Olivia’s small hands took hold of the reins with visible delight.<br><br>“What about my feet?” she asked suddenly. “There’s nowhere to put them!”<br><br>Jade blinked, then pulled out a pair of simple stirrups from the saddlebag and clipped their leathers to the chest harness.<br><br>With a tap of her bare heels and a gentle tug of the reins, Olivia directed Archie to stand up and then to move forward. He trotted a few steps when she kicked him again, careful not to jostle her too much, then circled back as she squealed in delight.<br><br>“I have the best pony!” she beamed. “Turn! Go faster! Stop!”<br><br>Archie obeyed every command with exaggerated seriousness, sometimes tossing his head in mock resistance to make her laugh harder. <br><br>Olivia’s giggles echoed through the trees like wind chimes, and for a few blessed minutes, the horrors of the village above seemed impossibly far away.<br><br>Jade watched from nearby. A soft smile tugged at her lips—not the polite, hesitant kind she usually wore, but a real one. She didn’t interrupt the game until Olivia had guided Archie through several loops along the river’s edge.<br><br>“Time to head back,” Jade said gently. “We don’t want the others to worry.”<br><br>“Aww,” Olivia pouted, but then tapped Archie’s abdomen proudly with her heels. “Take me up, pony!”<br><br>Archie gave a theatrical snort and nodded, shifting his weight to begin the climb back toward the village ruins, still saddled and bridled, with his rider perched proudly on his back.<br><br>Jade followed alongside, her gaze flicking often between the siblings and the charred horizon above.<br><br>They met at the edge of the ruined village, where the last of the scorched homes gave way to forest paths and tall grass. Bertram and Winnie were already there, their arms burdened with salvaged supplies—blankets, dried goods, a half-broken crate of preserved fruit, and even a bundle of intact kindling.<br><br>Winnie was tying a rope around the stack of goods on her back, putting her own tall and athletic body to work, when she spotted them returning.<br><br>“What in the gods’ names...?” she muttered aloud.<br><br>Archie and Olivia came into view first, the ponygirl saddle cinched tightly across his bare back, reins bobbing in Olivia’s hands as she sat upright with perfect posture and a triumphant grin. Jade walked beside them, smiling faintly as she carried two canteens full of water.<br><br>Bertram chuckled as they approached. “Looks like someone’s found a new calling.”<br><br>Even Emily couldn’t help but laugh, relief softening her tired face. “Oh, Archie…”<br><br>Archie gave a sheepish grin. “She insisted,” he tried to say through the bit in his mouth.<br><br>“She needed it,” Jade added quietly.<br><br>Only Winnie remained stone-faced. She scoffed, rolling her eyes. “Great. Playing pony while goblins torch our homes.”<br><br>The group turned back toward the woods, loaded down with salvaged supplies, and began the slow return to the cave. Olivia remained on Archie’s back, bouncing gently with each step. The sun had risen high, and the trail back wound quietly through mossy underbrush and wet ferns.<br><br>A sudden snap of twigs shattered the calm, and an armed goblin rider appeared in the woods on his mounted ponygirl.<br><br>The group scattered, running toward the cave in a panic.<br><br>Archie froze mid-step, wide-eyed, unsure where to run with his arms tied up behind his back and Olivia still mounted. He looked left, then right—and chose wrong.<br><br>He bolted down a narrow path that veered from the others.<br><br>“Archie!” Emily screamed, too late.<br><br>And then the goblin, armored in rough-scaled leather, burst through the trees and cut them off astride his fully-tacked ponygirl.<br><br>Jade, hidden behind a tree, held her breath as she watched in horror.<br><br>And then, with a sudden, instinctive motion, Olivia pulled the reins.<br><br>The goblin and Olivia came to a halt mere feet away from each other, sitting tall on their respective human mounts. <br><br>The goblin stared at Olivia with narrowed eyes, then tilted his head curiously.<br><br>For a moment, no one moved.<br><br>Then—impossibly—the goblin nodded. Not to Archie, not to the others—but to Olivia.<br><br>He turned his ponygirl around without a word and galloped back into the woods, vanishing between the trees like a shadow in sunlight.<br><br>Archie exhaled sharply through the bit in his mouth. “What… just happened?”<br><br>Jade crawled out from her hiding place, trembling. “He acknowledged her.”<br><br>Emily and the others emerged cautiously from their cover.<br><br>Olivia sat upright in the saddle, blinking as though unsure if it had even happened. She looked down at Archie, then back at the trail where the goblin had disappeared.<br><br>“I made him stop,” she whispered.<br><br>***<br><br>The fire crackled gently at the center of the cave mouth, its orange glow flickering off damp stone. Outside, the sunlight filtered through swaying leaves, but inside, the air remained cool and heavy.<br><br>Everyone was quiet for a long time after returning.<br><br>Olivia sat between Emily and Archie, still bundled in a blanket but looking more alert than she had in days. Her fingers toyed absentmindedly with the reins that Jade had let her keep. <br><br>Archie, newly redressed and a bit sore, sat cross-legged beside her, giving her occasional sideways glances as if still stunned by what had happened.<br><br>Eventually, it was Jade who spoke, voice soft but firm. “I don’t think he was going to attack.”<br><br>Winnie scoffed. “He came galloping in on a ponygirl like a damn warlord. What else would he be doing?”<br><br>“No, listen,” Jade said, drawing her legs up to her chest. “He was going to. But then… he saw Olivia riding Archie. Saddled. Bridled. Reins in her hands.”<br><br>Cassian leaned forward slightly. “And?”<br><br>Jade looked around the circle. “The goblins can be rough on their mounts, but they are not simply slavers. They respect the bond between rider and mount. I think that’s what happened out there…”<br><br>Silence settled over the cave as everyone absorbed the idea.<br><br>“You’re saying…” Emily began slowly, “that seeing Olivia in the saddle… saved them?”<br><br>Jade nodded. “We know that goblins only ride girls. So his normal behavior should have been to kill Archie and kidnap Olivia. But instead, he acknowledged her. He saw a rider in control of her mount. That’s why he left them alone.”<br><br>“Gods,” Bertram muttered. “So what does that mean? We’re supposed to start saddling up like goblins just to survive?”<br><br>“It sounds crazy,” Winnie said flatly, arms crossed. “Should we just start acting like those savages?”<br><br>“They actually have a very advanced civilization, more evolved than ours in many ways…” Jade started, then cut herself off when Winnie visibly rolled their eyes.<br><br>“If it keeps Olivia safe, I don’t care what I have to do,” Archie said, surprisingly calm.<br><br>Emily put her hand gently on his shoulder, pride and worry in equal measure on her face.<br><br>“I think it’s worth testing,” Jade said.<br><br>Cassian glanced down at his mother, who sat wrapped in her cloak near the fire. Mirabel’s cheeks were flushed, and her breathing shallow—she’d begun to cough again. Emily had checked her earlier and said it looked like a simple cold, but the damp cave air was only making it worse.<br><br>“She needs sunlight and fresh air,” Cassian said suddenly. “I’ll take her out.”<br><br>Mirabel looked up at him, her expression weary but loving. “You don’t have to—”<br><br>Cassian crouched beside her. “Let me. You always carried me when I was sick as a child. Time for payback.”<br><br>He knelt, and she chuckled softly as she leaned forward, placing her arms gently around his neck. He lifted her with a grunt, settling her weight across his back in a piggyback hold. She rested her cheek against his shoulder, smiling despite herself.<br><br>“Well then,” she murmured, “my handsome colt.”<br><br>The others watched quietly as he stood and carried her carefully toward the cave entrance. The light from outside caught on the reins still in Olivia’s lap, and Jade’s voice drifted after them like a thought turned into words.<br><br>“Wait. I don’t think this will work,” Jade intervened. “It should look like riding, with authority… not just carrying…”<br><br>“Thank you Jade,” Cassian replied calmly. “We are just going out for a few minutes, staying nearby. I think we will be okay.”<br><br>Outside, the sun hung high in the sky, warm and golden, soaking into skin and stone alike. Cassian moved slowly across a patch of grassy clearing, his steps careful and deliberate. Mirabel clung gently to his back, her head resting against his shoulder, her breath softer now. The sun had begun to ease the damp chill from her lungs, and a smile played faintly at the corners of her lips.<br><br>“You always carried me as a child,” Cassian murmured. “Even when I was too old for it.”<br><br>“You were never too old,” she whispered. “You just got heavy.”<br><br>He chuckled and shifted her slightly to keep her balanced on his back, slightly bent forward. “I thought this might make Jade’s sketchbook.”<br><br>And sure enough, tucked into a hollow just beyond the cave’s mouth, Jade was already scribbling, her eyes flicking between them and the page.<br><br>She crouched low, completely focused, her charcoal stick sweeping across the page—Cassian with his quiet strength, his fragile mother serene on his wide back, surrounded by warm sunlight and gentle shadow. A brief, quiet peace.<br><br>Jade still felt uneasy though.<br><br>Then everything changed in an instant.<br><br>A sharp whip of rope sliced through the air. A lasso snapped tight around Cassian’s body and closed around his legs.<br><br>“What—?!” he shouted as his leg was jerked out from under him.<br><br>He crashed down hard, instinctively twisting to break his fall and shield his mother. Mirabel tumbled from his back with a cry, landing beside him with a muffled thud.<br><br>Two goblins burst from the treeline on the opposite side of the clearing, riding their ponygirls with practiced speed. The first was the same goblin Jade had seen earlier—the one who had spared Olivia and Archie. His expression was unreadable beneath his scarred brow, but his eyes were sharp and alert.<br><br>The second was leaner, meaner, grinning with a lopsided mouth.<br><br>Their ponygirls—two weary-looking human women saddled and bridled in full tack—immediately dropped to their knees at a barked command. The moment they hit the ground, they bent low, pressing their foreheads into the grass like trained beasts. The goblins dismounted in a fluid, practiced motion.<br><br>Before anyone could react, the goblins were already moving.<br><br>Mirabel’s hands were yanked behind her back and bound in seconds. Cassian tried to resist, but his attacker moved quickly, wrenching his arms behind him and knotting his wrists. Hobble straps were fastened around their ankles, making escape impossible. Each goblin then produced a long lead rope, snapping it onto the prisoners’ wrist bindings and tying the other end to the pommels of their saddles.<br><br>It all happened in less than ten seconds.<br><br>Inside the cave, silence turned to chaos.<br><br>“No—!” Emily gasped.<br><br>Winnie was the first to break the spell. She sprinted from the entrance, sword already in hand. “Cassian!”<br><br>The second goblin turned, snarling, and stepped forward with his short, jagged blade. Winnie swung, striking sparks from his parry. She swung again—then again—but the goblin moved with cruel efficiency, deflecting her blows and slashing at her shoulder.<br><br>She yelped and stumbled back, her sword knocked from her hands.<br><br>He raised his blade again—then hesitated. The first goblin barked something in their guttural tongue.<br><br>They already had one prisoner each.<br><br>With a hiss of frustration, the second goblin backed off. Winnie scrambled to her feet, bleeding but upright, and ran back to the cave.<br><br>“Come on! Get back!” Jade screamed.<br><br>Winnie sprinted past her into the cave just as the goblins mounted their kneeling ponygirls. With a jerk of the reins, the women rose awkwardly to their feet, their wrists still tied and the leads tugging the captives forward.<br><br>Cassian looked back one last time, meeting Winnie’s horrified gaze.<br><br>And then they were gone—vanishing into the trees, the goblins tugging their prisoners along behind them.<br><br>The cave was silent again.<br><br>This time, not from peace, but shock.<br><br>Only the sound of Winnie’s ragged breathing filled the space as she stood just inside the entrance, fists clenched, sword arm trembling. Her tunic was torn at the shoulder, a fresh gash glistening with blood. Thankfully it was a superficial cut.<br><br>No one dared speak at first. Jade seemed lost in her thoughts. Olivia clung silently to Emily’s side, eyes wide and tearless.<br><br>Then Winnie snapped.<br><br>“This is your fault!” she shouted, turning toward Jade with fire in her eyes. “You said riding someone would keep us safe! That they respected it! But they took him, they took Cassian!”<br><br>Jade froze where she stood, her back pressed against the cave wall. Her fingers still clutched the corner of her sketchbook, but the rest of her body was stiff, motionless. Her mouth opened slightly, but no words came.<br><br>“You said it was a bond they’d recognize. That they’d leave us alone. And now Cassian and his mother are gone!” Winnie’s voice cracked with the weight of helplessness behind the fury.<br><br>“Winnie—” Emily stepped forward, placing a hand gently on her daughter’s arm.<br><br>But Winnie jerked away. “No! She plays games with reins and saddles like it’s all a story in one of her books—like she understands them—but she doesn’t! She doesn’t!”<br><br>“Stop,” Emily said more firmly this time. “I know you’re scared. We all are. But Jade is not your enemy. She’s trying to help, the same as you.”<br><br>Winnie’s breath hitched, chest rising and falling. Her lip trembled. “I should’ve done something. I—I wasn’t good enough—”<br><br>Emily pulled her close, wrapping her arms around her daughter’s tense frame. “You fought for him. You were brave. But we can’t turn on each other now.”<br><br>Slowly, Winnie sank into the embrace, her shoulders shaking. And she started sobbing.<br><br>A long pause followed. No one dared to move or speak until Jade finally whispered, “I think I know why it didn’t work.”<br><br>All eyes turned to her.<br><br>Jade stood very still, her voice quiet but even. “Cassian was simply carrying Mirabel, whereas Olivia had reins. A saddle. She pulled Archie to a stop with her reins. She appeared in control.”<br><br>Archie frowned, thinking it over. “I mean… yeah. I was trying to run, but she pulled the reins and I instinctively obeyed.”<br><br>“The goblin saw that,” Jade continued. “He saw her as a rider. Someone dominant. That’s what the goblins seem to respect—or at least, what they acknowledge.”<br><br>Bertram sat slowly on a nearby rock, brow furrowed. “So it’s really about who’s in charge.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “That’s what I think. Cassian carried Mirabel out of affection. There was devotion perhaps, but no submission. No claim.”<br><br>Emily rubbed her temple, exhausted but focused. “Then to them, it didn’t look like a worthwhile bond. Just two humans. Unclaimed. Vulnerable.”<br><br>Winnie looked up, wiping a tear from her cheek. “So… if Mirabel had had reins? A saddle? If she’d looked like a rider…”<br><br>“They might have left them alone,” Jade said. “Just like they did with Olivia and Archie.”<br><br>“But why did they take Cassian?” Bertram wondered out loud. “Don’t they only ride girls?”<br><br>“Well…” Jade said, a bit unsure whether to proceed. She paused, took a deep breath, and continued. “I have heard stories about breeding farms, where goblins raise their own human ponygirls. Cassian is a handsome young man. Perhaps he was taken to be turned into... a bull.”<br><br>A silence followed, broken only by the quiet crackling of the fire.<br><br>Finally, Archie shifted uncomfortably. “So… what do we do with that? We can’t all just… pair off and pretend to be ponies and riders, can we?”<br><br>No one had an answer.<br><br>Not yet.<br><br>But the idea had been planted.<br><br>In a world where goblins ruled the land and humans were seen as prey, perhaps it wasn’t as foolish as it sounded.<br><br>Maybe it was survival.<br><br>That night, the fire burned low, its embers pulsing like the last heartbeat of the day. No one spoke much. The silence was fragile, as though one more wrong word might shatter it completely.<br><br>Winnie kept to herself, curled with her back to the others, eyes wide open in the dark. Jade sat a little farther from the circle than usual, sketchbook untouched for the first time in days. Olivia clung to Archie, already asleep, her hands curled into the fabric of his shirt.<br><br>Emily laid with her eyes closed but didn’t sleep. She listened to the soft breathing of her children, the wind outside the cave mouth, and the distant, imagined boots of goblin mounts far away.<br><br>They took Cassian, she thought. They could take any of us.<br><br>***<br><br>Morning came with a pale sun and a breeze that carried the scent of dew and pine. The cave warmed slightly, enough for everyone to shed their blankets and gather in the early light.<br><br>“We need a plan,” Emily said, her voice clear and steady as she stood beside the fire.<br><br>Everyone looked up.<br><br>“I don’t want to believe this is our only option, but… I think Jade might be right. If the goblins see a bond between rider and mount as sacred—or at least off-limits—we need to use that.”<br><br>Bertram stood, adjusting his belt. “Then let’s not waste time. Emily, would you like to ride me?”<br><br>Emily blinked.<br><br>“You are not heavy,” he said quickly, a bit flushed. “And I’m strong. I’ve carried heavier loads in the workshop for hours. If this helps keep you safe, I’ll do it.”<br><br>Emily looked at him for a moment, emotion caught in her throat. “Thank you,” she murmured, feeling a bit insecure and hesitant. She was by no means a large woman, but three consecutive pregnancies had made her a bit softer and heavier than before.<br><br>Jade nodded slightly from the edge of the fire. “Olivia should stay with Archie. That’s already working.”<br><br>Archie gave a little shrug. “She likes riding me. And if it keeps her smiling… sure.”<br><br>That left two.<br><br>Winnie crossed her arms as the group turned their eyes to her. She stiffened.<br><br>“No,” she said flatly.<br><br>Bertram looked at his daughter Jade, then at Winnie. “You are… be the last ones unpaired.”<br><br>“I said no.” Winnie’s voice was sharp. “I’m not turning into a beast of burden for anyone. Least of all Jade.”<br><br>“I wasn’t asking you to,” Jade said softly, not rising to the bite. “But I know I can’t carry you.”<br><br>“Then that’s the end of it.” Winnie turned to Emily. “This is stupid. We’re not animals. I’m not turning into one to play some goblin game.”<br><br>Emily stepped forward slowly. “Winnie… I understand. It’s strange. It’s wrong. But so is watching people get dragged off in ropes like livestock. If this gives us even a chance to avoid that…”<br><br>“We don’t even know if it really works,” Winnie said, voice trembling with frustration. “Cassian—”<br><br>“Cassian wasn’t being ridden,” Jade said quietly, meeting her eyes. “That’s the difference.”<br><br>Winnie looked away, jaw clenched, her breath shallow with rage and shame. “He didn’t deserve to be taken. He was just comforting his mother,” Winnie started sobbing. Then she looked at Jade, “Maybe you should’ve been the one they took.”<br><br>The words hit the cave like a slap.<br><br>Jade flinched. <br><br>Emily gasped. “Winifred!” she snapped.<br><br>But Jade didn’t respond. She just stood there for a few seconds, small and still, eyes on the floor. Then she walked away.<br><br>Jade’s footsteps echoed softly on the stone floor as she walked deeper into the cave, her sketchbook still clutched to her chest like a shield. She didn’t look back.<br><br>Emily turned to her daughter.<br><br>“Winnie, you will carry Jade. And you will obey her, like a goblin’s ponygirl. I am your mother, and you will do as I say.”<br><br>The cave fell silent. Even the birds outside seemed to stop singing.<br><br>Winnie stood slowly, disbelieving. “What?”<br><br>“You heard me,” Emily said. Her voice was calm, steady—but beneath it, there was iron. “You will be Jade’s mount. It’s the safest way for both of you to leave the cave. I can’t risk you being seen as unclaimed and taken by the goblins. Swallow your pride, and do as I say.”<br><br>“You can’t be serious,” Winnie scoffed. “She’s younger than me, and half my size! Why should she be in charge?”<br><br>Emily replied. “Because you are strong enough to carry her. And she deserves to lead. We wouldn’t even have a plan if it wasn’t for her observations about the goblins.”<br><br>Winnie’s mouth opened, closed, then opened again. “Mom. I’m not— I’m not doing this. This is insane.”<br><br>Emily stepped closer. “I wasn’t asking. I am commanding you, Winifred.”<br><br>Winnie’s face flushed, her fists trembling. “You want me to walk through the woods with her on my back like I’m some animal?”<br><br>“I want you to keep your people safe,” Emily said, voice low now, but unyielding. “Cassian and Mirabel are gone. I won’t lose anyone else—especially not you, and especially not because of pride. We need to give this a try.”<br><br>For a long moment, Winnie just stared at her.<br><br>Then slowly, she turned around and walked toward the deeper section of the cave, looking for Jade.<br><br>She found her, and their eyes met. They were alone.<br><br>Winnie’s voice was bitter as she knelt onto one knee. “Well? Let’s get this over with.”<br><br>Jade looked at her hesitantly. “You don’t have to if it’s—”<br><br>“Don’t,” Winnie cut in. “Just climb on.”<br><br>Carefully, Jade stepped on Winnie’s thigh and slipped her arms over Winnie’s shoulders, mounting her piggyback, her thighs wrapping lightly around Winnie’s rib cage. She was light, but the weight wasn’t what made Winnie’s skin prickle.<br><br>It was the submission. The humiliation. The undeniable feeling of being claimed.<br><br>Winnie stood up under her weight, but Jade was not satisfied. “Get down.”<br><br>Winnie hesitated.<br><br>“On your knees, ponygirl,” Jade said firmly, and Winnie let her down with a snort.<br><br>“What did I do wrong?” Winnie asked, rolling her eyes.<br><br>“If this is going to work, you need to see me as your rider. Not just for show—but in here.” Jade touched Winnie’s upper chest lightly.<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer, feeling frustrated.<br><br>Jade sat down on her blanket, and tilted her head. “Let’s start with something simple. Tell me what you admire about me.”<br><br>Winnie shot her a glare. “You’re serious?”<br><br>“Completely.”<br><br>Winnie’s fists clenched on her thighs as she sat down on her own heels. “This is ridiculous.”<br><br>“It’s survival,” Jade said softly. “Look at me. Really look. And speak.”<br><br>A long silence.<br><br>Then, haltingly, “You… draw well. Better than anyone I’ve seen.”<br><br>Jade didn’t respond, just nodded slightly, encouraging her to continue.<br><br>“I guess... You observe things other people miss,” Winnie added. “You see detail. You remember. You… notice what people feel, even when they’re not saying it.”<br><br>Jade’s expression remained still, expectant.<br><br>“You’re… calm,” Winnie went on, her voice low. “Even when things are bad. You don’t panic. You always look like you’re thinking your way through it.”<br><br>Another pause. Then, “And I guess you’re brave. Not in a loud way. But when you believe in something, you step forward even though you look like you’d rather disappear.”<br><br>Jade waited, letting the words settle.<br><br>“Now,” she said softly, “tell me what I do better than you.”<br><br>Winnie tensed. “Why does that matter?”<br><br>“Because submission is not weakness. It’s recognizing when someone else is meant to lead. So, say it.”<br><br>Winnie looked away, biting the inside of her cheek.<br><br>“You… you don’t need to be liked. You just do what you think is right. I act strong, but I care too much about what people think.”<br><br>Jade’s gaze never wavered.<br><br>“You’re patient,” Winnie said more quietly now. “I get angry fast. I hate being wrong. You just… wait until people come to their senses.”<br><br>The admission hurt more than she thought it would.<br><br>“And?”<br><br>“You understand people better,” Winnie finished. “I don’t know how you do it. But you do.”<br><br>Jade’s voice was calm and even: “Good. Now tell me what you see when you look at me.”<br><br>Winnie blinked. “You mean, physically?”<br><br>Jade gave a small nod. “Yes. Look at me, and describe what you see. Your honest thoughts.”<br><br>Winnie swallowed. This part was somehow harder than all the rest.<br><br>“You’re… pretty, I guess,” she said, begrudgingly.<br><br>Jade’s lips curved just slightly. “Go on.”<br><br>“Your skin is pale and smooth. You have that sort of delicate face people always sketch in old books. High cheekbones. Long lashes. Small nose.” She glanced down. “Slender hands.”<br><br>Jade stretched one foot out slightly, bare against her blanket, toes relaxed. She had slipped out of her boots and socks to let them take some air.<br><br>Winnie’s gaze flicked downward and paused.<br><br>“You have… pretty feet,” she said, as if the words burned her throat. “They’re small. Delicate. Clean.”<br><br>“You are doing well,” Jade said softly. “You are not less for saying these things. You are braver now than you have ever been.”<br><br>Winnie let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.<br><br>The lamp between them dimmed to a soft glow.<br><br>The silence between them was less awkward now—not tense, not resentful. Just still.<br><br>Winnie remained kneeling, her hands resting lightly on her thighs.<br><br>Jade tilted her head, her voice as soft as before. “Would you like to kiss them?”<br><br>Winnie’s eyes flicked up, startled—but not angry. Not anymore. “That’s not funny.”<br><br>“I am not joking. You said they are pretty. Would it really be so terrible to kiss them?”<br><br>Winnie looked down at the small pale feet before her, clean and well-kept. A part of her bristled on instinct—Winnie, the fighter, the hunter, the proud and athletic one, always standing tall. <br><br>But another part, deeper and quieter, was… curious perhaps?<br><br>She swallowed. “I wouldn’t hate it, I guess”<br><br>Jade didn’t smirk, didn’t gloat. She just nodded once, serene. “Then do it.”<br><br>Winnie hesitated a moment longer—then leaned forward.<br><br>She placed a kiss, feather-light, on the top of Jade’s left foot. Then, gently, one on the right. Her lips brushed the smooth skin, warm from the firelight.<br><br>When she pulled back and looked up, her breath caught.<br><br>Jade gazed down at her, calm and composed—so still, so in control. <br><br>And Winnie, on her knees, head tilted back to meet her eyes, felt something she couldn’t quite name. She had expected humiliation, reluctancy. What she found instead was a strange rush of intensity, of surrender, of… something she had never felt before.<br><br>A slow flush spread across her neck. She lowered her gaze again, confused by her own reaction.<br><br>Jade didn’t move. She didn’t push.<br><br>She just let Winnie feel it.<br><br>And in that silence, something between them deepened. <br><br>A shift, powerful and unspoken.<br><br>Jade and Winnie remained close—Winnie still kneeling, now silent and thoughtful, while Jade sat calmly, composed, her posture straight but unthreatening.<br><br>Neither had spoken since the foot kisses.<br><br>But the quiet no longer crackled with tension. It had shifted into something else. Something weightier.<br><br>Jade finally broke the silence, her voice gentle but unwavering.<br><br>“Winnie.”<br><br>The kneeling girl looked up, her expression no longer defiant, but… waiting.<br><br>Jade met her eyes. “From now on, I won’t ask.”<br><br>Winnie blinked. “What?”<br><br>“I won’t ask for your obedience,” Jade said. “I’ll command it. That’s what this has to be.”<br><br>Winnie opened her mouth slightly, as if to protest—but stopped herself. She was listening now. Truly listening.<br><br>“If I tell you to kneel,” Jade continued, “you do it. If I tell you to kiss my feet, you do it. Without hesitation. Without asking why.”<br><br>Her tone never rose. She didn’t threaten. She didn’t dominate with volume or force.<br><br>She simply spoke the truth of the bond she was forging.<br><br>“I need your obedience,” Jade said. “Not as a suggestion. As a certainty. It will keep us safe. The goblins don’t hesitate. They don’t doubt. They see control. Clarity. If you waver—if you hesitate—they’ll sense it. And they’ll take us both.”<br><br>Winnie stared at her, cheeks still faintly flushed. “So… I’m just supposed to obey? No matter what you say?”<br><br>“Yes,” Jade said. “I will not abuse it. But obedience means nothing if it’s filtered through your judgment, if you only listen when you agree.”<br><br>Jade leaned in slightly, her eyes soft but steady. “I need your trust. The kind that doesn’t wait to think.”<br><br>Winnie’s jaw tightened… then loosened. She lowered her eyes again.<br><br>“I… I don’t know if I can do that,” she admitted, her voice small.<br><br>“You already started,” Jade said. “Just now. You kissed my feet. You looked up at me and didn’t fight it.”<br><br>Winnie looked up again, meeting Jade’s gaze.<br><br>“That was not too hard. As I said, they are pretty…” she whispered.<br><br>“I know,” Jade replied. “But this isn’t about liking it. This is about surrender. Completely. When I command, you obey. No matter the order. No matter your pride.”<br><br>The words hung in the air.<br><br>And then, Jade gave her the simplest of tests.<br><br>“Kiss them again.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t move for half a second.<br><br>But then—without a word, without argument—she bent forward and kissed the top of each of Jade’s feet once more. Slower this time. Purposeful.<br><br>When she looked up, her breath was steady. Her cheeks flushed. Her pride, still burning—but no longer leading her.<br><br>Jade reached out and touched the top of Winnie’s head, briefly.<br><br>“Good girl.”<br><br>And the strange thing was… Those two words didn’t sting. They didn’t sound condescending. In fact, they thrilled Winnie.<br><br>Jade studied her for a moment longer, then spoke, her tone calm and quiet.<br><br>“Get on all fours.”<br><br>There was no challenge in the words, no sharpness—only the expectation of obedience.<br><br>Winnie’s lips parted slightly, but she didn’t question it.<br><br>She moved slowly, deliberately, shifting onto her hands and knees. Her palms pressed to the cold stone, her back forming a clean, level line beneath her tunic. She exhaled through her nose, steady and quiet.<br><br>Jade waited a moment.<br><br>“Now turn to your right,” she said.<br><br>Winnie crawled in a semicircle, moving smoothly, until she was facing the far wall of the cave.<br><br>“To your left.”<br><br>Winnie turned again without hesitation, returning to face Jade.<br><br>Jade’s voice was just a whisper now. “Lay down. On your back.”<br><br>Winnie hesitated—not out of rebellion, but because this was new. Vulnerable. Unarmed. And Jade had given her no context.<br><br>But then, without a word, she lowered herself, her body stretched out completely, awaiting orders.<br><br>Jade watched her closely. She could see the fight happening inside Winnie. But on the outside, she found no resistance. No prideful glance. No words.<br><br>Just stillness.<br><br>Jade rose quietly, stepping forward. Her bare feet padded softly across the blanket until she stood beside Winnie’s prone body. For a long moment, she simply looked down at her.<br><br>Then she lifted one foot—and placed it gently on Winnie’s abdomen.<br><br>Winnie tensed, but didn’t move.<br><br>Jade shifted her weight slightly, pushing slightly into Winnie’s body. Not cruelly. Not to cause pain. Just enough to assert: You are beneath me.<br><br>Winnie’s breath caught—but she held still.<br><br>The two girls kept eye contact for a few seconds, as if acknowledging their positions. Then Jade stepped up and placed her second foot on Winnie’s chest, between her breasts. She now stood fully, evenly, balanced atop her.<br><br>Still, Winnie did not move.<br><br>She laid there, flushed with heat, her heart pounding in her ears, her breath shallow, but calm in her submission. Not broken—but yielding.<br><br>And somewhere within the overwhelming quiet of the cave, a realization bloomed between them both.<br><br>Jade was not humiliating her.<br><br>She was claiming her.<br><br>And Winnie… was letting her.<br><br>Because, at last, she understood the stakes. She could feel the need for a bond. And she had chosen her rider.<br><br>Jade stood still for several moments, feet pressed against Winnie’s body as she gauged her breathing, her tension, her stillness beneath her.<br><br>Then, with measured grace, she stepped down onto the blanket.<br><br>“Back on all fours,” she said immediately.<br><br>The command was quiet—neither sharp nor coaxing. Just firm, expected.<br><br>With less hesitation than ever before, Winnie obeyed.<br><br>She pushed herself up, hands and knees pressed squarely against the stone, her back straight and steady. Her breath had steadied, her cheeks still warm, but her eyes were focused now, determined.<br><br>Jade watched her for only a second. Then she sat.<br><br>With the ease of someone using a familiar bench, she lowered herself gracefully onto Winnie’s shoulder blades, straddling her and then crossing her legs at the ankles. She let her full weight settle gently downward, her hips shifting slightly to find a comfortable perch.<br><br>Winnie stiffened at first, instinctively bracing herself for the weight. Jade was light—petite, poised—and carried herself with balance and grace.<br><br>Still, Winnie felt pressure. Presence. Control.<br><br>Jade didn’t move. She simply let herself relax, allowing her body to settle naturally onto her new seat. Her weight sagged just slightly into Winnie’s back, making her feel unmistakably owned.<br><br>And Winnie… endured.<br><br>More than that—she adjusted.<br><br>She shifted her hands a little wider for support. She drew her knees in for balance. And she breathed deeply, choosing strength over pride, endurance over resentment.<br><br>This is what it needs to be like, she thought. I’m hers to mount.<br><br>And somewhere beneath the strange blend of submission and resolve… was pride.<br><br>Pride in her strength.<br><br>Pride that she could hold the girl who now sat so casually on her spine, as if the position were perfectly natural. Pride that she could make Jade feel secure, supported, comfortable—even while kneeling like furniture.<br><br>She was uncomfortable, of course. But for some reason she didn’t hate this.<br><br>Then Jade spoke, her voice calm but clear.<br><br>“How do you feel right now?”<br><br>Winnie didn’t lift her head. She answered from her place beneath her rider.<br><br>“Strong,” she said softly.<br><br>Jade’s weight shifted slightly as she uncrossed her legs and let them dangle along either side of Winnie’s head, sharply enough that her heels grazed lightly against Winnie’s breasts.<br><br>“Good,” she replied. “You should.”<br><br>Several minutes passed in silence.<br><br>Jade remained seated comfortably on Winnie’s back, her posture relaxed but her tone calm and clear as she gave her next command.<br><br>“Look at my feet.”<br><br>Winnie tilted her head slightly, her gaze sliding downward. Jade’s feet were lifted from the ground, skin smooth and pale in the warm light of the lantern.<br><br>“Now,” Jade continued, “tell me again why you think they’re pretty.”<br><br>Winnie’s mouth was dry, but she spoke without delay this time.<br><br>“They’re small,” she said slowly. “Delicate. Clean. Every toe is in proportion. Your nails are neat. Your skin looks… soft. And when you move them, it’s graceful. Like everything you do.”<br><br>Jade listened quietly, her fingers brushing idly over her own knee.<br><br>“Good,” she said softly. “Remember all of that.”<br><br>Winnie furrowed her brow. “Why?”<br><br>Jade shifted her weight slightly on her back—not enough to strain, just enough to remind her she was there, comfortable, commanding from above.<br><br>“Because when we’re out there,” Jade said, “and I’m riding you in the open—through mud, through heat, through hills and rough terrain—there will be moments when you will be exhausted. When your knees will ache. When your back will burn under my weight, and your muscles will beg for a break. And when I tell you to go faster, or turn, or kneel, every part of you will want to ignore me.”<br><br>Winnie said nothing, but her silence was one of focus now, not resistance.<br><br>“In those moments,” Jade continued, her voice lower, more intimate, “I want you to picture these feet. These small, delicate feet… not having to touch the ground. Not walking. Not bleeding. Because you are carrying them. You are keeping them comfortable and clean. Protected.”<br><br>Jade placed a hand on Winnie’s head, as if holding her in place. Then she let one foot swing backward, nudging Winnie’s breast with her heel—testing, hinting.<br><br>“These feet will guide you,” she said. “They will kick you when I need more effort. And you will obey without question. When I wear spurs—and I will—these feet will press painfully into your sides. Not to punish. But to command. To direct.”<br><br>Winnie’s breathing deepened.<br><br>“Because that’s how it works,” Jade said simply. “That’s how goblins thrive. They ride their humans—own them—and their ponygirls don’t hesitate. That’s how they move through this world with power.”<br><br>She leaned forward slightly, letting Winnie feel more of her weight on her arms, keeping her sitting position in quiet authority.<br><br>“We become like them,” she finished. “We adapt. We survive. And that means I ride… and you obey.”<br><br>Winnie remained still beneath her, the flickering light warming her cheeks, her back, the hollow of her pride.<br><br>Thoughts of rebellion, of independence, of any other solution to their predicament…<br><br>Then she took a deep breath and she thought of Jade’s feet—small, lovely, vulnerable. And how they’d never touch the dirt so long as she remained strong and obeyed their kicks.<br><br>She looked at them, lifted from the ground thanks to her. And in that image… she found purpose.<br><br>She bowed her head, her voice a whisper. “Yes, Jade.”<br><br>Both girls maintained their positions, breathing deeply, absorbing the unequivocal shift in power.<br><br>Then… “Good girl,” Jade said quietly.<br><br>This time, those two words landed with a warmth that Winnie hadn’t expected—soft praise, yet undeniably commanding.<br><br>“But there is more to learn,” Jade continued. “You’ll need to get used to non-verbal commands. If we’re spotted, I won’t always have the chance to speak. If we want to convince them that I’m your rider, I need to control you with a touch, a nudge, a signal. Like they do.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer. Her arms tensed just slightly beneath her.<br><br>Jade reached down, fingers weaving gently into Winnie’s hair.<br><br>“Let’s begin.”<br><br>She gave a small tug—not painful, but firm—pulling gently to the right.<br><br>Winnie turned her head, confused.<br><br>“No,” Jade said softly. “Your whole body. Turn right, on the spot.”<br><br>Another tug, firmer.<br><br>Winnie huffed through her nose, but adjusted her hands and knees, shuffling to the right until she faced a different direction. When she felt no more pulling, she stopped.<br><br>Jade nodded, even though she knew Winnie couldn’t see it.<br><br>The pull came again—this time on the opposite side of her head. Winnie obeyed more quickly this time, shifting back around to her left.<br><br>Then came the nudge.<br><br>A soft tap from Jade’s bare heels against Winnie's breasts. Then another, firmer.<br><br>Winnie glanced back slightly, brow furrowed.<br><br>“Crawl,” Jade said simply.<br><br>Winnie began to move, her hands and knees brushing across the cool cave floor. Jade’s weight shifted with her motion, staying balanced, poised.<br><br>Then came another kick—this one quicker, more decisive.<br><br>“Faster,” Jade said.<br><br>Winnie growled under her breath but quickened her pace, crawling in tight loops as directed by Jade’s hands and feet, the faint sound of her breathing joined by the dull thump of palms on stone.<br><br>This is stupid, Winnie thought when she started struggling. Why waste strength now? For what?<br><br>Each kick of Jade’s heels felt more frustrating. Each tug at her hair more humiliating. They weren’t going anywhere. This wasn’t survival—it was performance for the sake of it.<br><br>Winnie’s frustration rose until she felt a tear travel down her own cheek. This is going too far. Who does she think she is?<br><br>Then—somewhere between a sharp left tug and a double tap of Jade’s heels—Winnie understood.<br><br>This was training.<br><br>The tug of the hair was the reins. The heels were a much more gentle version of the spurs she would soon feel. <br><br>This wasn’t to degrade her—it was to prepare her. When the moment came—when goblins appeared from the trees and Jade had to steer her without a word—this had to be second nature.<br><br>If she hesitated then, they’d both be taken.<br><br>She slowed a little, feeling tired and distracted by the inner storm of her contrasting thoughts. Jade immediately kicked her again.<br><br>“Faster.”<br><br>And this time, Winnie obeyed without resentment.<br><br>Her breath grew heavier, her muscles burned and her knees hurt—but her focus sharpened. Her movements grew smoother. More precise. And Jade, quiet above her, offered no praise yet—only steady cues, a quiet rhythm of direction and expectation.<br><br>Winnie realized that she was beginning to let go of her resistance. This was what it meant to become a mount.<br><br>Winnie decided that she would learn.<br><br>Because next time, the ride might not be inside a cave.<br><br>Next time, it might mean life or death.<br><br>Jade kept commanding, and Winnie kept crawling.<br><br>Her breath came in heavy pulls, her muscles sore, her back damp with sweat where Jade had been seated for what was starting to feel like a long time. <br><br>Jade’s heels had kicked her breasts more times than she could count, but now, at last, came a gentle tug at her hair—this time not to steer, but to halt.<br><br>“Stop,” Jade said quietly.<br><br>Winnie obeyed.<br><br>She let her back sink a little further under Jade, her head bowed instinctively beneath her rider, strands of hair falling over her flushed face. Her chest rose and fell with effort—but not defiance. <br><br>Jade remained seated for a moment longer, letting the silence settle over them.<br><br>Then, she leaned forward slightly, her voice calm but edged with a rare softness.<br><br>“Do you feel ready to be my ponygirl now?”<br><br>Winnie didn’t lift her head right away. She took a breath, then another. And when she did speak, her voice surprised them both.<br><br>“Yes,” she said simply. “I do.”<br><br>Jade blinked. She had expected another quiet nod. A reluctant answer, maybe. But not this… calm conviction.<br><br>“You asked me before to say what makes you better than me,” Winnie said, her voice steady now despite her fatigue. “And I did. I am not sure if I fully believed it then. But I do now.”<br><br>Jade said nothing—only watched her, eyes deep and focused.<br><br>“You are a better leader,” Winnie continued. “You don’t act on impulse. You think first. You’re patient. Quiet. You see more than the rest of us, and you understand what we need before we do.”<br><br>She paused, then added with a tired, rueful smile, “And I’m strong. I can carry you. I want to carry you.”<br><br>Her voice grew softer now, the final words barely above a whisper.<br><br>“So yes, I will be your ponygirl. Because someone has to lead… and someone has to obey. And I trust you enough to obey you.”<br><br>Jade stared at her for a long moment—eyes wide, lips parted just slightly in something like awe.<br><br>Then she placed one hand gently atop Winnie’s bowed head. Not in condescension. Not in triumph.<br><br>But in acknowledgment.<br><br>“You will make a good pony,” she said.<br><br>And for the first time, Winnie smiled beneath her.<br><br>***<br><br>The fire had dulled to a soft glow, casting long shadows as most of the group sat gathered near the mouth of the cave, speaking in low tones.<br><br>Away from them, further into the cave, Jade remained seated atop Winnie’s back. The silence between them was no longer tense, no longer strained. It was charged with something deeper—understanding, trust, purpose.<br><br>Jade leaned down, her voice soft but clear.<br><br>“Are you ready to be completely submissive to me… in front of the others?”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer right away.<br><br>She shifted slightly beneath her rider, lifting her head up to meet Jade’s gaze. There was no resentment in them now. Only thoughtfulness. Vulnerability. And resolve.<br><br>“This is the final test,” Jade continued. “When we’re out there—exposed, surrounded, watched—I need to know you won’t falter. I need to know you’ll obey… even when others are watching.”<br><br>Winnie took a breath. Her pride was still there—but no longer in conflict with her role. It had reshaped itself into something new.<br><br>Into dignity in obedience.<br><br>“Yes,” she said. “I’m ready.”<br><br>Jade nodded once, then gave her quiet, unspoken command. She kicked Winnie’s breasts with her heels, more firmly than ever before.<br><br>Winnie began to crawl.<br><br>She placed her palms to the ground, then her knees, her back straightening into a solid platform. <br><br>Jade adjusted her seat without fuss, straddling her with what already felt like practiced ease. Her hands rested lightly on Winnie’s hair, her legs dangling in comfort next to Winnie’s struggling arms.<br><br>No words.<br><br>The pressure of Jade’s body weight kept Winnie grounded, guided. No commands were spoken. Only the language of contact.<br><br>As they drew near the fire, the hum of conversation began to fade.<br><br>Archie was the first to notice them, turning mid-sentence as his eyes widened.<br><br>Emily set down the food she had been stirring.<br><br>Bertram stood still, uncertain.<br><br>And Olivia’s mouth opened in a little round O of awe.<br><br>Then all of them watched in stunned silence as Winnie, proud and calm and utterly obedient, crawled forward with Jade seated high on her back, carrying her humbly like it was the most natural thing in the world.<br><br>When they reached the heart of the cave, Jade gave a gentle but firm pull on Winnie’s hair.<br><br>She stopped instantly, her posture perfect, her breathing steady.<br><br>Jade sat still, poised and balanced on her mount, looking over the group like she had always belonged above them—quiet, small, and utterly in control.<br><br>No words passed between rider and ponygirl.<br><br>But the message was clear.<br><br>Obedience.<br><br>Control.<br><br>Unity.<br><br>And the rest of the cave—mouths open, eyes wide—could only watch in silence as the new order revealed itself.`],
      2: ["Chapter 2", `Jade didn’t speak immediately. She let the silence stretch, letting the weight of the moment settle over everyone like dust in a forgotten chapel.<br><br>Then, with quiet precision, she shifted slightly and swung one leg over the side. Her movements were calm, deliberate, and unhurried. She now sat sideways on Winnie’s back, both legs resting along one side of her mount’s body, her legs crossed as if trusting her mount’s steadiness.<br><br>From this new position, facing the others directly, she adjusted her posture to perfect ease—back straight, hands resting on her lap, looking every bit the picture of quiet command.<br><br>Winnie didn’t move beneath her. She remained on all fours, perfectly balanced, her head lowered slightly in a posture of composed submission.<br><br>Jade looked out across the stunned expressions in the firelight.<br><br>“I assume,” she said coolly, “that some of you will have questions.”<br><br>They did.<br><br>“Is this a joke?” Bertram asked, stepping forward. “You’re really going to… ride her around now?”<br><br>“No,” Jade replied. “This isn’t about dominance for its own sake. This is about survival. This”—she gestured downward with a calm hand resting on Winnie’s shoulder—“is our answer to the goblins.”<br><br>Emily leaned forward. “I thought you were just going to talk to her… but this… this is different.”<br><br>“Yes,” Jade said simply. “Because we had to go beyond theory. I had to know that she would obey me fully, even in front of others. That she wouldn’t hesitate. That I could command her by touch, by movement, without a word.”<br><br>Archie looked between the two girls, amazed. “But… how? She used to hate you.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t speak. She remained still beneath Jade, her silence no longer defiant—but devoted.<br><br>Jade gave a small nod, her voice calm. “She didn’t hate me. She just had some resentment. But we talked. A lot. I made her confront things. And she chose this. Not out of shame—but out of clarity.”<br><br>She let the words breathe before continuing.<br><br>“She saw that I’m better suited to lead—and she’s strong enough to carry. She wants to carry me now. Because it means protecting me, her leader. Because it means protecting all of us when the goblins come.”<br><br>There was another pause.<br><br>Then Olivia’s small voice broke the silence: “She looks like a real ponygirl now.”<br><br>Jade smiled faintly. “That’s the point.”<br><br>Emily nodded slowly, visibly processing. Bertram looked uncomfortable but thoughtful. Archie blinked, mouth still slightly ajar.<br><br>Then Jade added, “This is how we are going to live, all of us. Clear bonds. Absolute trust. And roles we don’t question. It’s the only way we survive in their world.”<br><br>She gave Winnie’s shoulder a small, appreciative pat.<br><br>“Winnie has already accepted it. Now the rest of you need to decide what you’re willing to become.”<br><br>Long moments of silence followed.<br><br>Winnie remained on all fours, her arms trembling just slightly now, her breath growing shallower.<br><br>Jade sat composed on her back, legs still draped neatly along one side, hands folded on her lap, answering questions with calm efficiency. The firelight danced against her face, her posture perfect. <br><br>Relaxed. In control.<br><br>And seemingly in no hurry to stand.<br><br>Winnie gritted her teeth.<br><br>At first, it felt like a moment of triumph. A quiet, public declaration of trust and loyalty. But minutes had stretched into more, and now the reality of what she had accepted was pressing down on her—literally.<br><br>Her back ached. Her wrists were sore. Her knees throbbed where bone met stone.<br><br>This is totally unnecessary, she thought, her jaw tightening.<br><br>Jade wasn’t directing her. She wasn’t practicing commands. She was simply… sitting. Like she’d found herself a convenient human bench. Like Winnie’s body was now her rightful place of rest.<br><br>She’s testing me, Winnie thought. Pushing it. Seeing how far I’ll go. Am I just a stool now? Is this what I signed up for?<br><br>Frustration began to rise in her chest, hot and pulsing. Her fingers twitched against the ground. Her pride, carefully laid down earlier that night, stirred again—restless.<br><br>And then Bertram spoke.<br><br>He didn’t raise his voice, but there was something sharp beneath the surface.<br><br>“Jade… why are you still sitting on her like that?” he asked. “It seems unnecessary. And—honestly—it looks humiliating.”<br><br>Winnie held her breath.<br><br>Jade didn’t flinch. She didn’t look down at Winnie. She simply turned her head slightly toward Bertram and answered, calm as ever.<br><br>“There are two reasons, father,” she said.<br><br>“The first,” she continued, “is that Winnie is in training. Strength matters. But a good ponygirl also needs endurance, both physically and mentally. I’m not very heavy, but over time, weight adds up. She has to build stamina to carry me longer, further. If she weakens here, in safety, what happens when I need her in danger?”<br><br>Bertram hesitated, unsure how to respond.<br><br>Jade’s voice remained steady.<br><br>“The second reason,” she said, “is even more important.”<br><br>She placed one hand gently between Winnie’s shoulder blades, not pushing—just grounding.<br><br>“There will be times when I give commands she won’t agree with. Times she’ll think I’m being unreasonable, or selfish, or wrong. In those moments, she’ll feel the temptation to resist. Right now is one of those moments.”<br><br>Winnie blinked, stunned.<br><br>Jade knew.<br><br>“She’s tired,” Jade went on. “She’s questioning this. Wondering why I’m still seated, why I’m making her suffer even though we are not in immediate danger from the goblins.”<br><br>She let that silence linger for just a breath.<br><br>“However,” Jade said, “submission only means something when it’s tested. Otherwise, it’s just agreement.”<br><br>The cave was silent.<br><br>Bertram looked thoughtful now. Emily’s expression had shifted from doubt to something closer to understanding.<br><br>Winnie, still hurting, felt the heat rise to her eyes—not from anger now, but from something rawer.<br><br>Jade was pushing her. But she had also seen her. Understood her. Predicted the rebellion before it even surfaced.<br><br>And she had still trusted her not to break.<br><br>Her breath steadied.<br><br>Her arms trembled, but she held firm.<br><br>Because Jade had just reminded her why she had submitted in the first place. And why she still wanted to.<br><br>Emily had been the one pushing Winnie to give Jade a chance, but now she looked uneasy as she witnessed her daughter suffering beneath Jade’s weight.  She cleared her throat quietly. “If we accept this—this way of doing things—how far do we take it?”<br><br>She wasn’t addressing anyone in particular, but Bertram answered.<br><br>“Far enough to keep us from getting killed or dragged away in chains.”<br><br>There were nods. Slow. Uncertain.<br><br>Archie looked at his older sister serving as Jade’s chair, then at his younger sister Olivia. “I have already been carrying Liv… I don’t mind…”<br><br>“But ponygirls don’t just carry their goblin riders,” Jade said from her place atop Winnie, her voice level. “The goblins ride them. With discipline. With structure. That’s what we need to imitate. The rider must be trusted and obeyed. The mount must be completely subservient. Without it, it’s just pretending and it won't work.”<br><br>Emily looked over at Archie and Olivia. “Archie… do you think you could keep carrying her like you’ve been doing, just… in a more structured way?”<br><br>Archie nodded slowly. “If it keeps her safe? Yeah. I mean… she likes it. She trusts me. And I want to keep her safe. I think we could make it work.”<br><br>Olivia gave a tiny, satisfied smile and nestled her head into her brother’s chest.<br><br>Then all eyes slowly turned to Emily and Bertram.<br><br>He gave a hesitant shrug. “I already offered to carry you, Emily. I’m just not sure I can… submit like Winnie did.”<br><br>“We’ll give you some time to think,” Jade said. “But if you want to keep her safe, she’ll need full authority over your movement. You can’t argue while you’re ridden. You will be her mount.”<br><br>No one objected.<br><br>Because there was nothing left to say.<br><br>The roles had begun to take shape.<br><br>The old world had burned. And in its ashes, something new was rising: a world where submission might mean survival. Where pride might get you killed. And where carrying someone might just be the only way to carry on.<br><br>The fire cracked again, a single pop echoing through the cave like punctuation.<br><br>Jade remained seated, legs draped along one side of Winnie’s back, spine straight, gaze calm, still poised on her living bench of muscle and resolve. Her hand rested lightly on Winnie’s shoulder, not to hold her down—but as a reminder that she belonged there now.<br><br>And then Jade turned to Emily.<br><br>“You should take your seat,” she said, her tone quiet but firm.<br><br>Emily blinked. “My… seat?”<br><br>Jade gave a single nod. “My father is your mount. Start using him—now. Sit on him. Like I’m sitting on Winnie. You need to show him… and yourself… who is in command.”<br><br>Bertram’s brows lifted, but he nodded. “If that’s what you want...”<br><br>Emily hesitated—just a moment. But then she stepped forward. “Bertram,” she said softly, “get down on your hands and knees.”<br><br>He obeyed without question. Then, with quiet ease, he lowered himself onto all fours.<br><br>Emily looked at him—her oldest friend—and then sat carefully on his back, settling into a relaxed seat. Her hands rested lightly in her lap, her breathing slow but steady.<br><br>Jade nodded with approval. “Now shift a little backwards, until your feet are lifted from the ground. Make him feel your full weight.”<br><br>As Emily complied, driving the air out of Bertram’s lungs as she shifted on his back, Jade turned her gaze to Olivia.<br><br>Jade smiled, just faintly. “Liv. It’s your turn.”<br><br>Olivia stood with a timid smile. “On all fours, pony,” she said in her sweet voice, trying to sound commanding.<br><br>Archie chuckled softly, but obeyed. “Yes, ma’am.”<br><br>The girl climbed onto his back, shifting her weight until she sat comfortably, both legs hanging along one side. She straightened her back and crossed her ankles.<br><br>She beamed.<br><br>Jade looked around the fire, her gaze sweeping slowly across the new formation.<br><br>They faced one another.<br><br>Three women seated on their human mounts, forming a triangle of calm, balanced control around the firelight. A mother, a quiet strategist, and a sweet girl who had found her voice again through reins and command.<br><br>Three leaders.<br><br>Jade gave a slow nod, her eyes gleaming in the firelight.<br><br>“This is how we survive,” she said. “Not by hiding. Not by pleading. But by becoming what they respect.”<br><br>***<br><br>Morning mist hung over the forest just outside the cave, dew glistening on the ferns like droplets of glass. The birds were just beginning to sing as the survivors stirred, the first full day of their new arrangement dawning with quiet purpose.<br><br>Jade stood near their cache of supplies, carefully inspecting the single salvaged ponygirl saddle.<br><br>Emily approached with a thoughtful expression. “We’ll need two more,” she said.<br><br>Jade nodded. “I’ll go out today. Alone.”<br><br>Emily raised an eyebrow. “Alone?”<br><br>Jade glanced over at Winnie, who was sitting nearby, silent but listening.<br><br>“Well, not exactly alone,” Jade said. “I’ll ride my ponygirl.”<br><br>Winnie stiffened, and felt herself blush.<br><br>She knew it was coming.<br><br>She’d agreed to it. Trained for it inside the cave. Even wanted it, in some strange and powerful way.<br><br>But now it was real.<br><br>Jade turned toward her slowly. “Strip, and get on your knees.”<br><br>Winnie obeyed slowly without a word, lowering herself to the stone floor. Her pulse quickened. Her breath came faster, though she tried to steady it. This wasn’t symbolic. This wasn’t a test.<br><br>She was about to be saddled. Bitten. Bound.<br><br>Made into a ponygirl.<br><br>Emily almost gasped as she observed her daughter’s tense surrender.<br><br>Jade stood beside Winnie and unrolled the tack. The saddle’s leather was worn but intact, the straps dark with age and use, but all the pieces had been thoroughly cleaned.<br><br>Jade’s hands were calm, methodical as she placed the chest harness and the saddle on Winnie’s naked body. Her eyes shone—not with pride, or glee—but with quiet reverence at the significance of what she was doing.<br><br>“Arms behind your back,” Jade said softly.<br><br>Winnie complied, exhaling slowly as Jade looped the long leather cuffs around her wrists and buckled them snugly together behind her. The weight of her own arms pulled slightly at her shoulders, forcing her chest forward as she steadied herself on her knees.<br><br>Jade moved with care, checking fit, tightening gently—never too much, but never asking for feedback either.<br><br>Winnie said nothing. She didn’t dare. But she felt her breathing change, as if slightly constrained by the tight harness.<br><br>She was a mount now.<br><br>She was being fitted—and with each new buckle, each pull of a strap, she felt herself disappearing beneath the gear, becoming something new.<br><br>Something meant to serve.<br><br>Jade stepped in front of her at last, and attached the stirrup leathers to the chest harness. Then she looked Winnie in the eyes, holding the bit, resisting the temptation to issue a command. She wanted her ponygirl to spontaneously accept the bit.<br><br>Winnie blinked.<br><br>It was metal. Cool. Cleaned. Strapped to a bridle. She’d seen it before. She’d even held it.<br><br>She opened her mouth, slowly but with resolve.<br><br>Jade slid it gently between her lips, resting it across her tongue. Then she pulled the straps tight behind her head, adjusting until it fit snugly between her teeth. Lastly, she clipped the reins to it.<br><br>When she was finished, Jade stepped back and looked down at her kneeling ponygirl.<br><br>Their eyes met.<br><br>Winnie’s cheeks burned with embarrassment—but beneath it, there was growing pride.<br><br>Jade’s voice came soft and even.<br><br>“Good girl.”<br><br>And despite everything—her aching shoulders, the heaviness of the saddle, the tightness of the bit—Winnie felt the corners of her mouth curl around the steel.<br><br>Because she was a good girl.<br><br>She was Jade’s good ponygirl now.<br><br>The others watched in hushed silence, gathered near the entrance, but Jade’s focus was entirely on the figure kneeling before her.<br><br>Winnie could feel her heartbeat in her ears. <br><br>She was about to be ridden.<br><br>Jade was about to mount her.<br><br>Jade appeared calm, as always, but inside she felt something stir—something powerful, quiet, and solemn. This was not about ownership or cruelty. This was about trust. <br><br>The kind that couldn’t be faked. The kind that had to be proven with action. Under pressure.<br><br>She placed one foot carefully in the stirrup.<br><br>Winnie braced.<br><br>Jade swung her other leg over, careful and graceful, letting her weight settle slowly into the saddle. She eased all the way down, her hips aligning with the curve of the seat, her boots resting gently against Winnie’s abdomen as they found the stirrups. She gathered the reins.<br><br>Winnie inhaled sharply through her nose.<br><br>Jade’s full weight was on her now.<br><br>Every breath made the harness press tighter against her ribs. Every small shift from Jade above caused the saddle to shift minutely, leather creaking, muscles tightening beneath it.<br><br>She was truly beneath a rider now.<br><br>Jade’s hands reached forward and took hold of the reins, running along either side of Winnie’s neck. She applied a firm pressure, that Winnie felt clearly on the corner of her lips.<br><br>“Stand,” she said quietly.<br><br>Winnie obeyed, grunting softly through the bit as she pushed herself upright—first one foot, then the other. The saddle shifted slightly as her spine straightened, the straps pulling snug across her torso. The leather creaked as she stood.<br><br>Carrying Jade.<br><br>Serving her.<br><br>Jade adjusted slightly in the saddle, settling more deeply now that her ponygirl was upright.<br><br>Then, with quiet precision, she gave the reins a soft tug to the right.<br><br>Winnie turned, her movement slow but responsive, her booted feet pressing heavily against the ground. Her head dipped slightly in reaction to the pull, the bit tugging gently at the corners of her mouth.<br><br>Then it came.<br><br>The first command that truly seemed to erase what was left of her dignity.<br><br>Jade gave a quiet click with her tongue, then pushed her feet forward, only to bring them down against Winnie’s abdomen—not harshly, but decisively. The metal spurs dug into her flesh.<br><br>Winnie gasped.<br><br>It was a shock—full of clarity. It was sharp, undeniable. A precise sting, a spark of pressure that said go.<br><br>And she went.<br><br>Her legs moved almost before she thought. She began walking, head bowed slightly, breath fast through her nostrils. The reins bounced softly with her movement, and Jade’s boots remained lightly resting in the stirrups at her sides, the spurs glinting in the morning light.<br><br>Winnie couldn’t even resent it. She couldn’t think.<br><br>She obeyed.<br><br>It was instinct.<br><br>And Jade… Jade felt the surge of control, the seamless bond between thought and movement. She had commanded, and her pony had obeyed. No protest. No hesitation.<br><br>They disappeared into the trees together—rider and mount—on a journey not just to find supplies, but to prove to the world, and to themselves, that this was real.<br><br>Jade rode in silence, her back straight, her face composed—but inside, her heart was pounding with something bright and electric. She was in control now, truly. Not guiding from the ground, not giving instructions in a quiet cave—but seated above, borne forward on the strength of another, her will translated into motion through commands and obedience.<br><br>She breathed slowly, deliberately, keeping her posture regal and still—exactly as a rider should. She knew the goblins respected control. And now, with every step Winnie took beneath her, Jade could feel the truth of it pulsing through the reins in her hands, through the shift of the saddle, through the firm contact of her spurs against Winnie’s naked body.<br><br>She had power.<br><br>Not the loud, crude kind.<br><br>The quiet kind—the kind that came from being obeyed without needing to raise her voice.<br><br>And it thrilled her, leaving her almost breathless.<br><br>She shifted slightly, letting her boots settle again. The spurs dangled, their glint more than decoration. They were her tools—her language. She tested them again, digging them in.<br><br>Winnie flinched slightly but stepped faster without hesitation.<br><br>Jade felt it—a ripple of responsiveness, connecting her will to the heart of her mount.<br><br>This was real. And she loved it.<br><br>Beneath her, Winnie’s world had narrowed.<br><br>Every sense had become about Jade.<br><br>The leather creaked with each movement. The bit pressed snug against the corners of her mouth. The harness bit into her ribs with each breath. Her forearms supported Jade's weight and kept her secure on her back. But none of that shocked her as much as how quickly her body responded to Jade’s commands.<br><br>She wasn’t thinking anymore.<br><br>The reins tugged—she turned.<br><br>The spurs dug into her flesh—she moved. They shocked her. Not as much in pain, but in clarity. The sting wasn’t brutal, but it cut through every other thought. It gave her direction, purpose.<br><br>It told her exactly what Jade wanted—what she demanded.<br><br>And Winnie found herself obeying without resistance. Each time the spurs touched her sides, her legs moved faster, steadier.<br><br>She’s above me, Winnie thought. Because she’s meant to be.<br><br>She had no idea how far they were going. She didn’t know how long they’d be gone.<br><br>But at that moment, she didn’t care.<br><br>She was Jade’s mount.<br><br>And Jade was her rider, in charge of her every movement.<br><br>They moved together now—not just out of necessity, but with rhythm. With purpose.<br><br>Winnie kept her head low, her breaths steady through her nose, the bit still firm between her teeth. The saddle creaked rhythmically on her back, and Jade’s weight, once unfamiliar, now felt… natural.<br><br>Present. Claiming.<br><br>But something else had begun to rise beneath the surface.<br><br>At first it had been a flicker—a strange heat in her belly when Jade shifted her hips slightly in the saddle, when her boot grazed the curve of her flank. Then came the sharp sting of the spurs. Direct. Impossible to ignore.<br><br>Winnie’s breath had caught in her throat the first time it happened. And not from surprise.<br><br>From something else.<br><br>Now, as Jade gently guided her with a light tug of the reins, Winnie couldn’t ignore it anymore. The stir of heat between her thighs. The flush behind her ears. The way her heart beat just a little faster when she felt Jade’s dominance and control. The way her stomach fluttered at every firm, precise command.<br><br>Why? she wondered, confused but unable to deny it.<br><br>Was it the strange thrill of giving herself over? Of not having to decide? Of simply moving because Jade had told her to?<br><br>Or was it Jade herself?<br><br>The softness of her voice, so calm and assured. The weight of her, light but absolute. The way her thighs hugged Winnie’s sides, close and intimate, the spurs swinging like sharp little pendulums of authority.<br><br>It was surrender—not as weakness, but as an offering. A strange, dangerous kind of closeness that wasn’t about words or conversation. It was about serving someone. Feeling them. Being theirs.<br><br>Winnie felt owned. And she had never been so breathlessly aroused in her entire life.<br><br>***<br><br>They entered the town in silence.<br><br>The road was cracked and littered with blackened beams, scattered roof tiles, broken carts, and the silent debris of shattered lives. Soot clung to the walls of hollowed-out homes. What had once been a lively square was now quiet, burned to the bones of memory.<br><br>Winnie slowed beneath Jade’s weight, her legs starting to ache, but steady. She turned her head slightly, eyes scanning the desolation.<br><br>“This is horrible,” she murmured, her voice muffled by the bit. “So much—”<br><br>A sharp tug on the reins.<br><br>Jade didn’t raise her voice, but her tone was colder than usual.<br><br>“Ponygirls don’t speak.”<br><br>Winnie flinched, more from shame than pain.<br><br>Jade didn’t say more. She simply adjusted her seat, resuming the quiet posture of control that now came naturally to her. She was calm, steady, emotionally armored. But inside, her mind was working just as fast as Winnie’s was below her.<br><br>She had been moved by the wreckage—of course she had. But she couldn’t afford sentiment, not now. She had to ride with strength. She had to be seen commanding her mount with effortless authority. That was their protection now. That was survival.<br><br>Besides, she was loving every moment of this. She was a rider.<br><br>They moved through the town, one burned threshold at a time.<br><br>Jade signaled every motion with reins and spurs—never with words.<br><br>Turn left.<br><br>
Slow to a walk.<br><br>
Pick up the pace.<br><br>
Stop.<br><br>Winnie responded to every cue. She obeyed not just without complaint—but with willing precision.<br><br>Every time Jade shifted her weight, she adjusted. Every tug, every kick drew an immediate reaction.<br><br>She’s guiding me like I’m part of her, Winnie thought. And she liked it more than she was ready to admit.<br><br>But not all commands made sense.<br><br>Once, Jade dug her spurs sharply and gave a subtle double-click with her tongue—run. Winnie gritted her teeth and surged forward, boots pounding across blackened cobblestone, chest heaving, legs burning.<br><br>But the distance?<br><br>Only twenty paces.<br><br>Then came a command to stop abruptly.<br><br>Winnie halted with confusion—and frustration. Why make me do that? she thought. It was pointless. Wasteful.<br><br>Another time, Jade pulled her reins sharply to the left when they could’ve gone straight, leading them in a wide detour around a collapsed barrel. They lost time. The path was longer.<br><br>She’s wasting my strength, Winnie thought. She’s making mistakes.<br><br>But then… she reconsidered.<br><br>No, she thought. She’s doing it on purpose.<br><br>Each senseless command, each jarring order—it wasn’t chaos. It was training. Jade was sharpening her instincts. Teaching her to obey, especially when she didn’t understand.<br><br>Not to question. Not to second-guess. Just serve.<br><br>She’s not wasting me, Winnie realized. She’s shaping me.<br><br>The resentment melted into something deeper.<br><br>She’s better than me, Winnie thought. Smarter. Colder when she needs to be. She sees the long game.<br><br>I am just bigger and stronger. I am meant to serve.<br><br>That realization hit harder than any command.<br><br>And stranger still… it kept stirring a warmth in her groins. A tingling pride laced with arousal. Not lust—but something more complex and submissive.<br><br>I want her to use me, she thought. Even when I don’t understand. Especially then.<br><br>Jade kicked her firmly. Move forward.<br><br>Winnie obeyed without hesitation.<br><br>They found a stables building—half-burned, half-collapsed, yet eerily quiet. The ash was undisturbed, as though the violence had passed through like a storm and left nothing breathing behind.<br><br>Inside, two saddles lay among charred support beams and trampled straw, scorched but intact. The leather was stained, but still strong. Nearby, buckled harnesses, rust-specked bits, and discarded tack lay scattered.<br><br>Jade ordered Winnie to her knees and dismounted carefully, landing softly beside her mount with a whisper of boot against ash.<br><br>The moment her weight lifted from the saddle, Winnie felt relief, but also a strange longing.<br><br>She watched Jade move through the wreckage with quiet efficiency, gathering the pieces like a scavenger with a soldier’s discipline.<br><br>“They must be wearing these when they died,” Jade murmured, not to Winnie, not to anyone in particular.<br><br>Jade bundled the tack into two tight sacks, lashing each set of gear—saddle, girth, bridle, and reins—into a compact roll. She tested the straps for wear, adjusting buckles.<br><br>Then she tied the two bundles together, moved behind Winnie, and slung the two bundles over her shoulders, balancing the load so one sack hung down each side.<br><br>Winnie swayed slightly under the added weight, but righted herself quickly. She felt like a beast of burden, her strength available for her rider to use as she pleased.<br><br>Jade gave her a nod of approval, then mounted.<br><br>Her legs settled on either side once more, and she leaned slightly forward, pressing her hand against the top of Winnie’s head.<br><br>“Let’s go back.”<br><br>She made a few more stops along the way, adding provisions and tools to the burden carried by her ponygirl.<br><br>By the time they reached the cave, Winnie’s back ached. Her legs trembled. The saddle creaked with every labored step, the two heavy packs bouncing softly against her ribs. But she never faltered.<br><br>However they were surprised to find the cave empty. The fire was cold. No signs of struggle—but no trace of their companions, either. Just a large number of footprints by the entrance. Perhaps they were taking a practice ride? But why had they not waited for the saddles?<br><br>Winnie lowered herself on Jade’s command, resting on her knees while her rider removed her cargo and then freed her of all the tack.<br><br>It was already late afternoon.<br><br>“We’ll rest here, and hopefully they will show up soon,” Jade said with calm authority. “If not, tomorrow we’ll go find them.”<br><br>***<br><br>They woke up alone the following morning, and Jade saddled Winnie almost immediately.<br><br>They rode for hours.<br><br>The sun had risen, climbed, and begun its slow arc downward again as Jade guided Winnie in wide, careful spirals—searching for their family members and friends. Every pass expanded the radius. <br><br>Every turn widened the circle of hope... or dread.<br><br>Winnie carried her without complaint at first, legs steady, mind focused. She bore Jade’s weight like responsibility.<br><br>But as the day wore on, the journey became harder.<br><br>Jade became impatient, and urged her more.<br><br>Tugged the reins harder.<br><br>Dug the spurs deeper.<br><br>Winnie grunted as the sharp spurs bit into her sides with sharp, commanding jabs. She winced and stumbled forward, trying her best to please her rider with her tired muscles.<br><br>She’s worried about her father, Winnie told herself. She’s just scared. She needs this.<br><br>Then it happened again, just a few seconds later.<br><br>Clink. Clink. Two firm jabs of the rowel spurs, sending shocks through Winnie’s nervous system and leaving small burning cuts on the skin of her abdomen.<br><br>We talked about this. It shouldn’t be my place to question her commands, even when they feel unreasonable…<br><br>Her muscles tightened in response. Her breath hitched. She made her legs move faster, carrying Jade’s weight as best as she could, but she knew her energy was fading.<br><br>Doesn’t she understand that I am exhausted?<br><br>Winnie was trying her best, but Jade was relentless.<br><br>A single jab of the spurs, harder and deeper than ever before. Clink! Winnie felt like screaming at Jade.<br><br>This is unnecessary. This is cruel. Winnie thought bitterly. Why can’t she see I’m doing my best?<br><br>She shook her head, as if trying to take the reins out of Jade’s hands, and then she made a similar movement with her shoulders. She knew it wouldn’t be nearly enough to unsaddle Jade – whose seat was safely supported by Winnie’s cuffed forearms – but she just needed to express her frustration in some way…<br><br>Winnie heard a loud CRACK, and her rump exploded in pain.<br><br>Did she just… whip me??<br><br>Jade had never used her riding crop before. Winnie knew she had been carrying one, but she thought it was just to look more realistic to the goblins...<br><br>It was the most degrading feeling Winnie had ever experienced, immediately followed by two more lashes. Crack! Crack! <br><br>Was she being punished? Or simply pushed to find some extra energy? Either way, Winnie was in shock. Her head jerked slightly. Something inside her simmered.<br><br>She clenched her teeth around the bit, feeling heat rise not from arousal this time, but from growing resentment.<br><br>And yet Winnie obeyed, somehow finding the strength and motivation to increase her pace. She felt as if Jade’s whiplashes had somehow erased her will to rebel, forcing her to submit further.<br><br>Above her, Jade remained quiet—stern, focused. Her gaze flicked across the treetops, the old path, the fading footprints in the dust. She was worried. She was angry. She was afraid.<br><br>And she was pushing too hard.<br><br>My father might be out here, carrying Winnie’s mother, she thought. Or they could be in trouble. And what about Olivia and Archie? We need to keep going.<br><br>She didn’t mean to hurt Winnie—not really. But the whip, the spurs, the pace—they were her only way to move forward.<br><br>To search.<br><br>To stay in control.<br><br>To not fall apart.<br><br>Winnie felt her legs weaken with every step. She was beyond exhaustion. But she kept going, carrying, obeying.<br><br>Because as much as she resented Jade in that moment, she was just as afraid.<br><br>What if something happened to Mom? Or Archie? Or Liv?<br><br>She couldn’t stop.<br><br>The light was dying by the time they returned to the cave.<br><br>Winnie stumbled as they crossed the threshold, her breath ragged, her legs trembling uncontrollably beneath her. The saddle creaked with every unsteady step. Her arms, still bound behind her, ached with sharp, throbbing tension. The pressure from Jade’s weight had become agony hours ago—but she had said nothing.<br><br>Not one word.<br><br>But now… she had nothing left. She fell down onto her knees without being ordered, but Jade chose to let it slip.<br><br>Jade dismounted quickly, her boots hitting the stone floor with a soft thud. She turned at once, unfastening the saddle with urgent hands, then froze when she saw what she had done.<br><br>Winnie’s skin was raw. Angry red welts ran along her flanks where the whip had landed. Countless thin cuts from the spurs laced across her sides, just under her ribs—small, sharp, and bleeding in places. Her skin was flushed, covered in dried sweat and dust. Her lips, parted around the bit, were trembling.<br><br>Tears of pent-up frustration were starting to trace the skin of her sweaty face.<br><br>“Oh gods,” Jade whispered. “Winnie…”<br><br>Winnie dropped to her hands and knees the moment the saddle came free, slumping forward without ceremony. Her body screamed in protest. She could barely hold herself upright.<br><br>Jade knelt beside her and removed the bit carefully, wincing as she saw the deep pink marks it had left on the corners of her mouth.<br><br>“I’m so sorry,” Jade said, her voice hoarse. “I—I wasn’t thinking straight. I got carried away.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t speak. Her eyes were distant. Hurt, but worse than that: quiet.<br><br>“I was scared,” Jade went on. “For my Dad. For your family. I wasn’t trying to punish you. I wasn’t… I didn’t mean to lose control.”<br><br>Still, no reply.<br><br>“I almost never do,” Jade added, softer now, her eyes fixed on the ground. “But today, I did. I thought pushing harder would help us find them. And all I did was—” her voice cracked, “—hurt you.”<br><br>Winnie turned her face away.<br><br>Jade reached out, hesitated, then let her hand fall.<br><br>“I’m sorry,” she whispered again. “Let me take care of you,” she offered, reaching for a sponge and a bucket of water.<br><br>But the silence stayed, and Winnie walked away from her.<br><br>They didn’t talk that night.<br><br>Jade made a fire and sat by it, her arms wrapped around her knees, staring into the flickering light. Winnie curled on her side, facing away, her breathing slow but pained.<br><br>And as the night deepened, Jade laid awake long after Winnie’s breathing had softened into sleep.<br><br>Did I break it? she thought.<br><br>She had built this bond with such care, step by step. Not by force, but by trust. And today, she may have cracked it.<br><br>Maybe even shattered it.<br><br>If she won’t serve anymore… if she won’t carry me…<br><br>The thought knotted her stomach.<br><br>She hated losing control. It was rare.<br><br>She closed her eyes, guilt pooling behind her ribs like cold water.<br><br>And for the first time since the goblins had attacked their village, Jade felt afraid of what she might lose next.<br><br>***<br><br>Dawn crept in gently, brushing pale light across the cave walls.<br><br>Jade hadn’t slept much. Each time she closed her eyes, all she could see was the angry red marks across Winnie’s skin. The bite of the spurs. The sting of the whip.<br><br>And the tense silence that followed.<br><br>She turned slowly now, expecting to see Winnie still asleep—or perhaps gone.<br><br>But she wasn’t.<br><br>Winnie was awake.<br><br>And kneeling.<br><br>Right at Jade’s feet.<br><br>Her hair was tousled. Her lips dry. The faint lines from the bit were still visible at the corners of her mouth, and so were the marks from Jade’s spurs and whip. Her muscles ached from the day before.<br><br>But her expression—calm, steady, open—stopped Jade’s breath.<br><br>Winnie looked up.<br><br>“It’s okay,” she said quietly.<br><br>Jade blinked, unsure she’d heard right. “What do you mean?”<br><br>Winnie lowered her eyes just slightly in humility, then raised them again with quiet confidence.<br><br>“This is what I’ve been training for,” she said. “To obey without questioning. Even when the commands feel unfair. Even when they are unfair.”<br><br>Jade stared at her, stunned.<br><br>“You may have lost control a little bit yesterday,” Winnie continued. “But if I had been in charge… I would’ve lost it completely. I would have screamed. Panicked. Pushed someone until they broke. You didn’t. You just… pushed hard. At times a little too hard, maybe. But that’s not for me to decide.”<br><br>She smiled softly.<br><br>“I trust you.”<br><br>For a long moment, Jade couldn’t speak. She felt something sting behind her eyes: guilt, gratitude.<br><br>Relief.<br><br>“Thank you,” she said at last, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t deserve...”<br><br>“You do,” Winnie interrupted gently. “That’s the point.”<br><br>They shared a quiet breakfast—just a bit of dried meat and water. Neither spoke much. There was no need. The silence had changed. It wasn’t strained anymore. It was settled.<br><br>When they had eaten, Jade rose and dusted herself off, preparing to gather the gear.<br><br>But before she could move, Winnie did something that made her stop cold.<br><br>She walked to the center of the cave. Turned. Dropped to her knees.<br><br>And lowered her head.<br><br>No words. No request. No asking what the plan for the day was.<br><br>She simply knelt.<br><br>Waiting.<br><br>Ready to serve, to obey.<br><br>Jade swallowed hard. Her hands trembled slightly as she reached for the saddle. She touched Winnie’s skin more gently than ever before, while still fastening the straps with firmness. The bit slid into place as the final touch, accepted without resistance.<br><br>When Jade mounted, she did so slowly, with care—letting her weight settle on Winnie's back and cuffed forearms with silent gratitude.<br><br>Winnie didn’t flinch.<br><br>She lifted her body on Jade’s command. Braced herself. Balanced the weight.<br><br>They rode for hours, this time heading straight to the north-west, where Jade thought the goblins had come from.<br><br>Winnie’s muscles still burned from the day before. Her skin was tender in several places, especially where the spurs had left shallow cuts, yet she accepted Jade’s new kicks in the same area as an inevitable part of being ridden.<br><br>Hours later, the path narrowed beneath dense trees, then opened again into a clearing. The ground was damp with yesterday’s rain. Patches of moss glistened. There was no rock, no dry stump, no high root—nothing clean to sit on.<br><br>Jade scanned the area. They hadn’t eaten since morning.<br><br>She ordered Winnie on her knees and slid off her back with care. She removed the saddle and freed her arms, but left the chest harness on.<br><br>Everything was wet.<br><br>And then… she looked back at her ponygirl.<br><br>Kneeling. Waiting. Silent.<br><br>Still strong. Still hers.<br><br>This is part of her training, Jade told herself. She accepted it again this morning, even after I pushed her so hard yesterday.<br><br>She returned to Winnie’s side.<br><br>“On all fours,” she said quietly.<br><br>Winnie obeyed.<br><br>Jade sat on Winnie’s back sideways, both legs folded neatly to one side, skirt draped across her lap. <br><br>She reached into her pack and pulled out a small bundle of wrapped food—dried fruit, a piece of hard bread, a strip of salted meat.<br><br>She sat comfortably, almost elegantly, adjusting herself to settle fully across Winnie’s spine.<br><br>It was a selfish decision.<br><br>She knew it.<br><br>But she also knew it mattered—this moment of casual dominance, of resting on Winnie as if her already overworked body were a piece of furniture for her comfort. She was entitled to use her.<br><br>Beneath her, Winnie shifted slightly. Not in protest—only for balance.<br><br>With one hand supporting the weight and the other holding the food Jade offered her, she was a three-legged stool now.<br><br>And yet… the resentment didn’t come.<br><br>She noticed it, yes. The imbalance. The unfairness of it all.<br><br>Jade could have stood. Sat on a rock. Shared the wet ground with me.<br><br>But the thought passed.<br><br>Flickered and dissolved.<br><br>No. I said I would obey, even when it felt unjust. Especially then. Jade belongs on top of me.<br><br>Jade didn’t speak. She simply chewed, gazing into the woods, letting her weight rest naturally across Winnie’s spine. And Winnie, beneath her, endured. Kept her comfortable.<br><br>Something clicked in Winnie’s mind.<br><br>Like a truth.<br><br>She’s better than me.<br><br>It hit her suddenly, with the quiet force of revelation. It was the only reason why she could bring herself to submit like that.<br><br>Jade wasn’t just the smarter one. The calmer one. The leader in crisis. That was already obvious.<br><br>No… she was meant to be above. Superior.<br><br>And Winnie… beneath.<br><br>Not just by circumstance.<br><br>By nature.<br><br>The realization startled her. Her breath caught for half a second.<br><br>She’d never believed that about anyone before.<br><br>Not her mother.<br><br>Not even her crush, Cassian.<br><br>But now, with Jade sitting calmly on her like a bench, weighing on her back as she ate lunch without apology, without ceremony—Winnie felt it in her bones.<br><br>Jade wasn’t taking advantage of her. She was occupying her rightful place.<br><br>And Winnie?<br><br>She was proud to be used, relied on.<br><br>I am hers.<br><br>Not just her companion. Not just her ponygirl by necessity.<br><br>Her willing slave.<br><br>The word formed silently in her mind and stayed there, heavy and strange and somehow… comforting.<br><br>She belonged to Jade.<br><br>And that made her feel safe.<br><br>Because Jade would know better.<br><br>She always did.<br><br>And I’m strong, Winnie thought. I can carry her. I can take the weight, the pain, the demands. I was made for this.<br><br>She shifted slightly, just enough to give her rider a better seat.<br><br>Jade didn’t comment. She simply crossed one leg over the other, a quiet movement of privilege and confidence, trusting completely in the subservient girl beneath her.<br><br>They sat still, the forest quiet around them.`],
      3: ["Chapter 3", `Winnie’s body trembled faintly with fatigue, but she welcomed it now—savored it. Her breath was steady. Her back straightened with purpose, while keeping a slight bend to be more comfortable for Jade.<br><br>She commands, Winnie thought. I obey.<br><br>Unquestionably.<br><br>It was no longer a vow—it was simply a truth.<br><br>And in that truth, she felt a strange calm. A sense of peace. The ground was cold beneath her palms and knees. The air, fresh. The pressure of Jade’s body across her spine ached and yet it felt right. <br><br>Warm. Anchoring.<br><br>Winnie felt aroused by those thoughts. Not in a crude way. It was deeper than that. A warm thrum of submission humming low in her groins. Not just lust—but longing.<br><br>To serve. To belong.<br><br>Then, from the edge of the clearing, came the soft clop of bare human feet against moss.<br><br>They both heard it.<br><br>Jade sat upright.<br><br>Winnie froze, breathing shallow.<br><br>Through the trees emerged a young goblin. He rode astride a human ponygirl—older, perhaps mid-thirties, her rump scarred with old welts. She carried him steadily, confidently, the reins resting against her neck like they belonged there.<br><br>The goblin boy pulled her to a halt and looked curiously at the two girls in the clearing.<br><br>Jade remained seated, calm and proud, her boots dangling softly from one side of Winnie’s back, her hand resting lightly on her shoulder.<br><br>The goblin gave a small nod of acknowledgment. Then he tapped each of his ponygirl’s breasts with his short riding whip.<br><br>She immediately dropped to her knees in perfect form, folding her legs beneath her and lowering her head.<br><br>He dismounted with the ease of someone who had done it a thousand times.<br><br>He stood in front of them, studying Jade.<br><br>“You are human, but you act like one of us,” he said evenly, his voice slightly accented but clear.<br><br>Jade blinked. “And you speak our language.”<br><br>The goblin raised a brow. “Everyone knows that goblins speak common.”<br><br>His tone wasn’t mocking. Just… obvious.<br><br>Winnie remained motionless. A bead of sweat slid down her cheek, but Jade seemed in control.<br><br>The goblin’s eyes flicked briefly to her, then back to Jade. “Is she yours?”<br><br>Jade paused—only a heartbeat—but then gave a single, composed nod.<br><br>“Yes,” she said. “She is my property.”<br><br>The goblin smiled faintly. “She seems well-trained. You sit like one of us.” He looked genuinely intrigued now. “Where are you heading?”<br><br>Jade hesitated again, calculating. Then: “Following a trail. Some of our group is missing. Perhaps they were taken.”<br><br>The goblin cocked his head. “By us?”<br><br>Jade didn’t answer, trying to read his expression.<br><br>The young goblin removed his ponygirl’s saddle and freed her hands, then tapped her upper arm with his whip.<br><br>The woman—stoic, expression unreadable—immediately lowered herself onto all fours. She adjusted her weight with experience, positioning herself with squared shoulders and straight elbows, forming a living seat just across from Winnie.<br><br>The goblin settled onto her back with a casual sigh, crossing his legs and resting his elbows on his knees as if sitting on a carved stool, not a human being.<br><br>Winnie flinched subtly. She was still bearing Jade’s full weight, her muscles beginning to tremble with fatigue. But she said nothing. She was nothing in this moment but a chair.<br><br>The goblin leaned forward slightly, eyes fixed on Jade. “You fascinate me,” he said. “You sit like us. You ride like us. Why?”<br><br>Jade didn’t blink. “Because your civilization is superior,” she said simply.<br><br>The goblin tilted his head, pleased.<br><br>“We were attacked many times over the years. Eventually we lost our homes,” Jade continued, “but we saw how your kind organized yourselves. The discipline. The clarity of roles. We understood what we lacked. So we have been adapting.”<br><br>She sat a little taller. “We are a small group for now… but we intend to grow.”<br><br>The goblin’s eyes gleamed with interest. “A tribe of human riders.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “With rules. With structure. With respect for what works.”<br><br>The goblin drummed his fingers lightly against his thigh, thoughtful. “That’s rare. Most humans fight us. You... imitate us.”<br><br>“It’s not just imitation,” Jade said. “It’s evolution.”<br><br>The goblin grinned. “Spoken like someone who deserves to sit.”<br><br>Winnie’s breath hitched subtly beneath her. She dared not shift, but the goblin’s words sent a strange flicker of pride through her too. Jade deserved to sit. And she… was there for her, to be sat on.<br><br>Then the goblin leaned in, voice softer. “Come with me,” he said. “To our village. Meet our Chief. He should hear about this… new tribe of human riders. You could become something like an ambassador. Our link to your kind.”<br><br>Jade hesitated.<br><br>She couldn’t trust him. Not fully. But she had no other leads.<br><br>She looked down, feeling the warmth of Winnie’s back beneath her. Still there for her.<br><br>“Very well, I will come,” Jade said.<br><br>The goblin smiled wide. “Good. We’ll ride together.”<br><br>***<br><br>“My name is Tarak,” the young goblin said while saddling his mount. “I am the Chief’s nephew. That means I get to see things before most others do.”<br><br>Jade, checking her mount’s harness, gave a polite nod. “I’m Jade.”<br><br>Tarak swung one leg over his kneeling ponygirl and settled into his saddle with ease. With a soft click of his tongue and a light touch of the reins, she rose fluidly beneath him, strong and practiced.<br><br>Jade mounted Winnie, saddle creaking as her weight settled again across Winnie’s already-aching back.<br><br>Tarak gestured toward the narrow trail that led deeper into the trees. “The village is about two days from here.”<br><br>Jade blinked. “Two full days?”<br><br>“At a steady pace,” he said casually. “Fast walk. Sometimes a trot. Depends how good your mount is.”<br><br>Jade glanced down at the girl beneath her. Winnie’s head was bowed slightly, her mouth closed around the bit, breath already deepening from the earlier strain.<br><br>Still, she moved without question.<br><br>And so they began.<br><br>Jade and Tarak traveled side by side for hours, the path winding through thick forest, climbing shallow hills, dipping into valleys where the moss grew deep and the light grew softer.<br><br>Tarak rode easily, chatting without worry.<br><br>“You sit well,” he remarked. “You’re light on her back. You don’t lean forward too much like beginners do.”<br><br>“I’ve been watching,” Jade replied.<br><br>Tarak grinned. “I can tell.”<br><br>Their conversation drifted—goblin social rules, how mounts were trained, how loyalty was rewarded, how laziness was punished. Jade asked questions when she could, storing every answer like treasure.<br><br>Meanwhile, beneath her, Winnie walked.<br><br>And walked.<br><br>And walked.<br><br>Her arms had gone numb hours ago. The muscles of her thighs and calves burned. Her back ached beneath the saddle, as Jade’s weight relentlessly sank into it. Every step was heavier than the last.<br><br>Tarak said two entire days, she thought. Does he mean… riding all day long?<br><br>Her chest tightened with concern. I won’t make it, a part of her whispered. Not like this. Not every day.<br><br>But still, she obeyed.<br><br>By the time twilight painted the trees in lavender shadows, Tarak pulled his mount to a halt in a small clearing, gesturing for Jade to do the same.<br><br>“Let’s camp here tonight.”<br><br>They dismounted in unison.<br><br>Winnie collapsed to her knees as soon as ordered, barely able to hold herself upright. Her muscles screamed, and her mind swam with exhaustion.<br><br>Tarak untacked his ponygirl with efficiency, and so did Jade. They shared a quick meal, mostly in silence, tired and weary.<br><br>Then Tarak spread a tarp on the ground, and got his ponygirl to lay on her back on top of it. He laid a folded blanket across her body, sat down on it, and then reclined—spreading the rest of the blanket over himself.<br><br>Jade watched, her eyes narrowing in thoughtful surprise, and did exactly the same with her own ponygirl.<br><br>Winnie laid down. She was meant to become a mattress now.<br><br>Treated like furniture, Jade thought. And yet… she seems content.<br><br>Jade unfolded a blanket and laid it across her mount’s chest and stomach. Then, hesitantly, she laid down on top—head against Winnie’s breasts, arm curled across her middle, the blanket wrapping her.<br><br>Winnie’s breath was shallow.<br><br>Jade closed her eyes, feeling the steady rise and fall of her breathing. The heat of her body. The exhaustion. The trust.<br><br>I’m learning so much, Jade thought.<br><br>And in that moment, feeling safe, supported, and deeply grateful, she whispered aloud—barely audible in the night air: “Thank you, Winnie.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t reply. But her lips curved faintly. Every day more, she loved feeling used by Jade.<br><br>***<br><br>The morning mist still clung to the mossy undergrowth when Tarak stretched and rolled off his resting ponygirl, who remained flat on her back like a well-used mattress until ordered otherwise. The forest was quiet. The fire from last night had died down to pale embers.<br><br>Jade stirred on top of Winnie, then slowly sat up. Her back cracked softly, and she rubbed her neck. Winnie hadn’t moved once in the night, despite the ache in her muscles. She had supported her rider.<br><br>Like furniture.<br><br>Like property.<br><br>Tarak was already fastening his ponygirl’s tack again when he looked up and said, casually, “Let’s swap mounts this morning.”<br><br>Jade blinked. “Swap?”<br><br>Tarak nodded. “Just for a few hours. Yours looks raw, like she’s not used to this pace. And you are heavier than a goblin. It will help her recover, while mine works harder under your weight.”<br><br>Jade hesitated. “I...”<br><br>“She’s yours, right?” Tarak said with a grin. “She’ll obey whoever you give her to.”<br><br>Jade could simply not say no. “Of course.”<br><br>Winnie’s heart dropped.<br><br>Swap?<br><br>She had obeyed Jade through fatigue, pain, fear. But this?<br><br>To be handed off to a goblin who had no bond with her? Who had grown up with real ponygirls and knew how they moved, how they submitted, how they behaved under saddle?<br><br>What if he saw right through her?<br><br>What if he knew?<br><br>She was just a girl.<br><br>Not trained. Not bred for this. Totally new to it. Not raised to kneel and obey, to carry and submit. She was a fraud with a saddle on her back and a bit in her mouth.<br><br>And the goblins had raided her village.<br><br>Burned homes.<br><br>Stolen lives.<br><br>She had seen what they were capable of. And now she was supposed to let one ride her?<br><br>Her breath quickened. Panic scratched at the edge of her mind.<br><br>What if he hurts me? What if he punishes me? What if he tells Jade I’m unfit?<br><br>But then—she thought of Jade.<br><br>Of her still, composed posture.<br><br>Of her control.<br><br>And something shifted.<br><br>Winnie closed her eyes. Took a slow breath. And imagined what Jade would do right now.<br><br>She would not panic.<br><br>She would adjust.<br><br>Winnie opened her eyes again, steadied her breath, and let Jade lead her to Tarak. And then, just before the reins changed hands, something clearer took hold of her.<br><br>I am not a fraud.<br><br>I am a real ponygirl.<br><br>I am Jade’s mount. Her property.<br><br>And even when loaned—I represent her.<br><br>Her hands were bound. Her eyes lowered. And when Tarak swung into the saddle on her back, she did not flinch.<br><br>She rose smoothly when commanded.<br><br>Walked when told.<br><br>Turned when the reins nudged her.<br><br>And though every instinct inside her screamed in fear at the unfamiliar weight, the casual sting of a goblin’s spurred boots against her flanks, she did not falter.<br><br>Because she wasn’t acting anymore.<br><br>She was a mount.<br><br>Loaned. But still loyal. Still Jade’s.<br><br>However, Winnie hadn’t realized how much freedom Jade had given her—until it was taken away: Tarak was lighter than Jade. Noticeably so. But he rode heavier.<br><br>His presence on her back wasn’t just weight. It was ownership. Every inch of her body felt constantly observed, monitored, corrected.<br><br>He didn’t speak to her. Not once.<br><br>But she felt him in the reins, in the tightness of his legs, in the rhythm of his subtle, constant cues. Every tiny adjustment of his hips or knees demanded immediate compliance. Every tug of the reins made her turn now, not later. And if she ever hesitated...<br><br>CRACK!<br><br>The whip.<br><br>Deliberate.<br><br>Not brutal, but without mercy.<br><br>He was also pretty harsh with his spurs. The first time he jabbed them in, she gasped through the bit, her flanks instinctively tightening. <br><br>With Tarak there was no room for tiredness. No room for confusion.<br><br>Only obedience.<br><br>He expected perfection. Submission.<br><br>And she gave it to him.<br><br>Not because she wanted to—but because she had to.<br><br>Because she was Jade’s.<br><br>On the other hand, riding Tarak’s ponygirl was easy for Jade. The human mount was incredibly responsive and well trained.<br><br>Every reaction to her commands was immediate, perfect, balanced.<br><br>This is what it’s supposed to feel like, Jade realized. Total control.<br><br>There was no hesitation. No second-guessing. No emotion.<br><br>It was impressive.<br><br>And yet… It was also empty. There was no spark of recognition. No loyalty. No flicker of feeling. Just obedience.<br><br>She was a tool, seemingly without a soul.<br><br>Winnie’s not this precise. Not this trained.<br><br>But Winnie chooses her obedience.<br><br>Winnie feels.<br><br>Winnie belongs.<br><br>Still, the experience taught Jade something valuable—about posture, rhythm, responsiveness. She studied it all. Filed it away.<br><br>Because Winnie could learn those things too.<br><br>And when she did?<br><br>She would be unstoppable.<br><br>***<br><br>The sun had reached its peak, and Jade was about to suggest they stop for a quick lunch when Tarak, still astride Winnie, pulled his mount to a halt and grinned over his shoulder.<br><br>“Let’s break the monotony,” he said. “Short race. See what your girl can do.”<br><br>Jade raised an eyebrow. “A race?”<br><br>“To that tree,” he said, pointing to a massive oak at the far end of a straight, shaded stretch of forest path. “Circle it and return here.”<br><br>He dismounted and unfastened the saddle bags from Winnie’s flanks with fluid ease, dropping them to the ground as a marker. “She’s strong,” he added. “I can feel it. And you’re heavier than I am, with my more experienced ponygirl, so it might be interesting.”<br><br>Jade hesitated for only a breath.<br><br>She dismounted and crouched beside Tarak’s saddle bags, watching how he detached the straps. Then she moved to her own temporary mount and carefully removed the bags herself. They dropped to the mossy earth with a soft thump.<br><br>Her jaw tightened with determination.<br><br>I’ll look the part. I’ll act the part. I’ll be a rider he’ll respect.<br><br>She swung herself into the saddle with smooth control and gathered the reins in one hand.<br><br>Across from her, Tarak was securely mounted on Winnie.<br><br>Jade could see it in Winnie’s face: the tightness around her eyes, the slight tremble in her thighs.<br><br>She was afraid. But ready.<br><br>She knew what was coming.<br><br>Tarak was not going to hold back.<br><br>And Jade… couldn’t afford to.<br><br>“Ready?” Tarak called out.<br><br>Jade nodded, lowering her body slightly in the saddle.<br><br>The moment Tarak shouted, “Go!”—everything exploded into motion.<br><br>CRACK!<br><br>Winnie yelped through her bit as Tarak’s whip struck her side and his spurs jabbed hard into her abdomen in a double burst of pain.<br><br>She leapt forward, dirt kicking up beneath her feet as she galloped with wild urgency, driven by pure survival and pain.<br><br>Jade felt her own mount tense—hesitating for only a heartbeat.<br><br>She snapped the whip once and dug in with her spurs—not cruelly, but firmly enough to demand effort.<br><br>The goblin-trained ponygirl responded.<br><br>She surged into motion, boots pounding against the earth, body coordinated, efficient, powerful.<br><br>Jade crouched forward, balanced and focused, urging her mount to close the distance.<br><br>But ahead—Winnie was flying.<br><br>Driven hard, pushed mercilessly, tears welling in her eyes, she thundered down the trail, heart pounding, breath shallow, every nerve on fire.<br><br>Tarak guided her with ruthless commanding energy. Each tug, each slash of the whip or jab of the spurs sent jolts through her.<br><br>Winnie endured.<br><br>She wasn’t just running.<br><br>She was proving something.<br><br>To Jade. To Tarak. To herself.<br><br>I’m a real mount.<br><br>They neared the tree, Tarak shouting sharply. Winnie turned tightly, nearly stumbling from the sharp tug of the reins and the sting of the whip on her naked rump.<br><br>Jade followed, her mount circling the tree with perfect balance, closing the gap.<br><br>She had been holding back.<br><br>As the final stretch opened ahead of them, Jade dug her spurs in again and again, urging her mount forward—faster, faster—and the ponygirl managed to pull up right next to Winnie.<br><br>On the final stretch she also gave her the whip. Repeatedly. Mercilessly.<br><br>They crossed the makeshift finish at nearly the same moment, but Tarak threw up one fist with a boyish grin.<br><br>“I win.”<br><br>“I am not so sure about that,” Jade replied with a smirk.<br><br>Tarak dismounted and patted Winnie’s flank.<br><br>She collapsed to her knees, panting, shaking.<br><br>Jade swung off her own mount and immediately walked toward Winnie.<br><br>Tarak looked down at her, still grinning. “She’s got fire. Just needs a bit more training.”<br><br>Jade didn’t answer right away. She crouched beside her own mount—her Winnie—and placed a hand gently on her shoulder.<br><br>“You were amazing,” she whispered.<br><br>Winnie looked up at her, eyes glassy with exhaustion, pain… and pride.<br><br>She had raced like a real ponygirl.<br><br>***<br><br>The forest clearing was small and damp when they stopped for lunch. Tarak dismounted first, and with the casual authority of one who didn’t need to explain himself, he ordered his ponygirl on all fours.<br><br>Winnie obeyed without hesitation.<br><br>Tarak sat down on her back and unwrapped his provisions—some dried meat, a wedge of dark root bread, and a thin flask of water.<br><br>Jade followed suit, crossing her legs neatly at the ankle as she took a comfortable seat on Tarak's ponygirl.<br><br>Their lunch was quiet—efficient. No praise, no thanks. Only weight and silence.<br><br>The ride resumed soon after, returning to their original pairings: Jade on Winnie, Tarak on his own ponygirl.<br><br>At first, Winnie felt relief. Her familiar rider. Her rightful place.<br><br>But she was tired, and Jade felt heavier than ever before.<br><br>The forest trail twisted upward into long, sloping inclines, and the air turned heavy with the press of heat through the branches. Hours passed. The rhythm of footsteps blurred together. Jade remained quiet above her, but her body told the truth.<br><br>And when Winnie slowed—just slightly—the spurs became more cruel.<br><br>Clink.<br><br>Then again.<br><br>Clink. Clink.<br><br>Jade was riding her hard, with an unforgiving attitude. With necessity.<br><br>Winnie’s legs trembled with each stride. Her arms were numb. Her vision blurred at the edges. And her mind… her mind was beginning to splinter.<br><br>She wasn’t angry.<br><br>She understood the pressure Jade was under. The expectations. The need to match Tarak’s pace. The need to appear worthy.<br><br>But her body was failing her.<br><br>And her thoughts were fraying.<br><br>I can’t do this.<br><br>I’m going to fall.<br><br>I’m going to fail her.<br><br>She wanted to cry—but even that took energy she didn’t have.<br><br>So instead—she searched.<br><br>Where is it? That thing… the thing that keeps me going.<br><br>She closed her eyes for a step. Two.<br><br>And there it was.<br><br>From the cave.<br><br>The memory Jade had asked her to focus on.<br><br>Her feet.<br><br>Winnie pictured them again—small, graceful, smooth. Feet that were not meant for mud or pain or wear. Feet that belonged in stirrups, clean and wrapped in leather, resting against her flanks. Directing her.<br><br>Marking her with the sharp spurs.<br><br>I carry those feet, she told herself. I keep them off the ground. That’s my role.<br><br>She breathed.<br><br>She’s commanding me with them now.<br><br>Another sharp jab from the spurs. Jade’s feet were Winnie’s masters, and they were commanding her to work harder.<br><br>Winnie gasped—but stepped harder.<br><br>Faster.<br><br>Her back straightened just a little more.<br><br>Those feet are not supposed to walk. They rule.<br><br>And I am supposed to carry.<br><br>She didn’t smile. She didn’t cry.<br><br>But her spirit steadied—just enough to take the next step.<br><br>And the one after that.<br><br>And the one after that.<br><br>But the trail had grown cruel.<br><br>Each step Winnie took felt like lifting a mountain. Her legs wobbled beneath Jade’s weight, her breath shallow, her mouth dry around the bit. The image of Jade’s feet—soothing, motivating—had carried her through the last hour, but even that image now flickered like a dying flame.<br><br>She had never felt closer to breaking.<br><br>Then Jade did something unexpected.<br><br>“Tarak,” she called, voice composed. “Let’s take a short break. My back’s starting to get tight.”<br><br>Winnie’s stomach twisted. Is she disappointed in me? Can she feel that I’m failing?<br><br>Tarak gave a shrug. “Sure.”<br><br>Jade dismounted without a word and immediately began removing the saddle. With practiced efficiency, she unbuckled the girth, loosened the harness, and freed Winnie’s arms. Then she stepped back, letting the saddle thud gently onto the forest floor.<br><br>“On your back,” she said softly.<br><br>Winnie obeyed without thinking, dropping down and rolling onto her back. With taps of her whip, Jade instructed her to bend her knees and place her feet flat on the ground. <br><br>Winnie’s body felt like it was collapsing in slow motion, breath ragged, muscles on fire.<br><br>Jade retrieved a light blanket from the saddlebag and, with unhurried care, laid it across Winnie’s sweat-slick abdomen and thighs. Then, without ceremony, she stepped forward and sat down.<br><br>Right on her belly.<br><br>Winnie gasped at the sudden pressure, but said nothing.<br><br>Jade leaned back against her bent thighs like they were the backrest of a low lounge chair, arms stretching behind her, spine relaxing with a subtle sigh.<br><br>“I just need to loosen my back a little,” she said aloud—for Tarak’s benefit, clearly. “She’s still strong. I just need a better angle to rest.”<br><br>Winnie blinked.<br><br>She’s protecting me. Pretending I’m not the one who needs the break.<br><br>And then Jade did something else.<br><br>She leaned forward, reached down, and calmly pulled off her boots.<br><br>Her bare feet, damp from hours inside the tight leather, emerged slowly, toes flexing in the open air. Without hesitation, she placed them—warm and glistening—right on Winnie’s flushed face.<br><br>Winnie froze.<br><br>What is she doing? Is this a punishment? A form of humiliation?<br><br>The scent was sharp. Musky. The salt of her sweat clung to Jade’s soles. It filled Winnie’s nose.<br><br>But then—something clicked.<br><br>She’s helping me focus.<br><br>Jade was giving her something. Not a command. Not a burden.<br><br>A gift.<br><br>A way back to her mantra. To her anchor.<br><br>These feet do not walk. They rest. They rule.<br><br>With trembling lips, Winnie parted her lips and let Jade’s foot press gently against her tongue. She hesitated for only a moment… then she licked.<br><br>The salt of sweat filled her senses. It was real. Raw. Grounding.<br><br>She licked again. And again, holding Jade’s feet with her hands to keep her comfortable.<br><br>Her tongue moved with reverence.<br><br>She swallowed, and with each breath, each slow stroke of her tongue along the arch of Jade’s foot, the burning in her legs, the weight in her chest—faded. Not completely. But enough.<br><br>This is why I serve.<br><br>This is why I carry her.<br><br>She no longer imagined her rider’s feet.<br><br>She tasted them.<br><br>Worshipped them.<br><br>Her tongue moved along every inch of Jade’s bare soles, tasting the sweat that clung to the delicate arch and the creases near her toes. The taste was earthy, salty—utterly human. And yet to Winnie, it was more than that.<br><br>It was sacred.<br><br>She cleaned each foot methodically, from heel to ball, her breath warm against the skin. Jade remained still, her weight centered on Winnie’s belly, one hand resting on her thigh, the other absently twirling a strand of hair as if she were sitting on any ordinary piece of furniture.<br><br>But she wasn’t.<br><br>She was seated on her ponygirl.<br><br>Her devoted slave.<br><br>And she was letting her reach a new level of submission.<br><br>Winnie licked under each toe, curling her tongue around them, gently sucking one after the other until no trace of sweat remained. Her mouth ached slightly, her lips dry, but she didn’t stop.<br><br>She didn’t want to stop.<br><br>When Jade finally drew her feet back and rose, slipping back into her boots and stepping lightly off her mount’s body, Winnie felt strangely empty—like the act of worship had held her together.<br><br>But she had what she needed now.<br><br>The memory was stronger.<br><br>The taste lingered in her mouth.<br><br>Jade buckled the saddle back into place without a word, checking every strap. She slid the bit back into Winnie’s mouth, tightening the bridle with gentle efficiency, then she mounted with authority.<br><br>“Up,” she said softly.<br><br>And Winnie rose.<br><br>Not quickly—but without hesitation.<br><br>The ride resumed, the trail narrowing into a long corridor of mossy stone and overhanging branches. Tarak led at a steady pace, as if nothing unusual had happened during their break.<br><br>Winnie moved cleaner. Firmer.<br><br>She still ached. Her legs still burned. But every time Jade’s spurs kissed her skin—she pushed harder.<br><br>Those are commands from the feet I worship.<br><br>With the taste of her Mistress’s foot sweat still fresh on her tongue, she found the strength to carry her until sunset.<br><br>Tarak was quiet for a while.<br><br>But as they passed a fallen tree, the path narrowing, he finally spoke.<br><br>“So…” he said with an edge of curiosity, “the foot thing.”<br><br>Jade glanced sideways at him, raising an eyebrow.<br><br>He smirked faintly. “Using your mount’s mouth to clean your feet. I’ve never seen that. We don’t do that.”<br><br>Jade didn’t flinch. “That’s because goblins train tools,” she said calmly. “But I’m training devotion.”<br><br>Tarak’s grin widened a little, intrigued. “Is that what it was? Devotion?”<br><br>Jade nodded, straight-backed in the saddle. “Humans are different. Our mounts aren’t forced into the role. They have to choose it. Embrace it. And the only way to bind a ponygirl completely is not just through discipline… but through worship.”<br><br>Tarak looked forward again, quiet for a moment. “And the way you sat on her earlier—on her belly, back against her thighs?”<br><br>“She was in position,” Jade said simply. “It’s called the lounge-chair posture.”<br><br>“Never seen that before either.”<br><br>“It’s effective and comfortable,” Jade said smoothly. “It teaches them stillness under weight. Emotional calm. Physical trust.”<br><br>Tarak made a small, thoughtful sound.<br><br>He tilted his head again. “Is that what you’re building, then? A human tribe of riders? With mounts that kiss your feet and sleep under your body?”<br><br>Jade didn’t hesitate.<br><br>“Yes,” she said. “Because it works.”<br><br>He chuckled. “Maybe you’ll also teach us something after all.”<br><br>***<br><br>They arrived in the early afternoon of the following day.<br><br>The trees thinned gradually, the forest floor giving way to packed earth and wide clearings crisscrossed with tracks and bootprints. Ahead, rising from a shallow rise in the terrain, stood a wooden palisade—thick, curved, and dotted with lookout posts manned by armed goblins. A tall iron gate stood open at the center.<br><br>Beyond it, life moved in vibrant, ordered motion.<br><br>Jade sat tall in her saddle, eyes sharp. Beneath her, Winnie slowed slightly, her breath heavy from the morning’s steady march—but she kept her posture strong, her head lowered, the bit steady between her teeth. Her feet thudded rhythmically against the packed earth.<br><br>Tarak turned back toward them, grinning. “Welcome to Irgrak. The Chief’s hall is at the center.”<br><br>Jade nodded once.<br><br>They passed through the gate without challenge.<br><br>Inside, the town unfolded in layers of unfamiliar but astonishing structure. Narrow roads curved around domed houses and squat, windowless buildings. Stone paths ran alongside the market stalls where goblin merchants sold iron tools, leather tack, and bundles of herbs.<br><br>And everywhere—everywhere—there were riders.<br><br>Goblin women and men, young and old, moved gracefully through the crowd on the backs of their human ponygirls.<br><br>Jade's presence turned heads.<br><br>A human riding another human, high and straight-backed, her reins looped around her wrist, her spurs gleaming faintly in the sunlight.<br><br>More than a few goblins slowed as they passed. Some murmured. One pointed. Tarak just smirked and kept riding ahead, parting the crowd like a local prince.<br><br>Winnie’s heart thudded wildly in her chest.<br><br>She wanted to look around—wanted to take in every sight, every sound—but the bit forced her head low, and Jade’s weight on her back kept her focus grounded. Her feet were sore, her spine aching, her muscles stiff, but she kept moving.<br><br>She had to. They were among them now. Surrounded by true ponygirls—leaner, faster, more seasoned.<br><br>And she had to measure up.<br><br>Jade could feel her trembling faintly beneath her. She tightened the reins just slightly and leaned forward to whisper, “You’re doing beautifully. Just like them. Stronger, even.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer—couldn’t.<br><br>But her next steps were firmer.<br><br>They turned a corner and passed through the central market: a long, busy plaza lined with hanging banners and shaded stalls. A line of goblin children trotted behind a matronly rider on a tall, red-haired ponygirl.<br><br>They rode deeper into the heart of Irgrak, toward the Chief’s hall, flanked by curious stares and quiet murmurs.<br><br>Jade watched it all, stunned.<br><br>Not with fear.<br><br>But with recognition.<br><br>This wasn’t savagery. It was a civilization. A hierarchy with rules. Roles. Respect.<br><br>And she was no longer just imitating it.<br><br>She was part of it. She could fit.`],
      4: ["Chapter 4", `The courtyard was quiet and solemn, with small planted trees and playful fountains. <br><br>At the far end stood a large, raised chair carved from dark wood, fitted with curved armrests and a hide-cushioned seat — clearly the Chief’s outdoor throne.<br><br>Tarak’s ponygirl was tapped on each breast by his riding crop. She dropped onto her knees, instantly bending the leg on whose side she had just been tapped. <br><br>A few light taps on her shoulders followed, guiding her body gently downward, until her forehead pressed against the floor. Her arms remained behind her back, braced by the leather cuffs, and her spine bowed into a perfect arc of subjugation.<br><br>Tarak shifted in his saddle, lifting his knees to free his legs and then resting both of his feet squarely atop the crown of his ponygirl’s bowed head.<br><br>The gesture looked casual, but it radiated mastery.<br><br>As always, Jade observed and learned. Without a word, she imitated his commands. On the last tap of Jade’s whip, Winnie hesitated only for a second before lowering herself fully, forehead to the floor.<br><br>The cold stone sent a shiver down her neck.<br><br>Then — weight, as Jade’s boots unapologetically settled on the back of her head.<br><br>Winnie flinched, just slightly. Not from pain.<br><br>From the symbolism.<br><br>She was beneath Jade in every way.<br><br>Like a thing.<br><br>And as she held still in that humiliating pose, muscles trembling, forehead kissing stone, the thoughts came flooding in.<br><br>This is where I’ve ended up.<br><br>Serving the physically soft, pale-skinned petite girl who used to hide behind her sketchbook. The girl who never raised her voice. The one everyone overlooked.<br><br>And now? Jade was her rider. Her owner, entitled to using her in new and more objectifying ways every single day.<br><br>Winnie had carried her for miles without rest. Obeyed reins. Answered the whip. Taken the relentless sting of the spurs. Swallowed Jade’s foot sweat as she licked her clean.<br><br>Like a slave.<br><br>Winnie also felt more naked than ever before. She had quickly grown accustomed to the nudity required by her subservient role, helped by the fact that goblin-ridden naked ponygirls had become a very familiar view in recent times. But now, in that position, she was intimately exposed to anyone who happened to be behind her.<br><br>The shame was sharp for a moment — a rush of heat in her cheeks. Her pride, somewhere deep inside, thrashed in protest. It had not happened in a little while.<br><br>But it passed.<br><br>It always passed.<br><br>Because in this new world, Winnie’s role — humbling, exhausting, degrading — made sense in a way nothing ever had before.<br><br>She was Jade’s legs. Her platform. The source of her comfort and superiority.<br><br>And the deeper she fell into her subservience, the more complete she felt.<br><br>A heavy door creaked open with purpose, and the room fell into immediate silence.<br><br>Footsteps echoed — slow, firm, unhurried — and then the Chief of Irgrak entered.<br><br>She was a striking figure: not tall, but commanding nonetheless. Her broad hips swayed beneath layers of embroidered leather, her curved belly resting with matronly confidence beneath a gilded chestplate. Thick rings adorned her fingers, and her hair — dark and coiled — was gathered into a braided crown. Her eyes, sharp as obsidian, scanned the room without needing to speak.<br><br>This was a goblin used to being obeyed.<br><br>Tarak bowed his head as she approached the throne.<br><br>“Chief Magnessa of Irgrak,” he announced, voice respectful. “May I present Jade of the human tribe beyond the ridge — rider of her own kind.”<br><br>Jade gave a short bow, neither submissive nor arrogant.<br><br>Winnie remained prostrated beneath her, forehead still on the floor.<br><br>Chief Magnessa sat with ease, her generous body settling into the throne like it was made for her alone. She took a moment, examining Jade and Winnie with a shrewd eye, then gave a faint nod.<br><br>“You ride like one of us,” she said.<br><br>Jade met her gaze. “We have studied your ways.”<br><br>Magnessa smiled slightly, but her eyes stayed cool. “And why?”<br><br>“Because they work,” Jade replied. “Order. Structure. Discipline. Your people command strength through clarity. My people... seldom understood that in the past.”<br><br>The Chief leaned back, lacing her fingers over her stomach. “Are your people broken?”<br><br>“They’re scattered,” Jade said. “Afraid. We were attacked by goblin raiders multiple times.”<br><br>Magnessa didn’t react.<br><br>“We saw what your society was,” Jade continued. “And we saw what ours lacked. So we began adapting.”<br><br>She gestured slightly toward Winnie, who still knelt beneath her, motionless.<br><br>“This is my mount. I trained her. She obeys reins, whip, spurs. She is completely submissive to me. She carries me all day long.”<br><br>Magnessa tilted her head. “And she does this willingly?”<br><br>Jade nodded once. “She chose to kneel. And she chooses to obey. Every day.”<br><br>Magnessa’s gaze flicked to Winnie’s bowed form, and for a moment, something like interest softened the lines of her face.<br><br>“She is certainly not the first human to kneel in my town,” she said. “But you, Jade from beyond the ridge, may be the first to ride in as a master.”<br><br>She leaned forward slightly. “Tell me, how many others are like you?”<br><br>“Only a few dozens for now,” Jade improvised. “But that can change.”<br><br>“And what is it you want?”<br><br>Jade’s reply was measured. “Recognition. Coexistence. My tribe will grow. Our way of living will spread. And it will spread faster if you allow us to trade with you. To learn. To serve where appropriate — and lead where earned.”<br><br>Magnessa studied her for a long, quiet moment.<br><br>Then she smiled — not kindly, but with interest.<br><br>“You are young. You are ambitious. And you speak like someone who has already ridden far.”<br><br>Her eyes drifted again to Winnie.<br><br>“And if your ponygirl is as obedient as you say... I may allow you to prove yourself.”<br><br>She snapped her fingers once.<br><br>A servant stepped forward with a scroll and a wax seal.<br><br>Magnessa looked at Jade.<br><br>“For now, you will be a guest of Irgrak. We will observe you. We will see if your rider’s tribe deserves a place at our table.”<br><br>Jade bowed slightly. “Thank you, Chief Magnessa.”<br><br>Magnessa leaned back, voice like velvet over stone. “My nephew Tarak will be our liaison. You are dismissed.”<br><br>***<br><br>They rode through the heart of Irgrak without ceremony.<br><br>Jade sat tall in her saddle, reins in hand, as Winnie carried her past watchful eyes and curious glances. Tarak led on his own mount, relaxed and satisfied, guiding them toward the edge of the marketplace, where the stone streets gave way to a small square with a tavern and its adjacent stables.<br><br>The sign above the door read The Stirrup’s Rest, and it bustled with goblin patrons drinking, shouting, laughing.<br><br>As they approached, a groom in a sleeveless leather tunic emerged and gave a short bow. “I’ll take your mounts.”<br><br>Tarak dismounted smoothly and handed off his reins without hesitation.<br><br>But Jade held hers tight.<br><br>“I’ll be keeping mine with me,” she said calmly.<br><br>The groom blinked. “You’ll… bring her inside?”<br><br>“Yes. She belongs with me.”<br><br>The tavern manager, a stout goblin woman with bright eyes and quick hands, heard their conversation and stepped out from behind the bar at the open wall. She gave Jade a sharp, skeptical once-over.<br><br>“Rooms are not stables,” she said. “Your girl will make a mess.”<br><br>“She won’t,” Jade replied evenly.<br><br>The woman raised an eyebrow. “Even so. We don’t allow mounts in the guest quarters.”<br><br>Jade’s voice stayed smooth. “This one isn’t just a mount. We are both human. Our bond is different. Closer.”<br><br>“Sounds a little too close, if you ask me,” the woman muttered. <br><br>A small human on all fours appeared next to her feet. She was clearly some kind of pet.<br><br>“My mount is also my pet. She’ll stay quiet and low, moving on all fours whenever we are indoors,” Jade continued, improvising. “But I will keep her with me,” she concluded firmly.<br><br>A long pause.<br><br>The manager scowled — but saw the seal of the Chief in the token hanging from Tarak’s belt.<br><br>“Fine,” she snapped. “But if I see her standing upright for one second, she sleeps in the hay.”<br><br>Jade gave a polite nod. “Agreed.” <br><br>Then she freed Winnie’s arms and made her crawl obediently behind her, carrying her full tack and the saddlebags.<br><br>Tarak followed them into the tavern for a glass of ale, then they took their leave for the day.<br><br>Winnie followed Jade up the steps and through the narrow corridor. The stairs creaked beneath her tired hands and knees.<br><br>A nice room was waiting for them.<br><br>Spacious by goblin standards. One broad window, a thick mattress on a wooden frame, a small table and two stools. Soft afternoon light filtered through the shutters.<br><br>And then the door closed behind them. For the first time in days, they were alone.<br><br>Winnie remained on her hands and knees in the center of the room. Her arms trembled slightly — not from fear, but from exhaustion, uncertainty.<br><br>Jade stood just a step away, looking down at her, breathing slowly.<br><br>Neither spoke at first.<br><br>Winnie looked up, just enough to meet her eyes.<br><br>The weight of the last days hung between them — unspoken, but undeniable.<br><br>For a long moment, the only sound in the room was the slow breath of two girls who had come too far to pretend nothing had changed.<br><br>The silence between them wasn’t empty. It was full. Full of what they’d done. What they were. What they were becoming.<br><br>Jade took a slow step forward and lowered herself to her knees — not beside, but before Winnie.<br><br>“I want to see you,” she said softly. “The real you. Not the saddle. Not the bridle. Just you.”<br><br>Winnie blinked, caught between confusion and awe.<br><br>Jade’s hands moved gently — not like a rider commanding a mount, but like one girl reaching out to another who had carried her through so much. She unbuckled the straps, letting the saddle ease off Winnie’s back, placing it carefully to the side, freeing Winnie of her tack until she was completely naked.<br><br>“You never broke,” Jade whispered. “Even when I pushed you hard. Even when I shouldn’t have. You carried me further than I deserved.”<br><br>Winnie opened her mouth, but no words came. Just a tight breath.<br><br>Jade reached out, brushing a damp strand of hair behind her ear.<br><br>“Now let me take care of you.”<br><br>There was a wash basin near the window — lukewarm water drawn in a heavy pitcher, a folded cloth nearby. Jade filled the basin, soaked the cloth, and knelt again in front of Winnie.<br><br>Gently, she began to wipe her skin.<br><br>Her chest first — sore, red with harness lines.<br><br>Then her arms, where the leather of the cuffs had chafed under Jade’s weight in the saddle.<br><br>Then her flanks, where the spurs had left a multitude of bloody marks.<br><br>Winnie shivered, but didn’t pull away as Jade groomed her thoroughly, tenderly.<br><br>“I couldn’t do any of this without you,” Jade whispered.<br><br>Winnie opened her mouth again.<br><br>And this time, she found her voice.<br><br>“I know,” Winnie said, voice shaking. “But… I want to serve you. Today, and always.”<br><br>Jade sat on a low chair near the window, the last sliver of afternoon light casting warm gold across the floorboards. She leaned forward slightly, unbuckling the straps of her tall leather boots, working them loose with tired hands.<br><br>She didn’t notice Winnie moving at first.<br><br>Until a soft pressure touched her bare ankle.<br><br>She looked down.<br><br>Winnie had crawled to her. Not hesitantly, not questioning.<br><br>Just certain.<br><br>She lowered her head and pressed a kiss to the top of Jade’s foot — then another, a little slower.<br><br>Then her tongue flicked gently across the side of the arch, collecting the thin sheen of sweat from the long ride.<br><br>“Winnie…?” Jade said softly, her voice unsure, surprised — but not stopping her.<br><br>Winnie didn’t lift her head.<br><br>She licked again — long, reverent strokes — then paused, her lips still resting on the top of Jade’s foot.<br><br>And then, her voice: “Please… I need this.”<br><br>Jade blinked.<br><br>Winnie’s eyes stayed down. “I need to submit to you… completely.” Her voice trembled, but not from fear. “Not just when others are watching. Not just when you are in the saddle.”<br><br>She swallowed hard, kissed Jade’s foot again.<br><br>Jade watched her in awe — still, quiet, breath shallow.<br><br>“You deserve someone who never pretends, someone who truly lives to serve you” Winnie whispered. “You are not like the others. You are brilliant. You saw this world for what it is before any of us did.”<br><br>She licked again — slower this time, as if to make the point.<br><br>“You deserve the best ponygirl in the world.”<br><br>She paused. “I’ll try to be that… and more…”<br><br>The silence between them ached.<br><br>And then Jade — still barefoot, still seated — reached forward with slow hands, fingers brushing gently through Winnie’s hair.<br><br>She said nothing at first.<br><br>She just touched her.<br><br>Not as a rider asserting dominance…<br><br>But as a girl receiving something rare.<br><br>A show of devotion not demanded — but offered.<br><br>Willingly. Entirely.<br><br>Finally, she whispered, “Thank you.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer.<br><br>She didn’t need to.<br><br>Her tongue moved again, slow and steady — worship in motion.<br><br>And Jade sat back, letting it happen, relaxing as Winnie took her feet into her hands and continued to clean them with gentle, eager strokes of her tongue. It was no longer shy or tentative — it was devoted. Grateful.<br><br>Jade met her gaze — calm, composed, but no longer passive.<br><br>She shifted slightly in the chair.<br><br>Then she pressed her foot firmly against Winnie’s lips.<br><br>“Open.”<br><br>Winnie obeyed instantly.<br><br>Jade slid her toes into her mouth.<br><br>“Good girl,” she murmured, voice low now, riding the fine line between warmth and command.<br><br>Winnie’s lips sealed around her rider’s toes, her cheeks hollowing slightly as she sucked, slow and deliberate. Her tongue moved instinctively between them, drawing out the last traces of sweat and dirt, polishing them with reverent care.<br><br>Jade's breath deepened. Her other foot slid along Winnie’s collarbone, nudging her to stay low, stay focused.<br><br>After a few minutes, Jade pulled her foot gently free.<br><br>She let the dampness cool in the air before resting both feet in Winnie’s lap.<br><br>“I accept your submission,” she said quietly.<br><br>Winnie looked up again, her face flushed, her eyes bright.<br><br>“And I’ll treat you accordingly — not just when others are watching. If you want to be mine… really mine… then yes. You’ll be beneath me. Always.”<br><br>Winnie nodded. “Yes. That’s what I want.”<br><br>“But,” Jade continued, her tone softening, “you will still think for me. Especially when we’re alone: you’ll be the one beneath me — but also the one who listens and helps me reflect.”<br><br>Winnie blinked, then nodded again, this time slower.<br><br>“I’ll serve you however you ask.”<br><br>Jade smiled. “Then let’s start now.”<br><br>She patted her own lap.<br><br>Winnie shifted without needing more direction, placing her head on Jade’s thighs and guiding her rider’s bare feet gently into her own lap as she knelt. She cradled them like something precious.<br><br>Jade exhaled — her first true breath of relaxation in days.<br><br>“So,” she said. “What did you think? Of the city. Of the Chief. Of… all of it.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t look up — her hands remained focused, steady — but her voice was thoughtful.<br><br>“They are more advanced than I expected,” she said. “The way they organize their riders, the training, the social order. It’s not just force. It’s culture.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “Agreed.”<br><br>“And Chief Magnessa…” Winnie hesitated. “I think she respects you. But she’s cautious. You’re an outsider, yet you ride like one of them. That makes you valuable — but also potentially dangerous.”<br><br>“And Tarak?”<br><br>Winnie frowned slightly. “He admires you. And he sees some kind of opportunity from all this. But I think he wants to see if you can lead. Really lead. Not just ride.”<br><br>Jade ran her fingers absently through Winnie’s hair.<br><br>“I’m not afraid of being tested,” she murmured.<br><br>“I know,” Winnie said softly. “And I’ll be beneath you every step of the way.”<br><br>***<br><br>Jade stood beside the washbasin, the fabric of her tunic slipping loose as she undid the ties along her side. <br><br>The flickering lamplight painted soft shadows along her collarbone, her arms, the subtle curve of her waist. Her skin, pale from years spent drawing in corners instead of running wild, seemed to shimmer in the warm air of the room.<br><br>Winnie couldn’t look away.<br><br>She felt it like a pulse — low, silent, impossible to ignore.<br><br>Not just lust.<br><br>Worship.<br><br>Jade pushed the tunic off her shoulders, letting it fall quietly into the chair behind her. She was naked in front of Winnie for the first time, but she tried her best to maintain her composure.<br><br>She reached for the washcloth, dipping it into the fresh basin of water she’d drawn for herself.<br><br>And then she paused.<br><br>Winnie had crawled forward, almost without realizing it — her movements soft, quiet, instinctual. She knelt again at Jade’s feet and pressed a gentle kiss to one. Then the other. Reverent. Humble.<br><br>Jade looked down — startled, but not alarmed.<br><br>Winnie’s lips moved upward, slow, cautious, deliberate — kissing the slender line of Jade’s ankle, then the soft inside of her calf. Her hands remained on the floor, her posture low and open, not claiming, not demanding. Just offering.<br><br>Her lips slowly reached Jade’s knees.<br><br>Then her thighs.<br><br>And then — Jade’s hand grabbed her hair.<br><br>Firm. Not cruel. Just enough to stop her.<br><br>Winnie froze.<br><br>The room held its breath.<br><br>Jade’s voice was soft, but unshakable.<br><br>“This isn’t one of your duties.”<br><br>Winnie swallowed hard.<br><br>Jade let the silence linger — not to punish, but to feel what was really happening between them.<br><br>“I don’t want to use my power to take something so personal from you,” she said. “Not like that.”<br><br>Winnie tilted her head upward. Her eyes glistened from her intense desire.<br><br>“I want this,” she whispered. “More than I have ever wanted anything.”<br><br>Jade searched her face for doubt — found none.<br><br>Still, she hesitated.<br><br>“Why?”<br><br>Winnie’s answer came without words.<br><br>She leaned forward and pressed her lips again to Jade’s thigh — not hungrily, not with urgency — but with peace.<br><br>With certainty.<br><br>With the quiet joy of someone who had found exactly where she belonged.<br><br>Jade watched her for a moment longer. Then she sat on the chair and let her hand relax. She smiled faintly, one corner of her mouth lifting. “You really do adore me…”<br><br>Winnie looked up and nodded, smiling in return.<br><br>And then, without a word, she returned to what she had started, diving with her face between Jade’s buttery thighs, savoring the taste of her intimacy, kissing and licking and pleasuring Jade with every ounce of energy she had left.<br><br>And Jade… Jade let herself receive.<br><br>They both lost any concept of time. A Goddess and her worshipper.<br><br>When Jade stepped away and returned to the washbasin, the sky was dark and the water had gotten cold. <br><br>She dipped the cloth again and began washing herself slowly, rinsing away sweat, dust, and the heat of the day. Her motions were thoughtful, methodical — but it wasn’t long before she felt movement behind her.<br><br>Winnie had knelt again.<br><br>Not to worship this time, but to help.<br><br>Like an eager maid with purpose, she reached for a dry cloth and held it up without speaking. Jade looked down and smiled softly.<br><br>Winnie simply moved in — gently wiping Jade’s arms dry, then her shoulders, her back, her legs. She handled each part of her with quiet care, as if Jade were something precious and divine that needed tending — from below.<br><br>Jade didn’t resist. She let herself be cared for.<br><br>When the towel had done its work, Jade moved to the bed and folded back the covers.<br><br>She looked at Winnie.<br><br>“Come.”<br><br>Winnie hesitated.<br><br>She remained on her knees by the chair, fingers resting gently on the leather of Jade’s discarded saddle.<br><br>“To bed?” she asked quietly, as if unsure she’d heard right.<br><br>Jade nodded. “Yes. With me.”<br><br>Winnie looked up — torn between longing and the need to remain in an inferior position.<br><br>Jade patted the mattress decisively. “Come lie beside me, now.”<br><br>Winnie rose slowly and climbed carefully onto the bed. She lay down on her back, stiff at first, unsure where her hands should go, how small she should try to make herself.<br><br>Then she felt Jade move.<br><br>Without a word, Jade climbed atop her and rested her body gently across Winnie’s, her head tucked just under her chin, her face resting on Winnie’s soft breasts.<br><br>The same way they’d slept in the woods.<br><br>But this time, there was no blanket between them. Just two naked bodies.<br><br>Winnie exhaled slowly. Her arms wrapped naturally around Jade’s back, drawing her closer. Jade’s breath was warm against her neck.<br><br>Their chests rose and fell together.<br><br>Their legs aligned.<br><br>Their pulses slowed.<br><br>Lovers.<br><br>Master and servant.<br><br>Mind and muscle.<br><br>They could be all of it.<br><br>Sleep came gradually — as soft as breath, as natural as submission.<br><br>And in the dark, Jade’s last thought was one of gratitude.<br><br>***<br><br>The morning light poured in through the latticework windows of The Stirrup’s Rest, warming the stone walls and wooden beams in a soft, amber glow. The tavern buzzed quietly — a few early patrons sipped broth or chewed rootbread, while stablehands moved in and out carrying buckets, harnesses, or trays.<br><br>Jade descended the stairs with composed grace, freshly dressed, hair neat, boots polished. Her presence already drew subtle glances — not from surprise anymore, but from recognition.<br><br>Behind her, Winnie crawled in silence. Completely naked, except for her chest harness.<br><br>She moved with her head low, arms steady, thighs sore from the days of riding, but her pace never faltered. Her eyes stayed downcast. The wooden floor beneath her palms was cool, reminding her that she was far from home — and yet exactly where she belonged.<br><br>She wanted to be seen like this.<br><br>As Jade’s pet.<br><br>Jade scanned the room and selected a table near the center — not tucked in a corner, not hidden in the shadows. Prominent. Visible. She strode to it without hesitation.<br><br>A few goblins looked up — recognizing her as the human rider. Still a novelty. Still watched.<br><br>Jade reached the table.<br><br>She did not speak.<br><br>She snapped her fingers once, crisp and quiet.<br><br>And Winnie knew.<br><br>Without a sound, she moved forward, turned, and positioned herself on all fours beside the table, perfectly square, perfectly still.<br><br>A moment later, Jade sat on her back.<br><br>Her weight settled with confidence, not as a test, but as a statement.<br><br>Around the room, a few murmurs rose — quickly stifled.<br><br>Yes, some goblins had brought their human pets to the tavern. But none had been used like this. None were made into furniture indoors. It just seemed bizarre for some reason.<br><br>Jade adjusted her position slightly, crossing one leg over the other. Her breakfast arrived — a bowl of warm porridge, a strip of grilled root meat, and tea steeped in bitter leaves.<br><br>She sipped slowly, eyes calm, posture poised.<br><br>And she knew what she was doing.<br><br>Let them watch, she thought.<br><br>Let them see what it means when a human rider trains her mount with devotion and pride.<br><br>Tarak arrived not long after Jade had settled into her breakfast. He paused as he reached the table — then raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.<br><br>“You’re using her as a chair in the tavern now?”<br><br>Jade didn’t turn. She simply reached for her tea.<br><br>“Yes,” she said calmly. “It’s efficient. And dignified, I think.”<br><br>Tarak’s brow lifted with amusement as he took the seat opposite her. “And here I thought goblins were the decadent ones.”<br><br>A goblin waiter arrived, glancing between the two humans, clearly unsure where to look.<br><br>“I’ll have another bowl,” Jade said, without looking up. “For my mount. On the floor, just here.”<br><br>The waiter hesitated. “The… floor?”<br><br>“Yes,” Jade said. “It’s part of the human tradition. She eats like this. On all fours, beneath me.”<br><br>The waiter blinked, then nodded stiffly and left.<br><br>Tarak leaned on one elbow, smirking. “You’re building a culture around it already.”<br><br>“I’m reinforcing loyalty,” Jade replied evenly. “And discipline.”<br><br>“Aren’t you afraid to upset the Chief?”<br><br>“I think she respects strength.”<br><br>Tarak chuckled, clearly entertained.<br><br>They ate in quiet conversation for a while, the sounds of the tavern soft around them. When the bowl for Winnie arrived — placed on the floor between her hands like a dog’s — she picked it up with one hand and ate without hesitation, never once breaking posture even as her other hand had to sustain more of Jade’s weight.<br><br>Tarak gave her a long, sideways glance, then looked back at Jade.<br><br>“I’m meeting with some colleagues later this morning,” he said. “Nothing formal. But I think it would be useful if you joined us. Show them who you are.”<br><br>Jade wiped her fingers on the cloth, calm. “Where?”<br><br>“There’s a house up on the northern slope,” Tarak replied. “We’ll ride.”<br><br>“Very well.”<br><br>They finished their meal, and Jade rose gracefully from her chair — from Winnie — who crawled back immediately into position behind her. They passed through the tavern again under the curious stares of a few other guests, the sight of a human crawling after her rider already starting to register not as scandal… but as novelty.<br><br>A new order.<br><br>Upstairs, Jade changed into a fresh tunic and fastened the harness around Winnie’s chest, then cinched the saddle into place with the ease of her recent practice. Once ready, she led Winnie out through the back courtyard. <br><br>Winnie shifted down on her knees, and Jade mounted.<br><br>Tarak joined her on his own ponygirl, and with a light tug of the reins, they rode together — Jade side by side with him, upright and proud, her mount walking steadily up the road.<br><br>The path to the house was steep, weaving through rows of small goblin farms and shaded trees. By the time they reached the old wooden homestead nestled near the ridge, the sun had warmed the air, and Winnie’s breath had begun to deepen.<br><br>They dismounted at the gate.<br><br>A stablehand emerged from the house and reached instinctively for the reins of both mounts. “I’ll take them into the stable.”<br><br>“No,” Jade said.<br><br>The stablehand froze.<br><br>“My ponygirl comes with me.”<br><br>He looked at her in confusion. “Inside the house?”<br><br>“Yes,” Jade said evenly. “She remains at my side, on all fours like a pet. That is the human way.”<br><br>Tarak didn’t intervene.<br><br>The stablehand looked at him, but he merely gave a half-shrug and said, “Apparently, that’s how they do it.”<br><br>Jade’s eyes stayed fixed. “If I’m to be treated as an equal, then my customs must be respected too.”<br><br>There was a pause.<br><br>Then the stablehand stepped back. “As you wish, Milady.”<br><br>Jade freed Winnie’s arms and removed the saddle, leaving it to the care of the stablehand. Then she began to walk.<br><br>And Winnie, on all fours, followed her proudly yet humbly through the doorway.<br><br>The interior of the house was warm and inviting — high ceilings supported by polished beams, thick woven rugs underfoot, and the scent of smoked herbs lingering in the air. It was clear this was the home of someone well-positioned, if not outright powerful. Low, luxurious couches ringed the center of the main hall, cushioned with dyed leather and trimmed in brass.<br><br>Tarak led the way inside, nodding to the goblins already gathered. They sat or lounged casually — five in all — dressed not in armor or field gear, but in robes, sashes, and tunics rich with color and embroidery. These were thinkers. Planners.<br><br>Jade took in the room carefully. Then, as her host gestured to an empty couch, she raised a hand.<br><br>“No need, thanks,” she said calmly.<br><br>Then she turned to Winnie, and snapped her fingers: a gesture that had become a generic demand of service and obedience, with the exact meaning to be understood by Winnie depending on the situation.<br><br>Winnie promptly got down on her hands and knees, and Jade sat on her bare back with the same quiet authority she’d shown at the tavern — crossing one leg over the other, her hand resting gently on Winnie’s shoulder.<br><br>There were a few exchanged glances.<br><br>But no objections.<br><br>The meeting began with polite greetings. Names exchanged. One older goblin introduced himself as Malgrin, and a plump female in her forties as Sena. A younger one — restless and sharp-eyed — was called Vekk. Their tones were thoughtful, reserved, but curious.<br><br>Tarak sat with one arm across the back of his couch, watching them speak.<br><br>“We’ve been following your emergence in town,” Sena said. “And I hear that your presentation to Chief Magnessa… left an impression.”<br><br>“And not just on her,” added Malgrin. “You’ve stirred the city. A human girl riding another human… with discipline. With command. It’s unheard of.”<br><br>“But not impossible,” Vekk said quickly. “And that’s the point.”<br><br>Sena nodded, then turned her attention fully to Jade.<br><br>“We are a minority bloc, but with growing influence,” she explained. “We believe the future of goblinkind lies not in enrichment through bloody raids, but in power through structure, diplomacy, and example.”<br><br>“The old guard sees humans as prey,” said Malgrin. “Weak-minded. Soft. Useful only for their girls and their labor.”<br><br>“But you’re changing that,” Vekk added, eyes fixed on Jade. “You showed that humans can structure themselves like we do. That they can rule. That they can inspire obedience on their own.”<br><br>They all looked to Winnie now — silent, unmoving beneath Jade.<br><br>“And that changes everything,” Sena said.<br><br>Jade’s voice was calm. “So what do you want from me?”<br><br>Malgrin folded his hands. “We want you to keep doing what you’re doing. But we also want you to speak — when the time comes — as a representative of your kind. Not all of humanity. But your strain.”<br><br>“Girlriders,” said Sena. “Humans who understand structure. Order. Connection through submission.”<br><br>Vekk leaned forward. “As a girlrider, you are already perceived as almost one of us. That gives you power. Influence. Your disciplined mount proves it.”<br><br>Jade looked down at Winnie — who remained still, her breath calm, her back firm beneath her owner.<br><br>“And what do you offer in return?”<br><br>Sena smiled. “Protection. Respect. And, if we succeed… a world where your kind of humans aren’t hunted, but respected.”<br><br>Malgrin added: “Those who ride… and those who carry.”<br><br>Jade was quiet for a long moment.<br><br>Then she placed her hand more firmly on Winnie’s shoulder, not for dominance — but for connection.<br><br>“I will play along,” she said. “But please be aware that I won’t just serve your vision. I will lead my own.”<br><br>***<br><br>The days passed like slow, heavy steps through a ritual.<br><br>Each morning, Jade descended the tavern stairs with Winnie crawling silently behind her on all fours. Winnie was Jade’s pet and human chair indoors, her mount in the streets, her maid and submissive lover in the room above the tavern.<br><br>At night, Jade would sit on the edge of the bed and say nothing. Winnie would wordlessly unbuckle her boots, wash her feet with her mouth, massage her calves, kiss the arches with slow reverence. <br><br>And when Jade allowed it, Winnie offered herself completely, acting selflessly worshipful. There was no resentment left in her. Only devotion.<br><br>And Jade, though composed in public, felt the intimacy between them deepening into a kind of mutual love that was difficult to define.<br><br>She grew comfortable as a receiver of adoration and pleasure, and she allowed Winnie to hump her leg and foot like a pet in heat, demanding that the increasingly subservient girl ask for permission before reaching her own orgasm.<br><br>During the day, Jade was an increasingly demanding rider. She needed to explore every corner of the goblin town, and of course she wouldn’t do any of that on her own feet.<br><br>The search began in the southern market ring, where traders sold tools, clothing, and riding accessories. Jade rode Winnie from stall to stall, stopping at every merchant who looked like they might have overheard a transfer, a transaction, a sale. She showed them a drawing of Olivia’s face. She asked about her Dad – an unusually tall and large man with a long beard – and Winnie’s mother Emily, describing her as a woman with auburn hair with two teenage children.<br><br>Most simply shook their heads. Others tried to demand a price for information. None had real answers.<br><br>By noon, they turned toward the leather yards, then circled the fruit and grain lanes, where human mounts were sometimes sold.<br><br>Winnie bore Jade’s weight without complaint — enduring hour after hour of short walks, sudden halts, sharp turns and countless times kneeling and standing. Jade dismounted, asked for information, and showed the drawing. Then she mounted again. And on they went.<br><br>That night, Winnie’s thighs burned, and her knees throbbed.<br><br>The second day was worse.<br><br>Jade directed them toward the eastern pens, where she had found out that goblins bought and sold human mounts openly — rows of cages, holding pens, and raised platforms where inventory was displayed.<br><br>Most of the humans were already broken in spirit. Some stared back defiantly. Almost all were women, restrained with reins or wearing auction tags pierced through noses, ears, breasts or even cheeks.<br><br>Again, Jade dismounted and remounted dozens of times, finding that most goblins were already intimidated by her size to begin with, and even more so if she sat on Winnie’s back.<br><br>She walked slowly past each pen, calling softly: “Dad? Emily? Archie? Olivia?” <br><br>Winnie stayed outside the gates when required — tethered like a goblin mount, enduring the curious stares and occasional touches from goblins passing by.<br><br>In one yard, Jade watched an auction unfold — girls lined up in harnesses, reins clutched by handlers, goblin buyers seated in high-backed chairs.<br><br>She studied every face.<br><br>Jade sketched portraits of all their family members, asking Winnie to help her recall details.<br><br>They used the sketches like calling cards as they worked through the public and private stables on the north side of the city — facilities that ranged from clean, organized longhouses to filthy cages.<br><br>Each time Jade approached a stablemaster, Winnie would lower herself onto her knees, her back glistening with sweat, her arms strapped.<br><br>They were met with a mix of suspicion and curiosity. But the goblins understood what Jade was doing — and many gave her more respect than she expected. She was almost one of them now, riding her human mount.<br><br>Still, there were no leads. <br><br>The problem was that goblins didn’t seem to care much about what the faces of their mounts looked like. They recognized them more easily through piercings, tattoos and brands.<br><br>Their next day was spent in the private courtyards, where high-status goblins traded mounts off-market — favored girls rarely seen by the public, held in quiet corners or training houses.<br><br>Jade had to use charm, tact, and sometimes coin to be let in. Winnie was often required to kneel in display – with her forehead on the ground – to prove that Jade was a rider of equal standing as any goblin.<br><br>In one such estate, they were led past a row of restrained girls in ceremonial tack. Jade asked again. Described her Dad, the mother with two teenagers.<br><br>No one knew them.<br><br>At the end of the day Winnie, aching in every joint, began the long walk back to the tavern. Jade rode in silence. She didn’t dismount until they reached the private stall behind the building, where she slid down and leaned her head against Winnie’s shoulder.<br><br>“We searched everywhere,” she whispered.<br><br>Moments later, Winnie was crawling behind her toward the room.<br><br>***<br><br>On the fifth day, Tarak invited Jade to have lunch with him at the tavern.<br><br>Winnie, without needing to be told, dropped into her chair posture on all fours and braced for Jade to sit. Jade did so gracefully, crossing her legs over Winnie’s spine as she accepted a plate of grilled grain cakes and hot broth.<br><br>Tarak bit into a strip of dried root meat and leaned in slightly.<br><br>“I have news.”<br><br>Jade kept her eyes down, focused. “Go on.”<br><br>“The Chief has approved an expedition,” he said. “You, me, Malgrin, and Sena. We’ll ride out together—four riders, four mounts. We’ll travel to the southern foothills and make contact with your settlements. Offer diplomacy. Observe.”<br><br>Jade nodded slowly. “When?”<br><br>“In a day or two.”<br><br>Jade took a measured sip of tea.<br><br>And beneath her calm, a knot began to form in her stomach.<br><br>The only other human riders she knew were Emily and Olivia, who were inexperienced and missing.<br><br>The story she had told, again and again, was that of a rising human order: humans who rode, who understood goblin principles and built on them.<br><br>What if that story collapsed the moment they crossed the border?<br><br>Still, she didn’t let it show.<br><br>She placed her spoon down gently and met Tarak’s gaze.<br><br>“Give me three days,” she told him. “I need time to prepare properly. And… I’ll need some silver.”<br><br>He grinned, and nodded.<br><br>Jade gave him a tense smile.<br><br>And beneath her, Winnie remained steady — her body warm, her breath calm.<br><br>Everything was built on this.<br><br>On her.<br><br>And Jade would ride forward with pride—until the world she had promised would find a way to become real.`],
      5: ["Chapter 5", `Jade sat on the edge of the bed, her boots off, her feet resting on Winnie’s thighs as the taller girl knelt on the floor and sat on her own heels.<br><br>Winnie knew exactly how Jade needed her right now.<br><br>Not to carry.<br><br>Not to serve.<br><br>But to listen.<br><br>“I don’t know how we’re going to do this,” Jade said softly, staring at the floorboards.<br><br>Winnie didn’t speak.<br><br>Jade inhaled slowly. “Tarak, Sena, Malgrin… they think we are on the verge of something big. That there are others like us—perhaps even whole communities of human girlriders and willing mounts.”<br><br>She looked up, eyes distant. “But they don’t exist. Not yet. Only us.”<br><br>Winnie blinked, then tilted her head slightly in concern.<br><br>Jade continued, voice quieter. “I believe it can exist. That it should. But it’s too soon. The idea is still forming. And if we ride into a random town, traveling with three mounted goblins…”<br><br>Her voice darkened.<br><br>“They’ll panic. They’ll see monsters, and possibly consider us traitors. They’ll grab pitchforks. They’ll fight back.”<br><br>Winnie stayed silent for a long moment, absorbing it all.<br><br>Then she spoke.<br><br>“I think I know a place,” she said softly. “A place we could go first, where they might listen and consider before judging.”<br><br>Jade looked at her.<br><br>“There’s a school,” Winnie continued, eyes lifting now, cautious but clear. “A private academy, with students ranging from 19 to 22 years old. Elmsworth. It’s an elite place. Very progressive. My cousin Beth goes there.”<br><br>Jade frowned. “A school?”<br><br>Winnie nodded. “For girls like her—wealthy families, forward-thinking teachers, lots of idealism. If anyone is going to have an open mind about the principle of what we are trying to build, it’s them.”<br><br>Jade sat back slowly.<br><br>“They don’t believe in violence. They teach philosophy. Ethics. Structure. If we approach them as envoys, not raiders…”<br><br>She met Jade’s eyes fully now. “They might actually listen.”<br><br>Jade was silent.<br><br>Then she exhaled through her nose—a long, slow breath.<br><br>“That could work.”<br><br>Winnie nodded once. “It’s a long shot. But it’s the only human place I can think of that’s designed to ask questions before they grab weapons.”<br><br>Jade leaned forward, resting her hand gently on Winnie’s shoulder.<br><br>“Thank you,” she whispered.<br><br>Winnie lowered her gaze again, and began rubbing Jade's legs and feet with devotion. “I serve your mind, as well as your body.”<br><br>Jade smiled faintly.<br><br>And for the first time since Tarak's news, she felt the knot in her chest loosen.<br><br>They had a plan.<br><br>***<br><br>On the next morning, Jade rode Winnie through the winding lanes of Irgrak’s merchant quarter, weaving between stalls and shaded shops like any goblin rider.<br><br>She sat tall in the saddle—chin high, reins loose in one hand, her heels resting lightly against Winnie’s flanks. She could hear the sound of the coin pouch dancing in her satchel, and she was eager to spend the entire sum that Tarak had provided for the trip preparation.<br><br>Winnie trotted dutifully beneath her, bit between her teeth, wrists cuffed behind her in the simple harness. Her movements were fluid, automatic, accepting the weight without complaint. When Jade dismounted outside each storefront, she tied Winnie’s reins to a post—next to other tethered mounts, goblin-owned human girls.<br><br>No one questioned it. They were becoming a familiar sight.<br><br>They reached the one shop Jade had most anticipated: Garn & Stitch — Fine Riding Equipment, Custom Fit.<br><br>Inside, the smell of oiled leather, brass polish, and beeswax filled the air. Saddles of every size and type lined the walls, from minimalist goblin field tack to ceremonial gear adorned with gold.<br><br>A stocky, gray-bearded goblin with square spectacles stepped out from behind a counter.<br><br>“Morning,” he said. “Looking for anything special?”<br><br>Jade walked with purpose to the nearest row of saddles. “I need something human scale. For a longer-legged rider.”<br><br>He raised a brow. “Ah. You must be the human girlrider.”<br><br>“That’s right.”<br><br>She moved past two narrow goblin-sized saddles and placed her hand on a medium-width black one with a gently sloped seat and reinforced girth strap.<br><br>“This one.”<br><br>He adjusted his spectacles. “You’ve got a good eye. That’s our long-haul touring model. More room in the seat, built for spine support.”<br><br>“Perfect.”<br><br>He gestured toward the adjoining harness display. “Chest rig to match?”<br><br>Jade nodded. “And integrated cuffs for the ponygirl’s wrists, of course. I don’t want the saddle shifting during movement.”<br><br>The goblin stroked his chin. “Then you’ll want the forearm version. More stable for long rides. It supports the rider’s center of gravity better.”<br><br>Jade added, “Stirrups too.”<br><br>He selected a pair. “These can be clipped to breast rings. More comfort, better swing. You can feel every nuance in the gait.”<br><br>Jade studied them. “I’ll think about that. In the meantime, you can clip them to the chest harness.”<br><br>She reached for her coin pouch.<br><br>“Oh… and of course, I will need bit and reins to match.”<br><br>Out front, Winnie was waiting at the hitch post, head lowered, reins slack. Jade untied her gently, then led her into the shaded fitting yard beside the shop. The goblin saddler followed with a padded bench and the selected tack.<br><br>“Let’s get her fitted.”<br><br>Winnie dropped to her knees without needing to be told.<br><br>She knew this was for her.<br><br>The saddler worked quickly and professionally. First came the chest harness—broad leather straps wrapping around Winnie’s torso, each buckle adjusted with exacting care.<br><br>“Arms back,” the goblin said.<br><br>Winnie obediently crossed her wrists behind her back.<br><br>The saddler placed the saddle on Winnie’s back and slipped her forearms into the integrated cuffs, fitting them snugly. He gave a small tug to test the tension. She didn’t flinch, but she realized that the new cuffs blocked her entire forearms, making her chest stick out even more.<br><br>“Good girl,” he muttered, almost under his breath. “Seems very docile.”<br><br>Jade smiled and nodded.<br><br>Every strap was tightened, and the saddle settled on Winnie’s back like it belonged there. The contour hugged her shoulder blades. The girth strap passed under her chest, cinched tight but not cruel.<br><br>Jade stepped forward, watching every movement.<br><br>“How does it feel?” she asked softly.<br><br>Winnie looked up and nodded, knowing better than to speak in public.<br><br>“Looks like it was made for her,” the saddler said, still acting like a salesman.<br><br>Jade placed her hand gently on Winnie’s back. “No,” she said. “It was made for me.” And Winnie was made to carry it, to carry her.<br><br>The saddler gave the final checks, then he added the stirrups, bit and reins. Finally he stepped back.<br><br>“She’s ready. Break it in slowly. It’s a top quality saddle and your pony is strong—you’ll get good mileage.”<br><br>Jade nodded, and paid the agreed price. Then, with one smooth motion, she mounted. The saddle fit her perfectly. Deep, comfortable, balanced.<br><br>She settled her boots into the stirrups, and off they went.<br><br>The saddler’s shop was only a few storefronts away from their next destination, yet Jade made no move to walk. Instead, with her new saddle perfectly fitted beneath her, she gently tugged the reins and nudged her spurs into Winnie’s sides.<br><br>Winnie obeyed instantly, trotting forward with steady rhythm, her cuffs now snug behind her back, the new harness supporting the weight she carried with pride. She felt the contours of the saddle pressing more evenly against her shoulders, and Jade’s seat — secure and balanced — made every stride feel earned.<br><br>They arrived at the next destination: a neat little shop with green awnings and a polished wooden sign that read "Tahril’s Foot & Fitters – Custom Footwear for Rider and Mount."<br><br>Jade dismounted gracefully, tying Winnie to the hitch post once again — this time with a firm but respectful pat on her shoulder.<br><br>“I won’t be long.”<br><br>Inside, the scent of tanned leather and oil was stronger, mixed with soft hints of beeswax polish and cedar shavings. Shelves and pegs along the walls displayed rows of boots, sandals, and gaiters — designed for goblin riders and their human ponygirls.<br><br>A lean goblin woman with thin fingers and a keen gaze stepped forward from behind the counter.<br><br>“Looking for something practical but with high quality,” Jade said. “One pair for myself. One for my mount.”<br><br>The shopkeeper studied her for a moment, then nodded. “Size?”<br><br>Jade lifted her foot slightly. “I’m slightly above average — for a goblin shop. Extra-large sizes might fit.”<br><br>The shopkeeper retrieved a few options: finely stitched leather ankle-boots with reinforced heels and stirrup-guard flares. One pair bore embossed patterns and gleaming buckles — clearly the fanciest of the lot.<br><br>Jade pointed to it without hesitation. “These.”<br><br>The shopkeeper smirked. “These are classy, yet comfortable. Planning to walk far?”<br><br>“I don’t plan to walk at all.”<br><br>“Ah, of course.”<br><br>Jade followed her to the other wall, where all kinds of sturdy boots for ponygirls were displayed.<br><br>“I want something comfortable and… indestructible,” she said. “She carries me everywhere, often over long distances. She needs a good grip. Wide sole.”<br><br>She examined a few pairs, then selected a low-cut, tough-soled model with reinforced stitching and leather lacing that tied securely around the ankle.<br><br>The shopkeeper nodded in approval. “A good choice. They flex well for all kinds of terrain. Durable and strong, but not stiff.”<br><br>“I’ll take them. We just need to find the right size: my ponygirl is right outside.”<br><br>Jade added a few tunics to her purchase — plain but well-stitched pieces in goblin “extra-tall,” which fit her trim human frame more closely than most human-made clothes ever had.<br><br>By the time she stepped outside, she was a vision of authority in her new boots, her fresh tunic flowing slightly in the breeze.<br><br>She untied Winnie’s reins, looking at the new boots that the shopkeeper had fitted on Winnie’s feet while Jade got changed.<br><br>The leather molded quickly to Winnie’s skin, snug and protective.<br><br>Jade placed her foot in the stirrup and mounted once more. Winnie got up and stepped forward proudly, her new boots gripping the cobblestone path perfectly.<br><br>Jade guided Winnie through the winding roads back toward the tavern.<br><br>She sat tall and relaxed in her new saddle, the high-quality leather groaning gently beneath her weight with each step that Winnie took. Her new boots — polished and pristine — rested comfortably in the stirrups, the soft clink of buckles and straps steady in rhythm with her ponygirl’s movements.<br><br>Winnie trotted beneath her, steady and smooth, her new boots gripping the road with purpose. Nothing had been said aloud, but both of them knew: today had been a statement. They no longer looked like outsiders trying to blend in.<br><br>They belonged.<br><br>But then—Jade stopped Winnie.<br><br>Suddenly. Sharply.<br><br>She pulled the reins tight with a short, crisp motion that made Winnie halt mid-step, her breath catching in her throat. She looked up, just enough to see Jade’s head turned sharply to the right, her gaze fixed on something in a nearby shop window.<br><br>Metal.<br><br>Gleaming.<br><br>Jade ordered Winnie on her knees and dismounted without a word.<br><br>Winnie remained in place, shoulders rising and falling as she calmed her breathing. She could see it clearly now: a display of spurs arranged in a velvet-lined case behind the glass. Each pair gleamed with polished silver or blackened steel, some with modest knobs, others with star-shaped rowels sharp enough to flick sparks.<br><br>Jade tied Winnie’s new reins to a post, then she opened the door and stepped inside.<br><br>The shopkeeper, a tall goblin with a leather apron and fingers stained with polish, looked up.<br><br>“You’ve got a fine eye,” he said as Jade approached the case. “These here,” he gestured to a slender set with etched silver stars, “are for show. Stylish. Decorative.”<br><br>Jade’s gaze shifted downward.<br><br>“To ride,” the shopkeeper continued, “you’ll want these.”<br><br>He opened the case and removed a pair of low-mounted rowel spurs with a firm neck and sharply cut edges. The steel gleamed — not in ornamentation, but in intent.<br><br>Jade picked one up. Turned it in her hand. Ran a delicate finger along the rowel’s teeth.<br><br>“They seem… assertive,” she murmured.<br><br>“They’re decisive,” the shopkeeper replied. “Only one notch below enforcement-grade. You don’t use these if you want to ask.”<br><br>Jade’s eyes narrowed slightly.<br><br>She looked up. “I’ll take them.”<br><br>“And perhaps… a new whip?” The shopkeeper was clever and observant. He had probably noticed that the riding crop hanging from Jade’s wrist by its loop was well worn.<br><br>Jade considered it.<br><br>Then gave the faintest smile.<br><br>“Yes. Something light. Flexible. Good leather.”<br><br>The shopkeeper produced one from behind the counter — a dark-braided riding crop with a large flap and a beautiful handle wrapped in oxhide.<br><br>She collected both purchases, paid in silver, and sat down on a nearby fitting bench. Then she replaced the old spurs on her boots with the new pair, tightening each strap precisely, spinning the sharp rowels with her fingers.<br><br>When she stood, she gave one short flick of her foot.<br><br>The spurs chimed.<br><br>Soft. Clean. Warning.<br><br>She stepped outside, feeling powerful and a bit turned on.<br><br>Winnie, still waiting where she had been left, looked up. Her eyes went to Jade’s feet first — and noticed the new rowels. Then to her hand — where the new whip looked like a question already answered.<br><br>Winnie gulped.<br><br>The sight of Jade in her new outfit and gear was a reminder.<br><br>Not of cruelty. But of authority.<br><br>Winnie lowered her gaze back to the street, and waited for Jade's next command.<br><br>She is my rider. She is my superior.<br><br>***<br><br>The room above the tavern was quiet as always by the end of the day.<br><br>Jade sat at the edge of the bed, calm and still as Winnie knelt before her. Wordlessly, as she did each night, Winnie helped her undress — gently peeling away her riding tunic, and finally removing the elegant boots that now bore her sharp new spurs.<br><br>Winnie held one foot in both hands, kissed the arch softly, then leaned down to begin licking away the day’s dust and sweat from her owner’s feet and legs. It was no longer just a ritual. It was reverence. It was peaceful.<br><br>Jade exhaled slowly, her hand resting lightly on Winnie’s head.<br><br>“You have been serving me so well,” she murmured, her tone quiet but rich with meaning. “And there is something I want to ask you.”<br><br>Winnie paused, her lips still close to Jade’s feet, then looked up with questioning eyes.<br><br>Jade continued gently. “I have been thinking about fitting you with breast rings—for proper stirrup attachment. The kind used by most goblin riders for better comfort and control.”<br><br>She ran her fingers slowly across Winnie’s naked breasts, as if imagining them. Then she caressed her ponygirl’s pretty face.<br><br>“And also… face rings. Cheek-to-mouth. To replace the bit.”<br><br>Winnie blinked.<br><br>“Those are less common among goblin mounts,” Jade said. “But it would make things easier for both of us: you would be able to speak when I allow it. And I wouldn’t need to remove and reinsert the bit every time we rest.”<br><br>She paused.<br><br>“I didn’t shop for those items today because… I won’t make that decision without you. These are permanent body modifications.”<br><br>Winnie lowered her eyes again, looking submissive but intimidated. “Can I think about it?”<br><br>Jade nodded. “Of course. But I will need your answer in the morning. If we do this, the piercings will need time to heal before we ride to Elmsworth.”<br><br>***<br><br>That night, after extinguishing the lamp, Jade climbed into bed and pulled the covers around them. She lay down on top of Winnie's naked body, as usual, her body sinking gently into the warmth and support of the girl who carried her by day and held her at night.<br><br>Winnie stared at the ceiling in the dark, awake for a long time.<br><br>The question turned in her chest like a quiet drumbeat.<br><br>If I say yes… I will never be a normal girl again.<br><br>The rings would mark her. Permanently. She would always be seen this way. Even if she was freed. She would always look like a ponygirl.<br><br>And what would Cassian think, if he ever saw her like that?<br><br>What would any man think of her?<br><br>She winced, then closed her eyes.<br><br>But even as those thoughts stung, another voice rose gently through them: You’re not his. You’re hers.<br><br>The idea of being marked for Jade — because of Jade — filled her chest with something steady and warm. A kind of stillness she never found when she was trying to be anything else but Jade’s slave.<br><br>And besides… She hated the bit.<br><br>The face rings would be better. More comfortable. More real.<br><br>She looked at Jade’s sleeping form resting peacefully across her.<br><br>And she made her decision.<br><br>Morning came slowly. Soft light pooled through the shutters. <br><br>Jade stirred first, rising slowly from bed, her hair a gentle mess of waves, her breath calm and even. <br><br>She took two slow steps, lifted her sleeping gown, and squatted lightly over the chamber pot to relieve herself.<br><br>Behind her, Winnie laid motionless on the mattress, watching.<br><br>Then, softly: “I am ready.”<br><br>Jade turned, blinking sleepily. “Mm?”<br><br>Winnie’s voice came steadier this time. “For the piercings. All of them. The breast rings. The face rings. I am ready to wear them… for you.”<br><br>Jade’s eyes widened, and for a long second she just squatted there, taking in the quiet certainty of those words. Her lips parted slightly as the flow of her urine slowed to a trickle, then ended.<br><br>She stood and stepped forward, slowly, deliberately — then she climbed onto the bed, straddling Winnie’s face with an urgency she had never experienced before.<br><br>Winnie didn’t have time to think. A drop of pee fell right onto her lips before Jade’s drenched pussy enveloped them. Winnie opened her mouth and licked, tasting a few more drops of Jade’s sour morning pee followed by the dense sweetness of her rapidly flowing juices.<br><br>She tried to move her lips and tongue in the most stimulating way, but this was very different from the oral service she had repeatedly given Jade during the last few days. <br><br>For starters, Jade was on top of her, pressing hard against Winnie’s mouth. And she was in a reverse position, fondling Winnie’s breasts with her hands as if enjoying for the last time how they felt without piercings.<br><br>Winnie realized that she was being ridden.<br><br>So she simply extended her tongue out as much as possible.<br><br>Jade felt it, and she responded. First she slid her entire pussy back and forth over it, several times. Then she bounced on it over and over again, letting Winnie’s tongue get deeper and deeper into her while Winnie’s nose was simultaneously pushed against her anus.<br><br>Jade kept alternating those two movements – sliding and bouncing on Winnie’s face – and she didn’t last long before reaching a screaming orgasm.<br><br>“Thanks for explaining so clearly how my decision made you feel,” Winnie said with a satisfied smile when Jade finally dismounted her face and looked down at her with a satisfied smile.<br><br>***<br><br>Shortly after breakfast, the streets of Irgrak were still cool and shaded as Jade rode Winnie toward the artisan quarter.<br><br>The shop they approached had no sign—just a curtain of hanging brass discs that jingled softly as they passed through. It was right next to the one where Jade had purchased her new spurs, with a communicating door.<br><br>Inside, the air was warm and clean, tinged with lavender oil and polished steel. The room was lit by wide skylights, with a padded bench in the center and trays of gleaming tools laid out like instruments in a ritual.<br><br>A female goblin sat cross-legged at a worktable, sharpening a large curved needle against a smooth whetstone. She looked up, her face lined with experience, her demeanor calm.<br><br>“You must be the human girlrider,” she said.<br><br>“I am,” Jade replied.<br><br>“And that out there is your mount?”<br><br>“She is,” Jade said proudly.<br><br>“Please take her to the back. I will meet you there,” the goblin woman said efficiently.<br><br>The process was deliberate, meticulous.<br><br>First came the breast rings.<br><br>Winnie sat upright on a bench, her back straight, arms still bound by the saddle cuffs. The goblin wiped the skin clean, then she marked precise points on the sides of Winnie’s fairly wide areola.<br><br>How deep are these rings going to go? Winnie wondered with a chill.<br><br>Deep enough to sustain the weight of my rider’s legs and feet. She gave herself the obvious answer.<br><br>Jade stood nearby, hands clasped behind her back, watching closely. She flinched as the goblin smoothly broke into Winnie’s skin with the large curved needle.<br><br>Winnie tried to be strong, but she soon started moaning, sobbing, and then crying out loud. <br><br>It felt like forever before the needle emerged on the other side of her areola, exactly at the point the skilled goblin had marked. The pain was extreme, and it only decreased slightly when the needle completed its journey.<br><br>I am suffering so that Jade can forever use my breasts to hold her feet in the most comfort… and in the perfect position to dig her spurs into my abdomen, giving me more pain all day long…<br><br>Winnie could not believe what she had become. <br><br>And yet, even while feeling the most intense pain of her young life, she could no longer get herself to feel any resentment. She braced herself as the goblin woman started cleaning and marking the skin of her second breast, trembling in fear. But she looked into Jade’s satisfied eyes, and her resolve did not waver.<br><br>Jade stepped forward, placing a hand gently on Winnie's shoulder while her second breast was deeply pierced. “You are doing beautifully,” she said softly.<br><br>The cheek-to-mouth rings came next.<br><br>Winnie turned her head as instructed. The artisan cleaned her skin and marked the points: just one per cheek, below the cheekbone. The other side of each ring would pass through Winnie’s mouth, right at its corners.<br><br>When the first needle passed through the flesh of her left cheek, Winnie braced herself. But it was over quickly, and not too painfully. When the second followed on the right cheek, she barely flinched. <br><br>Winnie breathed through her nose, steady.<br><br>The artisan fitted the rings: clean, polished, functional. When her job was complete, she stepped back and wiped her tools.<br><br>“It’s done.”<br><br>Winnie remained still.<br><br>The breast rings gleamed in the filtered sunlight, looking strong and permanent. The new facial rings were more subtle but elegant — framing her mouth with quiet dignity, yet strong enough for reins to be clipped… and then pulled.<br><br>The goblin woman stuck two fingers into Winnie’s mouth to open it without compliments, so she could show Jade how the face rings could easily be removed at any time.<br><br>“The breast rings are different, of course,” she clarified. “Once your mount’s flesh heals around them, they will become impossible to remove without seriously damaging the ponygirl.”<br><br>Winnie swallowed hard.<br><br>Her self-image used to center around strength, independence, and physical prowess. Now, redirected, it found its expression in her capacity to serve Jade tirelessly. The piercings symbolized her discipline, determination, and devotion. They were badges of honor and symbols of excellence in her new identity, she decided.<br><br>Jade circled Winnie slowly, taking in every detail. With pride.<br><br>“She looks…” Jade began, then paused.<br><br>The artisan finished the thought. “Owned.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “And loved.”<br><br>She paid without negotiation. <br><br>That’s when Winnie realized something: Jade had not explained to the goblin woman what piercings she wanted. She had not asked for the price. The job must have been agreed and scheduled on the previous day.<br><br>Jade must have booked it during her shopping trip on the previous day, assuming that Winnie would accept her request.<br><br>This should have made Winnie furious. How presumptuous! Instead, she felt nothing but submission and admiration: her owner knew her so well.<br><br>As Jade finished inspecting the fresh piercings with quiet satisfaction, the artisan left briefly and then returned from her workbench with a small engraving tool in hand.<br><br>“There’s something more I can offer,” she said, gesturing lightly to the rings on Winnie’s chest. “We sometimes inscribe the owner’s name on the hardware. Discreet. But unmistakable.”<br><br>Jade’s eyes lit up.<br><br>“I want that,” she said immediately.<br><br>The goblin woman nodded. “It will only take a few minutes.”<br><br>The engraving was simple: JADE.<br><br>Four letters.<br><br>Precise.<br><br>Permanent.<br><br>And irremovable.<br><br>“They mean you are mine. Forever.”<br><br>Winnie blinked slowly.<br><br>Her breath caught in her throat for just a second. She didn’t speak. She didn’t nod. She absorbed it.<br><br>Something inside her flinched—an echo of the life she used to have, the dreams she once imagined for herself. My breasts will never again look desirable to a man. They now exist only for the comfort of Jade’s feet.<br><br>Then… quiet.<br><br>And in that quiet: warmth. By accepting those body modifications, Winnie had completely released herself from any remaining internal conflict, clarifying her subservient role, solidifying the emotional security she gained from Jade’s dominance.<br><br>She permanently bore Jade’s name on her breasts.<br><br>She smiled.<br><br>***<br><br>The expedition was ready.<br><br>Jade stood by her mount, one hand resting gently on the curve of the saddle that now fit perfectly on Winnie’s back. Her uniform—a dark blue goblin-made tunic—fit cleanly. Her boots gleamed. And the new spurs caught the light with a soft gleam.<br><br>Winnie, kneeling for now, looked as polished and prepared as her rider. Her chest harness was snug, the breast rings already healed thanks to the balm the piercing artisan had insisted Jade apply twice daily. The stirrup leathers were clipped directly to those rings for the first time.<br><br>At her cheeks, the silver rings were small but not less impressive. From them, the reins hung loosely. They were soft, looped, and functional—permitting Jade to direct with gentle tugs without necessarily silencing her mount.<br><br>Jade ran a hand through Winnie’s hair once. She had decided that Winnie would be allowed to speak briefly when asked a question, another way in which she sought to differentiate her domination style from the goblin ways.<br><br>“You ready?”<br><br>Winnie looked up, calm and clear-eyed. “Yes, Mistress.”<br><br>Jade nodded once. Then turned as the others approached.<br><br>Tarak was the first to arrive.<br><br>He rode a tall, lithe human woman with dusky skin and long black hair braided into a tight cord. Her back was arched, posture perfect, mouth firmly gagged with a bridle-bit while reins passed from her lips to Tarak’s steady hand. She wore a dark harness reinforced with brass, and large breast rings to sustain the stirrups. Her arms were bound at the elbows behind her to support the wide saddle atop her back.<br><br>Tarak himself wore practical riding gear—deep green tunic, long gloves, and a long, curved knife strapped across his chest. He gave Jade a quick, toothy grin.<br><br>“Didn’t think you’d look this ready. Your new tack seems top-notch.”<br><br>“I am,” Jade replied smoothly. “And it is. Only the best for my loyal mount.”<br><br>Next came Sena, tall and matronly by goblin standards, wearing a comfortable tunic and gold hoop earrings that glinted beneath her headscarf. She rode a stout, powerful ponygirl with visible muscle and short-cropped auburn hair. Sena’s reins were clipped to cheek rings, similar to Winnie’s, though her saddle was bulkier and less upright—designed for maximum comfort over long distances.<br><br>Sena’s saddlebags were packed with rolled scrolls, maps, and inked parchments. She was the planner, and the official leader of the small group. The look in her eyes was focused and sharp.<br><br>Finally, Malgrin approached—older, more reserved, with salt-gray hair and a heavy brow. He rode smoothly, his mount obedient and well-trained: a thin but wiry woman, her skin pale and freckled, her limbs long and calloused. She bore visible whip scars across her rump, faded but deep. Malgrin said little, but his eyes missed nothing. And his mount carried the most gear of all.<br><br>Together, the four riders and their mounts formed a square in the clearing—silent but strong.<br><br>Tarak leaned forward in his saddle.<br><br>“Ready?”<br><br>Jade gave a nod.<br><br>She mounted and ordered Winnie up.<br><br>Sena checked the direction of the sun.<br><br>And together… three goblins, one human rider… four mounted slaves… they passed through the gate and into the woods beyond.<br><br>For Jade, everything felt… perfect.<br><br>The new saddle supported her hips and spine — broader and deeper than the goblin-sized one she had used before, its center of gravity aligned exactly with her posture. Her legs hung with natural ease, her heels aligned, her weight evenly distributed. <br><br>The stirrups, now clipped to Winnie’s freshly healed breast rings, allowed her feet to settle into a new position — just a little farther forward, but it made all the difference.<br><br>She felt comfortable and powerful, sitting in total command, her seat firm, her legs secure, her mount completely attuned to her every whim.<br><br>She gave the reins a gentle flick to the right — and was rewarded with an immediate response. <br><br>Winnie turned exactly as much as Jade wanted. No hesitation. No stiffness from the bit. Just smooth, subtle movement — her head guided as if Jade’s hands had reached directly into the corner of her mouth.<br><br>Jade smiled.<br><br>The face rings were already proving superior.<br><br>She leaned back slightly, just enough to feel the stability of the new saddle, and she let her boots rest heavier in the stirrups. She didn’t press the spurs yet, but even the shift in her feet — the way the steel rowels tilted and glinted — sent a faint shiver of tension down into the girl beneath her.<br><br>For Winnie, the ride was unlike any she’d ever experienced.<br><br>The trail itself wasn’t hard — the terrain soft, the sun warm, the company silent and steady — but the equipment made everything feel new.<br><br>The saddle was heavier, yes. But it was also stable. It didn’t shift or grind. It fit. Jade’s weight, more evenly spread now, didn’t press on one point or another. It simply rested across her whole back, like an ever-present reminder of her role.<br><br>The breast rings changed everything.<br><br>The weight of Jade’s legs and feet, comfortable in the stirrups, produced a constant downward pull at the rings on her breasts. And every movement of Jade’s legs and feet — every bounce, shift, or sway — tugged further into her sensitive flesh.<br><br>Enough to constantly remind her that those feet, protected by new polished boots and armed with sharp spurs, were resting comfortably because her body bore them.<br><br>It was degrading.<br><br>But also grounding. She had never felt more like a mount.<br><br>And it was almost… intimate.<br><br>A silent conversation carried through leather and metal.<br><br>When the first real command came — a sharp and assertive dig of the spurs into Winnie’s abdomen, it was no surprise: somehow, the rings had warned her. She had felt the decision through her breasts before the spurs landed.<br><br>The sharp sting startled her anyway, but she didn’t falter. She obediently quickened her pace.<br><br>Her rider — her beautiful, brilliant, demanding rider — was comfortable and in command because she was strong and devoted enough to carry her that way.<br><br>As long as Jade sat high and proud above her, Winnie knew exactly who she was.<br><br>The path through the trees widened, winding gently alongside a low river. The air was cool, the canopy overhead soft with filtered light. The boots of the four ponygirls beat a steady rhythm into the earth as they climbed the gentle incline of the trail beneath their riders.<br><br>Sena pulled her mount slightly closer to Jade’s side, the reins in one hand, her posture relaxed but curious.<br><br>“I’ve been wondering,” she began, her voice calm and sharp, “about how humans do it.”<br><br>Jade turned her head slightly, keeping her reins balanced between her fingers. “Do what?”<br><br>“Mount training,” Sena said. “Breaking. Conditioning. Pair bonding. We have dozens of methods, depending on temperament. But you… you seem to have achieved a deep level of submission, perhaps unlike any I have ever seen. Your mount is not only responsive, well-mannered, obedient… but she also seems to love serving you.”<br><br>Jade smiled with just the right amount of mystery.<br><br>“She just responded to the right attitude,” she said.<br><br>Sena cocked her head. “Are your riders mostly women?”<br><br>Jade didn’t hesitate. “Almost entirely. The structure works best when it's female-led.”<br><br>“And the ponies?”<br><br>Jade glanced down at Winnie, who walked steadily beneath her, eyes forward, face calm beneath the reins clipped to her cheek rings.<br><br>“A mix,” she said, thinking fast about what to say. “Both male and female. I prefer ponygirls – and I get why goblins use them exclusively – but human riders are heavier than goblins, so only the most petite like me can ride a girl all day long. Besides… submission isn’t about gender. It’s about devotion.”<br><br>Sena raised her eyebrows. “Interesting. And yes, we don’t trust human males. Too volatile. Too proud.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “We find that the mounts who struggle most with pride are often the most rewarding to train. Winnie was exactly like that.”<br><br>That made Sena smile. “Spoken like someone who’s won.”<br><br>Jade flashed a proud smile. “We both won. Winnie and I were made for each other.”<br><br>They rode a few more steps in silence before Sena added, “How are they trained, then? Is there a system?”<br><br>Jade inhaled slowly, her mind racing — improvising.<br><br>“There are several schools,” she said. “And I’m hoping you’ll see one for yourself.”<br><br>“Oh?”<br><br>“There’s an academy called Elmsworth right in the region we’re heading into,” she continued. “It’s a school for young women — one of the first places where the riding tradition began forming in an organized way. A few of their students already have trained mounts. Others are eager to learn. It might be the best place to demonstrate our methods to your delegation.”<br><br>Winnie said nothing, of course. But beneath her, Jade felt her body tense just slightly — not from disagreement, but from understanding.<br><br>You’re using Beth’s school.<br><br>You’re making it real.<br><br>Sena nodded thoughtfully. “And they’ll welcome us?”<br><br>Jade met her gaze. “I believe so, as long as we present ourselves as peers, not conquerors.”<br><br>Sena considered that for a long moment. Then she smiled faintly. “Very well.”<br><br>Jade tightened her left rein slightly to get closer to Sena, enough that Winnie’s upper arm bumped softly against Sena’s ponygirl. Then she placed a finger on Sena’s map, marking the location of Elmsworth Academy.<br><br>***<br><br>The sun had climbed past its zenith by the time the path leveled into a clearing beside a slow-moving stream. A canopy of trees offered dappled shade, and the breeze carried the scent of moss and dry bark.<br><br>Tarak raised a hand, signaling a halt.<br><br>The riders dismounted one by one.<br><br>Winnie sank gratefully to her knees on command, and Jade slid smoothly from the saddle, landing with practiced ease. She unbuckled the ponygirl’s arms and loosened her saddlebag straps while Sena and Malgrin did the same.<br><br>Each of the goblin riders casually guided their mounts into position as their human girls knelt, then settled into all-fours near flat stones or low stumps.<br><br>Without ceremony, the goblins sat upon them — like benches.<br><br>But Jade?<br><br>Jade turned to Winnie and gave her a snap of her fingers, followed by a gentle roll of her index finger. <br><br>Winnie knew what it meant and she presented herself not just as a seat, but as a lounge – laying on her back, with her knees bent and her feet planted on the ground.<br><br>Jade sat on her stomach and found her thighs ready. She leaned back, sighing in satisfaction.<br><br>Then—slowly, with no command spoken—Winnie removed Jade’s new boots, placed her feet onto her own face, and began to kiss them.<br><br>She sucked her toes, freshening them up after the hours spent in the leather boots. <br><br>One by one.<br><br>Softly at first, then with slow, lingering reverence. She also pressed her lips and slid her tongue across the arches and heels she knew by heart. Reverently.<br><br>The goblins watched in curious silence.<br><br>Tarak raised an eyebrow. “Does she always…?”<br><br>“She does,” Jade replied calmly, not even glancing down. “Because she wants to.”<br><br>Sena frowned. “She loves being dominated?”<br><br>“She loves me,” Jade said. “Her submission is how that love is expressed.”<br><br>Malgrin scoffed. “Too much emotion in a mount is a weakness. Ours are meant to serve. Not feel.”<br><br>Jade looked over, finally, meeting his gaze.<br><br>“A ponygirl who obeys out of fear can be broken and used. But a ponygirl who obeys out of love… will carry you through fire.”<br><br>Sena tilted her head. “So she submits not just because you command her…”<br><br>“But because she adores me,” Jade completed her sentence.<br><br>The break ended after an hour of rest and quiet conversation. Saddles were tightened, stirrups clipped, reins gathered.<br><br>Jade mounted once more, settling comfortably onto the leather as Winnie rose beneath her.<br><br>They continued eastward.<br><br>It wasn’t long before the forest path narrowed into a steep incline. Roots jutted from the ground like ribs, and the slope curved sharply upward between tall trees.<br><br>The mounts began to grunt in strain.<br><br>Jade leaned forward in her saddle, gathering the reins in one hand.<br><br>The rowels of her new spurs made their first assertive contact.<br><br>Winnie gasped — not from surprise, but from impact.<br><br>The new spurs were no decoration. The rowels bit sharply into the tender flesh below.<br><br>Not hard enough to draw blood. But they hurt much more than the old ones, and Jade used them with the same force.<br><br>Winnie climbed, with effort and obedience.<br><br>Another dig.<br><br>Winnie flinched. But she obeyed and increased her pace.<br><br>She gritted her teeth, breath heavy, legs shaking as she walked up the slope with her rider centered above her.<br><br>She could feel every ounce of her load on the steep incline. The weight of the saddlebags added to that of Jade’s comfortable body. <br><br>Winnie’s legs burned. She could look down and see the muscles of her own thighs flex with every step, right below Jade’s boots swinging effortlessly in the stirrups.<br><br>And that beautifully unfair contrast gave her motivation.<br><br>Because every sting of the spurs was Jade’s feet.<br><br>And every tug of the reins was Jade’s hands.`],
      6: ["Chapter 6", `The second morning on the trail began in stillness and light fog, the trees whispering with the occasional gust of wind. The four riders rose early, ate a modest breakfast of dried bread and smoked meat, then mounted their girls and set out once more.<br><br>For a while, it was peaceful.<br><br>Jade sat with quiet command in her saddle. She had long stopped thinking consciously about reins, spurs, or position — it was all instinct now. Beneath her, Winnie moved smoothly over the soft forest floor, her newly healed rings no longer tender, her breasts getting used to the constant weight of Jade's legs and feet pulling them down.<br><br>Just over an hour in, Jade noticed something.<br><br>A scent.<br><br>Not strong. But unmistakable.<br><br>Smoke.<br><br>She glanced over at Tarak, who had already turned his head toward the headwind. That’s when a new rider appeared on the trail, flustered, facing them: a wiry goblin with travel-dust on his cloak and a weathered look in his eyes. He was mounted on a lean, muscular ponygirl, her skin streaked with ash and her lips cracked from wind and dryness.<br><br>He raised a hand in greeting.<br><br>Tarak rode ahead and exchanged words quickly in the goblin tongue. Jade couldn’t catch every word — the language was fast and clipped — but she understood enough: fire, north ridge, spreading.<br><br>The stranger turned and pointed toward the hills on the horizon.<br><br>The way they had planned to go.<br><br>Tarak grimaced. “There’s a fire up ahead. Too large to go around.”<br><br>Sena pulled out a leather-bound scroll, placing the map over the head of her ponygirl.<br><br>Jade approached her, reins pulling Winnie’s cheek rings to make her move sideways.<br><br>“This one’s the trail I was planning to take,” Sena muttered, running her finger along the northern pass. “But now we can’t risk the pine slopes. If the fire is moving with the wind, we’ll be trapped.”<br><br>“Is there another way?” Jade asked.<br><br>“There is,” Sena replied. “But it’s not a kind one.”<br><br>She tapped a blank patch to the east.<br><br>“The old lakebed. Salt flat. Nothing but hardened dust and scorched brine for miles. No shade. No water.”<br><br>“How long to cross?”<br><br>Sena frowned, doing quick calculations in her head. “If we keep pace… we’ll reach the other side by nightfall.”<br><br>Malgrin grunted. “If our mounts hold out.”<br><br>Jade glanced down at Winnie, who looked calm beneath her, but already dusted with fatigue from the previous climb.<br><br>She looked back at Sena.<br><br>“I think we can do it.”<br><br>Tarak nodded grimly. “Then let’s move.”<br><br>The trees gave way to the open sky when the riders found themselves standing at the edge of something vast and intimidating: the dried salt lake.<br><br>White and cracked, the earth stretched in every direction, shimmering faintly in the light. Here and there, salt deposits gleamed like shards of glass. The wind blew harder out here, sharp and dry, carrying the promise of thirst.<br><br>The metal rings on Winnie’s chest and face gleamed under the sun. The leather of the saddle started getting warmer.<br><br>Winnie steadied herself.<br><br>She knew this was going to be a test of endurance, stretched thin over salt and heat.<br><br>And as Jade dug her new sharp spurs into her sides, she moved forward obediently.<br><br>The sun bore down like judgment.<br><br>The white of the dried lakebed reflected its fury in every direction, turning the flat world into a blinding sea of glare and heat. Even the sky, clear and cloudless, felt oppressive — too wide, too indifferent.<br><br>Salt crunched under the boots of the ponygirls.<br><br>The four riders and their mounts moved in formation: Tarak at the front, ever watchful; Sena and Jade side by side in the center; and Malgrin at the rear, his sharp eyes sweeping the horizon.<br><br>Sena held the map rolled in one hand, reins in the other, her posture unshakable atop her panting mount. Her ponygirl walked with practiced control, her back glistening with sweat already.<br><br>Jade adjusted her seat slightly, shifting her weight to distribute it more evenly. Beneath her, Winnie moved steadily, silently, the rings on her chest and face catching occasional flecks of reflected light. Her breathing had deepened, her tongue already dry.<br><br>That’s when Sena spoke.<br><br>Her voice was clear, commanding, matter-of-fact.<br><br>“We are now in water conservation mode,” she announced. “The stretch is too long.”<br><br>She unhooked the water flask from her saddle and took a sip. “Each rider may drink as needed — small sips, rationed. No water for the mounts.”<br><br>Jade blinked. Had she heard that correctly?<br><br>She looked down at Winnie — moving beneath her in silent obedience, body already starting to strain.<br><br>Then back at Sena.<br><br>“No water for the mounts?” Jade asked, trying to keep her voice level.<br><br>Sena didn’t look at her. “Correct.”<br><br>Jade’s brow furrowed. “But they are doing all the labor, carrying our weight and supplies. That’s—” she caught herself. “That’s not sustainable.”<br><br>“They will drink,” she said, her gaze fixed on the horizon. “Just not from a flask.”<br><br>Jade turned toward her.<br><br>Sena explained, “It’s an old practice. Goblin riders have long used their own bodies to hydrate mounts when water is scarce. Our urine contains enough water and minerals to keep them moving when nothing else is available.”<br><br>Jade blinked, absorbing the new information.<br><br>Sena continued, her tone calm, as if reciting a lesson. “In the past, it was more common and it assumed a ceremonial value. A rider sustaining their mount on nothing but their bond. Today, it’s seen more as a practical method when necessary.”<br><br>Jade looked down at Winnie.<br><br>Her mount hadn’t reacted outwardly. She was still walking at the brisk pace demanded by her rider—measured, strong, quiet. But Jade felt tension in Winnie's back, a slight hitch in her gait when Sena explained what was waiting for her all day long.<br><br>Sena cast Jade a sideways glance. “You’re surprised.”<br><br>Jade hesitated. “A little. It’s not… a custom I was aware of. But I understand the logic.”<br><br>“You have the most personal relationship I have ever seen between a rider and her mount, so I am sure you will do well with this practice” Sena said. “It’s meant to connect. The rider gives from above, and the mount receives. They survive together.”<br><br>Jade gave a slow nod.<br><br>She looked again at Winnie, who kept her eyes fixed forward, but her lips parted slightly now. Her mouth was dry. Her face was flushed with heat.<br><br>Jade gently laid a hand on top of her head, not to command—just to reassure. This… was going to be just another form of unity and trust.<br><br>The group pressed forward across the salt-bleached plain, the heat rising off the surface in pale waves, as though the earth itself was exhaling. The silence of the land was total — no birds, no breeze, no shelter. Just sun and salt and endurance.<br><br>After a couple of hours on the open lakebed, the strength of the mounts was flagging. Shoulders slumped. Gaits grew uneven.<br><br>Sena raised a hand. “Let’s stop here, just for a few minutes,” she said, and everyone obeyed without question.<br><br>The group gathered by the jagged outcrop of a stone that jutted up from the salt. It offered no shade, but at least a sense of direction. The goblins dismounted one by one, their boots crunching on the dry crust.<br><br>Jade dismounted last. Winnie, glistening with sweat and dust, bowed her head slightly, catching her breath while staying down on her knees. Her lips were dry, her throat aching. She said nothing.<br><br>Jade rested a hand on her shoulder while observing her travel companions.<br><br>The two males had it easier: they simply made their kneeling ponygirls bend forward, took off their bits, and relieved themselves into their mouths while standing up.<br><br>Sena, on the other hand, removed her ponygirl’s saddle and freed her arms before ordering her down on her back. Then she knelt on the girl’s chest – right above her breasts – and lowered her crotch onto her face while lifting her tunic.<br><br>There was no drama. No indulgence. Only the kind of necessity that survival demanded in places where nature offered nothing.<br><br>Jade listened to Sena’s ponygirl’s loud gulps.<br><br>She had followed the goblin woman’s example and unsaddled Winnie. But now she hesitated.<br><br>Winnie looked at her, eyes soft. She did not wait for Jade’s command. She laid down on her back, looked up at Jade, and opened her mouth in a clear invitation.<br><br>It almost looked as if she was begging for it.<br><br>Jade’s heart skipped a beat, and she felt an unmistakable warmth in her loins.<br><br>She took a deep breath, stepped forward, and squatted over Winnie’s face.<br><br>Jade maintained eye contact with Winnie as she relaxed her bladder and began pissing into her mouth. She tried to slow down her flow, so Winnie could keep up and swallow at regular intervals before her mouth filled up.<br><br>Winnie created a seal with her lips around Jade’s vulva, determined to catch every drop of the liquid on which her own very survival could well depend. Then she just swallowed… and swallowed… and swallowed.<br><br>It didn’t taste good. But it came from the body of the girl she had learned to worship.<br><br>It was the most degrading and erotic few minutes that Jade and Winnie had ever experienced.<br><br>They never broke eye contact, and Jade smiled with a sense of power and accomplishment when her flow finally started slowing.<br><br>She felt so proud of Winnie. And so aroused that she couldn’t help but moan in front of her travel companions when Winnie dutifully licked her clean at the end.<br><br>Sena chuckled. “I knew you would like it…”<br><br>Then she re-mounted her ponygirl, getting back to business and calling an end to the short break, “Brisker pace for the next hour. We need to reach the far ridge before sunset.”<br><br>The group mounted again. Leather creaked. Salt cracked under boots and bare feet.<br><br>Jade swung into the saddle, reins in one hand.<br><br>Then came the spurs — not cruelly, but decisively. Jade dug them in just enough to say now and harder.<br><br>Winnie obeyed immediately.<br><br>Her legs burned, her lungs ached — but she moved with purpose.<br><br>And the sour taste in her mouth was a reminder.<br><br>She belonged to Jade.<br><br>***<br><br>For the riders, time blurred.<br><br>For the mounts, it felt endless.<br><br>The ponygirls staggered. Their gaits slowed from fast walk to labored trudge. Shoulders sagged, and dust streaked their faces, mixing with sweat and salt. Their arms remained bound behind their backs glistening with sweat, heads forward, chins trembling.<br><br>They were beyond speech. Beyond thought.<br><br>Just motion.<br><br>Sena rode with unflinching resolve. Her spurs struck rhythmically, mercilessly. One jab for every lagging step. Two more if her mount slowed again.<br><br>Tarak, less patient, had already resorted to whipping. A firm, efficient strike to the thigh or flank, every few dozen paces. Malgrin’s strokes were harsher — sharp, with less restraint. He was old-fashioned.<br><br>And Jade?<br><br>Jade watched it all.<br><br>Then did what she had to.<br><br>She dug her spurs hard and often into Winnie’s abdomen, seemingly without any trace of guilt, making sure she kept up with the others despite being the only ponygirl bearing the heavier burden of a human rider.<br><br>Winnie’s body flinched at each sting, but her legs kept moving, thighs burning, heels scraping the salt.<br><br>And the whip came, too.<br><br>Hard enough to tell every fiber of Winnie’s exhausted body that she had no choice but to obey.<br><br>Winnie gasped with each lash — but never cried out.<br><br>Because crying out took energy.<br><br>And she needed every last scrap to carry Jade.<br><br>Inside Winnie’s mind, the world had narrowed to pain, weight, and heat. Every breath scorched her throat. Every drop of sweat felt like a loss.<br><br>But even in that haze… she felt her rider. Every time Jade reached for the flask — and took a sip — Winnie heard the soft slosh of water. It made her crave it.<br><br>But there was no trace of resentment.<br><br>Because Jade was the rider.<br><br>The owner.<br><br>Jade gave Winnie everything — weight, pain, commands, guidance. And yes… even hydration.<br><br>The act that had startled her earlier now felt natural. A system. A bond. Winnie simply couldn’t wait for the sloshing water to make its way through Jade’s superior body so that she could drink some of it… enhanced.<br><br>Jade could simply do no wrong in Winnie's mind.<br><br>Even the stings of the spurs — sharp, urgent, deliberate — reminded Winnie that she was seen.<br><br>Useful. Owned.<br><br>***<br><br>On the third hydration break of the day, Jade decided to try something new. Instead of following Sena’s system – which took some time because it involved removing the saddle from her ponygirl’s back – she ordered Winnie on her knees and remained in the saddle.<br><br>She placed a hand on Winnie’s head, gently but firmly forcing it backwards until the confused but obedient ponygirl was looking up toward the sky. <br><br>Then she stood up in the stirrups. Winnie groaned in pain, as Jade’s full weight pulled down on her breast rings, but it only lasted a second: Jade promptly sat on Winnie’s face, hiding most of it between her soft milky thighs.<br><br>She felt Winnie’s understanding as the girl beneath her placed her lips into position around her owner’s vulva. Jade relaxed her bladder. Focused on maintaining her balance in this new position, distributing her weight somewhat evenly between Winnie’s face and the stirrups connected to her breasts, Jade forgot to control the speed of her flow.<br><br>She couldn’t make eye contact with Winnie in this reverse straddle position, so she didn’t realize how fast Winnie had to swallow until the end, when her flow started slowing anyway.<br><br>Winnie struggled, but she didn’t miss a drop.<br><br>“Good girl,” Jade whispered, before making her moan in pain again as she quickly stood into the stirrups to hop back onto her saddle.<br><br>Sena looked impressed, but her shorter goblin legs did not allow her to imitate Jade’s technique.<br><br>***<br><br>They had two more hydration breaks before the heat finally relented, as the sky began to turn gold and lavender. <br><br>The air cooled slightly, but the ground still radiated heat like an oven — and every breath felt like it scraped Winnie’s throat, which had swallowed nothing but Jade’s increasingly strong piss for the entire day.<br><br>Lifted further up from the ground, the riders felt the cooling air and decided that they could push their ponygirls to a faster pace during those final hours. <br><br>They needed to reach the safety of the tree cover before nightfall.<br><br>“We pick up the pace,” Sena called, her voice cutting through the silence.<br><br>No debate.<br><br>No pause.<br><br>The riders nodded and moved as one.<br><br>Just like the others, Jade dug both spurs in deep, and Winnie let out a soft, guttural sound — not protest, but effort.<br><br>Then came the whip.<br><br>Not as controlled as before. Now it was urgent.<br><br>It slashed across Winnie’s thigh, then again across the soft curve of her rear. Winnie flinched and gave a sharp cry — the sound ripping from her throat like steam.<br><br>Jade did not relent, determined to keep up with her travel companions, and kept giving Winnie the pain that she needed.<br><br>Tears sprang to Winnie’s eyes, but not from weakness. From the rawness of giving everything. She was almost thankful for Jade’s painful commands, because they had a way of summoning those extra energies she desperately needed.<br><br>Winnie also kept repeating one mantra after another in her mind. <br><br>I exist to carry her.<br><br>Jade’s feet don’t walk.<br><br>***<br><br>When the salt finally ended, it felt like a finish line.<br><br>But then they saw it: a small hill, dark against the dusk sky, rising just before the trees. A cruel final obstacle.<br><br>Sena didn’t even pause.<br><br>The ponygirls climbed, any indecision erased by a symphony of loud whiplashes.<br><br>Each step up the hill was like lifting a mountain.<br><br>But Jade kept the painful commands coming. And Winnie made it.<br><br>At the top, the air was cooler. The group descended slowly, the spurs and whips finally resting. They found a clearing and a small river. At the water’s edge, the riders dismounted.<br><br>And the ponygirls collapsed in relief.<br><br>Jade helped Winnie to her hands and knees and guided her gently to the riverbank. Without needing to be told, Winnie bent forward, cupping the water and drinking deep, the coolness shocking, cleansing.<br><br>Jade knelt beside her, running a hand down her back.<br><br>“You did it,” she whispered.<br><br>Winnie said nothing.<br><br>But her head rested against Jade’s thigh.<br><br>And her whole body trembled, exhausted and proud.<br><br>That night, camp was set with slow, exhausted hands.<br><br>Saddles removed. Fire lit. Blankets unfurled.<br><br>And beneath the stars — at last — came rest.<br><br>***<br><br>Night fell soft and slow across the shallow valley, cooling the air that had blistered their skin all day. The sky above the camp shimmered with stars while the river hummed nearby — steady, cold, and life-giving.<br><br>Winnie eased herself onto the grass with aching grace. Her limbs still burned. Her skin was tender with small cuts from Jade’s spurs and deep welts from her whip. But Winnie’s gaze was calm.<br><br>She needed this part.<br><br>Jade stepped forward and lowered herself gently onto Winnie’s abdomen, adjusting until her weight was fully settled and her posture relaxed. She drew her knees up, then leaned back, crossing her arms behind her head — using Winnie’s bent thighs as a backrest.<br><br>Finally, with practiced ease, she stretched both legs forward and rested her bare feet squarely on Winnie’s face.<br><br>Not hard.<br><br>Not unkindly.<br><br>But deliberately. With a clear sense of ownership.<br><br>Winnie exhaled as the soles of Jade’s feet pressed against her cheeks, her lips, her brow. The scent of the day still lingered — leather, salt, dust, and sweat. But to her, they were clean. Beautiful. Sacred.<br><br>This was what grounded her.<br><br>This was why she had carried her so far. So hard.<br><br>To spare those feet from any pain and effort.<br><br>To give her adored rider comfort — at the cost of her own exhaustion.<br><br>And with her face hidden beneath them, Winnie felt safe.<br><br>Powerful, yet submissive.<br><br>Centered.<br><br>Those feet had used Winnie’s strength to make it through the lakebed, comfortably supported by stirrups attached to her deeply pierced breasts. They had constantly motivated her, digging the spurs countless times into the sides of Winnie’s abdomen, giving her painful commands with a sense of entitlement that made her feel completely subservient and owned. And now Winnie finally got to worship them, gratefully.<br><br>Jade said nothing for several minutes.<br><br>She simply sat and relaxed, while Winnie thoroughly cleaned her small feet with a passion that bordered on obsession, licking them, sucking each toe, taking them as deeply as she could into her servile mouth.<br><br>Then, when the ritual had settled in both of them, Jade turned.<br><br>She pivoted on Winnie's abdomen, swinging her legs behind her to straddle Winnie with her knees planted on either side of her hips.<br><br>“I’m going to help you now,” she said softly.<br><br>Winnie’s eyes, half-lidded in exhaustion, blinked slowly. Then nodded.<br><br>Jade reached down and began to knead Winnie’s thighs — slow, deep strokes that started at the knee and worked upward. Her hands were firm but careful. She worked the strained muscles, releasing the tension from the endless hours they had spent straining to carry her. Then she moved to the calves, repeating the process. She even massaged Winnie’s ankles and feet.<br><br>The goblins around the fire watched.<br><br>Tarak furrowed his brow.<br><br>Sena tilted her head slightly. “What are you doing?”<br><br>Jade didn’t stop. “Maintenance.” She moved to the other leg, continuing the massage. “Beasts of burden must be properly cared for. Especially after this kind of ride.”<br><br>Malgrin made a low, skeptical noise. But Sena kept watching.<br><br>Finally, she spoke again. “Perhaps… goblins could learn a thing or two from human riders after all.”<br><br>Jade didn’t look up.<br><br>She just smiled.<br><br>And kept working.<br><br>Later, when all was quiet, the riders laid draped across their mounts using them as living beds.<br><br>Jade lay across Winnie as she had on many nights before, arms wrapped gently around her waist, face resting on her breasts. Her breathing slowed. Steadied.<br><br>Winnie didn’t move.<br><br>She had carried Jade through the salt. She had obeyed every command. She had cried, endured, and suffered.<br><br>But now she was still.<br><br>And within that stillness, beneath the full weight of Jade’s body, she felt fulfilled like never before.<br><br>***<br><br>Dawn came quietly.<br><br>The sky warmed and a faint mist curled along the edge of the riverbank. Birds called distantly from the trees beyond the ridge, and the camp stirred gently to life — with slow hands, tired limbs, and groggy silence.<br><br>Sena knelt over her map near the fire’s remains, scanning the terrain by the soft light.<br><br>“We’re five hours out,” she said, her voice low but steady. “Brisk pace should get us to the school of Elmsworth by lunch.”<br><br>Tarak nodded. “Then we should move now.”<br><br>But Jade, sitting cross-legged on top of a still-sleeping Winnie, looked toward the river and said calmly, “Or we take a couple of hours to recover from yesterday’s long ride. Wash. Rest. And arrive fresh.”<br><br>Sena looked up at her, considering.<br><br>Then nodded. “Fair.”<br><br>Tarak and Malgrin exchanged a look — mildly disapproving, but neither argued. The lakebed had taken its toll on all of them.<br><br>Jade was the first to rise.<br><br>She stood without hesitation, peeling off her tunic and underclothes in the golden morning light. <br><br>Her bare body, pale and petite, looked pretty and spotless.<br><br>She turned to Winnie, whose strong larger body looked filthy and was covered in cuts, welts and bruises.<br><br>They fully looked like a delicate Princess with her subservient beast of burden.<br><br>Still half-asleep, Winnie blinked up at Jade, then instinctively moved to rise.<br><br>“No harness,” Jade said gently. “No tack. Come as you are.”<br><br>Winnie stood slowly, her body still aching from the day before. The marks were stark against her skin — across her abdomen, her rump, her thighs, even her hips. But she moved without shame.<br><br>They stepped together into the river.<br><br>The water was brisk, but the sun warmed their shoulders. They waded in slowly, letting the current swirl around their legs before dipping beneath it fully. For a few minutes, there was no sound but ripples and breath.<br><br>Side by side, they floated.<br><br>Equal in movement.<br><br>Jade's body — soft and untouched — contrasted with Winnie’s marked strength as they embraced like lovers.<br><br>The two of them laughed softly as the water lapped around their touching breasts.<br><br>“You were incredible yesterday,” Jade whispered, pressing her cheek against the side of her mount’s face. “Truly.”<br><br>Winnie let out a breath — part relief, part gratitude.<br><br>She wrapped her arms around Jade’s hips and lower back, lifting her slightly. Jade shifted, resting her weight across Winnie’s chest.<br><br>Winnie’s hands and forearms settled just beneath her — under her thighs, along her buttocks — holding her securely in place and lifting her further up.<br><br>Jade gave a quiet, amused smile. “You just want to be beneath me all the time.”<br><br>Winnie returned the smile, nodding. “I do.”<br><br>They stayed there for a moment — rider and mount, floating together in stillness. No saddles. No reins. Just warmth and service. And the quiet knowledge of what they were to each other.<br><br>Jade looked down at her.<br><br>“Do you ever still… resent me?”<br><br>Winnie blinked.<br><br>“No.”<br><br>Jade tilted her head. “Not at all? Not even for a few moments?”<br><br>Winnie exhaled, her arms adjusting slightly under Jade’s thighs to keep her comfortably afloat.<br><br>“I used to,” she admitted. “Fleetingly. In the beginning.”<br><br>“And now?”<br><br>“It’s rare. Less and less each day.” She met Jade’s eyes. “I adore you.”<br><br>Jade’s expression softened, uncertain whether to smile or cry.<br><br>Winnie added, voice barely above a whisper, “I feel like I was born to serve you.”<br><br>Jade closed her eyes briefly, as if the words physically washed over her.<br><br>Then she opened them again.<br><br>“Not even when I dig the spurs in?” she asked. “Or when I… whip you?”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer right away.<br><br>So Jade went on, gently: “I sit there in total comfort. I don’t sweat. I don’t ache. And when you slow down… I get to hurt you to make you go faster. That has to feel unfair.”<br><br>Winnie’s brows drew together — not in anger, but in thought.<br><br>“It did, at first,” she said. “Not in words. Just a feeling — frustration, maybe. Shock.” Her voice remained calm. “But I’ve been… adapting. I still am.”<br><br>Jade raised a hand and traced a light line down Winnie’s neck.<br><br>“How does it feel now?”<br><br>Winnie looked at her for a long time. Then answered simply: “Right.”<br><br>Jade didn’t speak for a while, enjoying her comfort and the flowing water. The birdsong from the trees filled the silence.<br><br>Then, finally, Jade asked, “Tell me. Describe it. What do you feel when I ride you?”<br><br>Winnie took a deep breath.<br><br>“It’s… grounding. Like I’m not guessing who I am anymore. My body is being used — but not disrespected, even when you really hurt me. I feel strong, even when I’m in pain. Especially then. Because I know I’m carrying someone I adore. Someone who owns me. And that allows the pain to make sense.”<br><br>Jade swallowed. Her voice was quiet when she spoke.<br><br>“And what about the worship? When I make you kiss my feet… lick them…”<br><br>Winnie’s face flushed slightly, but her smile was soft.<br><br>“It reminds me that I am not just your transport. I am meant to exist beneath you. You deserve softness, comfort, care. And I am meant to give it to you.”<br><br>Jade nodded slowly. “And when I dig the spurs in?”<br><br>Winnie hesitated. “It stings, especially the new spurs,” she said. “But it… aligns things. I stop thinking. I stop hesitating. I just obey. And part of me… is proud that I’m strong enough to take all the pain that you choose to give me.”<br><br>Jade gently traced a finger across Winnie’s cheek, feeling powerful and loved.<br><br>Winnie added, whispering now, “And I love that your feet don’t walk. Because of me.”<br><br>Jade looked down at her mount, her servant, her support — and her responsibility.<br><br>Then she asked, “Do you want to hear how it feels for me, when I ride you?”<br><br>Winnie nodded.<br><br>“I feel safe,” Jade said. “When I sit on you, I know you’ll carry me. I know I can go anywhere I choose without any effort. And I feel… powerful. Not cruel. Just… completely trusted. Like I have complete control over something beautiful and strong, and you give me that power freely.”<br><br>Winnie’s arms around her tightened slightly — not possessively, but protectively.<br><br>And Jade, now smiling softly, added: “You are so strong and athletic. But when you are under me… you make me feel like I am the one with that strength, because I know it’s completely mine to use.”<br><br>They stayed like that for a while, Winnie looking up adoringly, Jade looking down with a soft smile.<br><br>Winnie felt a shift in her rider’s expression and raised an eyebrow. “There’s more, isn’t there?”<br><br>Jade hesitated. Then nodded. “Yes, there’s something I didn’t admit before.”<br><br>Winnie waited, gently adjusting her grip to keep Jade secure and comfortable.<br><br>“When I ride you hard…” Jade began slowly, “when I dig the spurs into your sides… or hit you with the whip…”<br><br>She trailed off.<br><br>Winnie’s eyes didn’t leave hers.<br><br>“…I feel powerful,” Jade said, almost in a whisper. “Not just safe. Not just proud. Dominant. And, well… I enjoy it.”<br><br>Winnie’s head tilted. “Of course you do.”<br><br>“I mean—really enjoy it,” Jade continued, her voice quiet but honest. “There’s this feeling. Not cruel, not angry, but… this thrill. This sadistic spark, I guess. It’s like I feel how much you are giving me, and yet some part of me wants to push further. To take more. To press harder. Just because I can.”<br><br>She swallowed.<br><br>“But it doesn’t mean I don’t respect you. I do. I admire you more than anyone. That hasn’t changed.”<br><br>Winnie didn’t blink.<br><br>Instead, she smiled.<br><br>“I get it,” she said simply.<br><br>“You do?”<br><br>Winnie gave a soft laugh. “I would probably feel it too. In fact…” she looked off for a second, then back, “I have.”<br><br>Jade raised an eyebrow.<br><br>“There was this old farm horse my aunt let me ride, twice. Not for long, just around a field. But I felt it. That same power. That same thrill — sitting high, making it move under me exactly how I wanted.”<br><br>She gave a shrug.<br><br>“It’s natural. You’re riding me because you own me. And riding means control. Why shouldn’t you enjoy it?”<br><br>Jade laughed softly. “You always know exactly what to say.”<br><br>“And you,” Winnie said, giving her hips a gentle squeeze, “always know how to ride me just right… whether you are in the saddle… or sitting on my face…”<br><br>As she highlighted those last words with a coy smile, Winnie bent her legs and got down into the water, letting go of Jade’s rump only to place her shoulders underneath the smaller girl’s thighs. A moment later, she emerged from the water, lifting Jade up in a reverse shoulder ride.<br><br>She placed her hands on Jade’s butt cheeks to keep her comfortable, and she immediately dove with her mouth between Jade’s thighs.<br><br>Winnie began licking… clearly eager to worship her owner, to give her pleasure while keeping her elevated and comfortable…<br><br>But Jade did not relax into her adoring mouth. “Wait, I can’t right now…”<br><br>Winnie looked up at her with a surprised expression.<br><br>“The thing is… we just woke up, and I really need to pee…” Jade admitted with a hint of embarrassment, thinking that she could hop off to take care of her needs and then resume their lovemaking.<br><br>But Winnie held her in place, and opened her mouth wide. She looked up at Jade with her most worshipful expression, waiting.<br><br>It took Jade a couple of seconds to understand. “Oh, Winnie…” she said then, blushing. “That is not necessary today… We are literally standing in freshwater…”<br><br>But Winnie simply stayed in that position, quietly reinforcing the offer through her most submissive expression as she looked up into Jade’s pretty blue eyes.<br><br>“You just want it… Don’t you?” Jade whispered, her voice trembling from emotion and arousal. <br><br>Feelings of power and dominance quickly flooded her brain, so she continued with a more confident voice: “You exist to serve me in every way. So it’s only natural that I use your mouth to relieve myself, any time it’s the most convenient place for me… Isn’t that right?”<br><br>Winnie’s mouth was still wide open – her lips stretched around Jade’s entire vulva – but she found a way to nod, slightly yet decisively. She felt her own pussy getting all warm and wet as she degraded herself, basically accepting that her mouth was now going to be a portable toilet always available for Jade to use.<br><br>However her attention had to quickly shift to breathing and gulping, as Jade relaxed her bladder and began to piss into her mouth.<br><br>It was Winnie’s first time receiving her owner’s morning pee. <br><br>It was stronger and more abundant than anything she had ever swallowed before. It seemingly kept coming for over a minute. And Jade made no effort to slow down her flow, aware that they were naked and standing in water, so there was no mess to be possibly made.<br><br>But Winnie wanted to swallow every drop. She couldn’t stand the thought of disappointing her superior owner. So she kept gulping, and gagging… and coughing… while Jade observed her complete degradation from above with a sadistic smile, never breaking eye contact with her struggling slave.<br><br>Overwhelmed by lust, Jade got Winnie’s nose to push slightly against her clit and exploded in an almost immediate orgasm, flooding Winnie’s mouth with her love juices while it was still swallowing the last gulp of her pee.<br><br>***<br><br>Minutes later, Jade sat nestled in Winnie’s lap, arms lightly draped around her shoulders, the water swaying softly at their waists. She could feel how their relationship had just taken another big step.<br><br>Her voice was calm now, but her next question carried weight.<br><br>“What if I rode you really hard sometimes?” she asked, eyes steady. “All out. Not for survival. Not to win anything. Just because… I wanted to. Because I liked the speed, the wind in my hair. Because it felt good.”<br><br>She hesitated. She looked at Winnie’s strong yet feminine body, at the intense expression of her deep green eyes.<br><br>“What if I was selfish?”<br><br>Winnie didn’t answer right away.<br><br>Then she smiled.<br><br>Warmly. Deeply. Freely.<br><br>“I want you to be,” she said.<br><br>Jade blinked.<br><br>“I want you to be selfish. I want you to use me — even if it’s just to feel free, or dominant. That wouldn’t make me feel abused. Your dominance only makes me feel owned. And I… like that.”<br><br>Her voice remained steady, even as her breath hitched softly.<br><br>“I don’t want to be your equal, Jade. I want to be your ponygirl. Your mount. Your slave. I want your weight on me, your reins guiding me, your feet resting and commanding me.”<br><br>She paused.<br><br>“Actually, I think I’m getting addicted to that feeling.”<br><br>Jade's eyes softened, her lips parting not in surprise — but in quiet understanding. She leaned forward, touched her forehead to Winnie’s.<br><br>“I don’t deserve you,” she whispered.<br><br>“You do,” Winnie replied, her hands firm around Jade’s back. “And I’ll keep reminding you until you believe it.”<br><br>The kiss that followed wasn’t rushed.<br><br>It wasn’t for show.<br><br>It was an exchange — of trust, of surrender, of silent vows.<br><br>Across the riverbank, three goblins paused mid-motion.<br><br>Tarak looked curiously, one brow raised. Malgrin grunted something inaudible and turned back to coiling ropes.<br><br>But Sena watched longer. And though she said nothing, the look in her eyes was not just one of surprise. It showed something like admiration.<br><br>Because she had rarely seen a bond quite like that — not just of dominance over another, but of mutual clarity in roles that were accepted, embraced, and even loved.<br><br>And in the stillness after the kiss, there was no question who Jade was.<br><br>And who Winnie had chosen to become for her.<br><br>***<br><br>The river had cooled and cleansed them, and after the previous day's punishing march, the warmth of the morning sun felt like a gift. <br><br>Fires were kindled. Bread was toasted. Dried fruit, grain mash, and salted meats were passed around without ceremony.<br><br>Winnie was on all-fours, serving quietly and steadily as Jade’s chair. Her body was still sore — stiff in the thighs, the lower back, the shoulders — but far less than she had feared. <br><br>She chewed her breakfast slowly and carefully, watching Jade speak quietly with Sena over the map.<br><br>By midmorning, they set off.<br><br>Winnie carried Jade with slow strength — not fast, but steady. Her footsteps were sure, her head held straight, her breath calm. Jade rode with quiet pride.<br><br>As the landscape changed from forested foothills to open meadows and narrow roads, they began to see signs of civilization: old stone markers, moss-covered statues, and finally a crumbling road that curved toward a wooded rise.<br><br>At the top of that ridge, they saw it.<br><br>Elmsworth Academy.<br><br>The school seemed to occupy an entire castle — ancient, ivy-wrapped, dignified. Its tall towers loomed over the walls like watchful sentinels. Smoke curled from chimneys. Flags hung motionless in the windless air.<br><br>But something else lingered there too.<br><br>Tension.<br><br>Sena held up a hand.<br><br>They slowed.<br><br>From the trees beside the path, a goblin scout appeared — mounted on a tall, pale-skinned ponygirl with iron rings at her cheeks.<br><br>He called out in a sharp dialect, and Sena answered swiftly.<br><br>After a few words, he waved them through the trees toward a makeshift camp — and within minutes, Jade and the others stood in the presence of a war party. Goblins clustered around fires, inspecting weapons, sharpening blades. Three human girls, recently captured and still untrained, knelt in chains in a small pen.<br><br>The chief emerged from a heavy canvas tent.<br><br>He was broader than Sena, with an uneven braid of iron-colored hair and a heavy traveling cloak. His eyes scanned each rider before settling on Sena with surprise.<br><br>“Sena of Irgrak,” he said in his gravelly voice.<br><br>“Grathun,” she replied. “Didn’t expect to see your tribe this far west.”<br><br>Grathun snorted. “Didn’t expect Irgrak to be exporting riders this way either.”<br><br>She offered a faint smirk. “We’re here on a mission of peace, and we ask you for safe passage into the castle.”<br><br>He narrowed his eyes.<br><br>Sena gestured toward Jade. “This is Jade. Human girlrider. She’s trying to establish a relationship between us goblins and a human outpost. This one.” She nodded toward the school. “They train ponygirls. Their elite girls already embrace our customs.”<br><br>Grathun folded his arms. “We’ve been at this siege for two days. Only captured three girls before they all got cooped up behind the walls. And you want me to walk away? For what?”<br><br>Jade leaned forward in her saddle.<br><br>“If this works,” she said, her voice clear and steady, “you won’t have to raid villages or siege castles anymore. You might be able to buy trained ponygirls from humans directly. Saddle-broken. Bit-trained. Obedient.”<br><br>Grathun raised an eyebrow.<br><br>“And if it doesn’t work?”<br><br>Sena raised the tone of her voice slightly. “Then you’ll have given peace a chance.”<br><br>“I am not sure about this,” Grathun blurted out. “But I guess there is no harm in letting you go in for a meeting.”`],
      7: ["Chapter 7", `The four travelers were offered a tent in the goblin camp, and they began planning their next steps.<br><br>But Jade wanted to go in by herself. She met Sena’s gaze calmly. “If I show up with goblins behind me, they’ll assume it’s an ultimatum. Or a trick.”<br><br>Sena opened her mouth, but Jade continued.<br><br>“Some humans are ready to accept your customs. But not when they’re under siege. They might not even listen if you are with me. Let me earn their trust first, by showing up alone as... a fellow human rider...”<br><br>Tarak, lounging nearby, added with a shrug, “They can’t escape anywhere. I don’t see the harm.”<br><br>Sena gave him a dark look, then sighed. “Fine. But if you don’t return by sundown, we’ll come in after you.”<br><br>“Understood,” Jade said.<br><br>Winnie knelt obediently, and Jade swung herself into the saddle. With a firm tug of the reins and a tap of her spurs, they began their steady walk toward the gate.<br><br>The outer walls loomed high above them, mossy stone capped with battlements. A narrow drawbridge was lowered, though the portcullis behind it was still half-closed. Two guards stood at its base — one armored in chainmail, the other wearing a student’s tabard with a sword at his hip.<br><br>They both stared in disbelief.<br><br>A girl.<br><br>Riding another girl.<br><br>Saddled. Pierced. Subservient.<br><br>The younger guard stepped forward. “What… what is the meaning of this?”<br><br>Jade reined Winnie to a halt.<br><br>“My name is Jade, and I am your best chance at peace,” she said. “I’d like to speak to whoever is in charge — and to Beth Tiernan. She’s a student here. My ponygirl here is her cousin.”<br><br>Beth’s name seemed to strike something. The guard glanced toward his partner, then stepped aside and waved them through the gate.<br><br>The courtyard beyond was wide and paved in stone, dotted with trimmed hedges and shaded benches. <br><br>There was a clear atmosphere of emergency and disruption, but most people seemed calm.<br><br>Students stood gathered around the perimeter — some in uniforms, others in simple robes — murmuring, watching, eyes wide.<br><br>A few professors emerged as well, and several more guards with spears waited in tense confusion.<br><br>Winnie kept walking, a bit intimidated to be ridden by Jade – naked and harnessed – in front of so many humans.<br><br>Jade guided her to the center of the courtyard with perfect poise, her reins firm, her back straight, her expression calm. She wanted every eye to see the control and unity she possessed with her mount.<br><br>When they reached the center, Jade slowed Winnie to a halt.<br><br>Then, with a gentle tap of her riding crop on Winnie’s breasts, she got her to kneel and she dismounted smoothly, landing with grace.<br><br>She looked up and spoke with clarity: “Hello everyone. My name is Jade. And I come in peace.”<br><br>She placed a hand on Winnie’s head.<br><br>“This here is Winnie. She is my ponygirl.”<br><br>Murmurs rose. Someone gasped softly. Another laughed nervously.<br><br>Jade began unbuckling the saddle straps — unfastening the harness, the stirrups, the reins. She worked quickly but with care, folding each piece and placing it at her feet.<br><br>Soon, all that remained were the steel rings on Winnie’s cheeks and chest — evidence of her role, symbols of her status.<br><br>Jade reached into her saddlebag and pulled out a thin gray blanket.<br><br>She offered it to Winnie, who wrapped it around her body with quiet dignity, covering her nudity.<br><br>Then she looked up, as if waking up her own humanity. And she spoke for the first time. “I am Winnie Tiernan,” she said. “I came here looking for my cousin. Is Beth here?”<br><br>There was a stir in the crowd. A few students turned, parting slightly as a small figure emerged — looking stunned.<br><br>She was in her early twenties, petite and graceful, with olive skin and long black hair braided down her back. Her uniform was hastily worn, her expression tight with suspicion.<br><br>Her eyes locked on Jade first — then drifted to Winnie.<br><br>“You are… being ridden?” she asked, disbelieving. “What happened to you? Were you captured and trained by the goblins?”<br><br>Winnie stood slowly, still wrapped in the blanket.<br><br>And walked toward her.<br><br>“Hi, Beth,” she said, her voice trembling slightly. “It’s… a long story.”<br><br>Beth stared at Winnie’s face for a second, clearly stunned to see her cheek rings. She turned to Jade, brow furrowed. “What did you do to her?”<br><br>Before Jade could answer, Winnie stepped closer. “She didn’t make me do anything. I chose this. She found a way to keep me safe. And I serve her because I want to.”<br><br>Beth’s lips parted.<br><br>And something in her face — tight with fear — softened into wonder.<br><br>She took one step forward.<br><br>Then another.<br><br>And then they were in each other’s arms. Winnie hugged her tightly. Beth clung to her.<br><br>And over her cousin’s shoulder, Beth looked again at Jade — and gave her a small, cautious nod of thanks. Then, surprising them both… she stepped forward and hugged Jade, too.<br><br>***<br><br>The headmistress’s office was high in the central tower — a broad, circular room with stone walls, tall arched windows, and bookshelves that reached the ceiling. A long table stretched across its center, now surrounded by professors in travel-worn robes and leather doublets, their faces a mix of curiosity, concern, and disbelief.<br><br>The headmistress sat at the end.<br><br>Lady Calwynn was regal in posture and bearing, her pale skin framed by a silver pin holding back glossy chestnut hair. Her dark eyes were unreadable, and she wore a black dress with tailored sleeves and leather boots, as if she were always ready for movement. <br><br>Power radiated from her not in volume — but in stillness.<br><br>Jade stood beside the table, Winnie and Beth flanking her like shadows of her journey — one shaped by submission, the other by fresh awakening.<br><br>“I know what I’m asking you to consider,” Jade said, her voice firm but respectful. “But let me start by explaining how I came to this.”<br><br>She walked slowly along the edge of the table, hands clasped behind her back.<br><br>“A group of us fled a goblin raid. We found shelter in a cave. We survived. But we had no strength to fight, few weapons, no numbers.”<br><br>The professors listened, some skeptical, some leaning forward.<br><br>“Then we noticed something strange,” Jade continued. “During a scouting trip, a goblin let two of us pass unharmed — because they were Winnie’s sister Olivia riding on her brother’s back, saddled, bridled… as if he were a beast of burden. The goblin saw control. Saw structure. And to them, that meant civilization.”<br><br>Beth nodded quietly beside her.<br><br>Jade glanced at the headmistress, then back to the table. “So we leaned into that. Not as deception — but as survival.”<br><br>“So this kept working?” one of the professors asked. A stern woman in green robes, arms folded.<br><br>“It didn’t just work to keep us safe,” Jade said. “It radically transformed how they looked at us. I was treated as an equal among goblins, and I spent over a week in their village, as someone who shared their way of life. And because of that, I was able to discuss a possible path toward peace — not as a prisoner, but as a partner.”<br><br>A burly man with thick forearms and a grizzled beard scoffed. “You can’t expect us all to go riding around or cracking whips like circus folks. That’s madness.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “I agree. It’s not realistic. Not everyone is fit to ride or to be ridden.” She paused. “But it doesn’t have to be everyone. Even some goblins don’t ride.”<br><br>That caught their attention.<br><br>Jade continued, gesturing calmly.<br><br>“What I propose is a designated guard of petite riders and strong-bodied mounts. A visible symbol of discipline and control. Of human mastery over our own. That’s what goblins respect. If we appear structured, ordered — then we are worth trading with. Not raiding.”<br><br>Silence settled over the room.<br><br>Then Lady Calwynn leaned forward, fingers laced in front of her lips.<br><br>“That’s the most promising idea I have heard in months,” she said. Her voice was low and clear. “It may be unconventional. It will probably become controversial. But goblin attacks have bled us dry for months. And if there is even a chance to change that without another bloodbath…” She let her words trail.<br><br>The burly professor looked stunned.<br><br>Several others began murmuring to one another.<br><br>Jade gave a small nod of gratitude. “Thank you, Headmistress. But I must be honest. For the goblin chief outside to grant me passage, I had to imply that this school had already adopted such customs.”<br><br>“What does that mean for us?” asked the green-robed professor, voice tight.<br><br>“It means,” Jade said, “that by the end of the day, they’ll be expecting to see a new kind of order among us — one that mirrors theirs.”<br><br>Lady Calwynn stood slowly. “Then we had better start building it right away.”<br><br>***<br><br>The plan came together fast — as it was necessary.<br><br>Jade and Headmistress Calwynn stood side by side near the balcony overlooking the courtyard. Below them, students gathered in growing clusters, murmuring with anticipation and confusion. <br><br>Professors lined the walkways, forming a boundary. Tension hung in the air, but it wasn’t fear.<br><br>It was the weight of change.<br><br>Calwynn stepped forward.<br><br>“Students,” she called, her voice ringing clear across the courtyard. “You’ve all seen the guest who arrived this morning. Her name is Jade, and she carries with her a truth that may change how we survive and then thrive in this world.”<br><br>Whispers rippled.<br><br>“She is here as an envoy — not only of goblins, but of possibility. Today, we begin something that may save us from raids, from sieges, from loss. We will begin to adopt — visibly and proudly — a structure the goblins understand and respect.”<br><br>She raised her hand to stop the ensuing murmuring. “I am now asking for volunteers. And I would prefer not having to add conscripts.”<br><br>Everybody quieted at those last words.<br><br>“To my professors: divide the students into three groups. First, identify the volunteers who are petite, clever, and composed — those who are fit to become riders.”<br><br>Twelve students ended up in that group — a few eager, most hesitant, but resolved. Among them stood Beth.<br><br>“Second,” the headmistress said, “we need the strongest. Tall, athletic, sure-footed — of any gender. You will be the mounts.”<br><br>Fourteen ended up in that group. Even more surprising, some did so with pride. A pair of older boys in training outfits. A tall girl who had run the archery course with record times. A quiet scholarship boy with broad shoulders. No shame. Just proud acceptance.<br><br>Headmistress Calwynn nodded once, satisfied.<br><br>“There are more mounts than riders,” she said aloud. “That leaves two unmatched. I will ride one.”<br><br>A quiet gasp.<br><br>“Professor Ellinor, will you ride the other one?”<br><br>A stern-looking woman in her forties with braided gray-blond hair gave a crisp nod. “Yes.”<br><br>Calwynn turned to Jade, who stepped forward, unfastening the side flap of her saddlebag and extracting her old saddle and tack.<br><br>“I came prepared for this,” she said. “This is my original tack — the saddle and gear I originally used to ride Winnie, before I reached the goblin town and purchased better equipment. It’s older, but sound.”<br><br>She handed the worn, compact saddle and its harness to Professor Rennel — a pragmatic woman in charge of the stables and woodworking.<br><br>“It would be very helpful if you could fashion thirteen more like it,” the Headmistress instructed her professor. “Use what’s in the stables — equestrian saddles, tack, stirrup straps. Make them fit for people, instead of horses.”<br><br>Professor Rennel nodded, already forming a plan.<br><br>She turned to some of the non-volunteer students. “You’re with me.”<br><br>They moved quickly, heading down toward the stable yard.<br><br>In the meantime, the courtyard was being cleared and partitioned.<br><br>Jade led her group — the selected riders and mounts, including herself and Winnie — to a shaded quadrant at the far end, walled in by low hedges and a dry fountain. Beth stayed close to Winnie, now dressed in a clean student uniform, her dark braid tucked neatly over her shoulder.<br><br>Jade looked over the group.<br><br>Fourteen would-be mounts in one line, and their future riders across from them.<br><br>All of them wore expressions of nervous anticipation.<br><br>Some were blushing. Some were trying to look stoic. Some — like the Headmistress — radiated total calm.<br><br>“This,” Jade said, stepping to the center, “is the beginning.”<br><br>She made eye contact with each rider.<br><br>“You will sit in the saddle. You will guide them. You will command.”<br><br>Then she looked at the mounts.<br><br>“And you — you are strong. You will carry. You will endure. And you will obey without question. We don’t have enough time to build a connection as deep as the one I have with my ponygirl, but our survival depends on creating one convincing enough for the goblin leaders out there.”<br><br>She gave them a moment to absorb that.<br><br>“Sena — one of the goblins I travel with — agreed to wait until sunset before entering. That gives us just a few hours to prepare.”<br><br>Murmurs followed.<br><br>Jade stood at the center with Lady Calwynn and Professor Ellinor beside her, the three women forming the new axis of a social order still being written.<br><br>“Pairing,” Jade said, addressing her two partners with a lower voice, “can mean everything.”<br><br>She looked across the rows of waiting volunteers — some shifting nervously, others watching with anticipation.<br><br>“A mount must be strong, yes. But strength alone isn’t enough. They must have a reason to follow. To submit. Sometimes that’s open admiration. Sometimes it’s something more difficult to see — hidden by resentment, resistance, even pride.”<br><br>She rested a hand gently on Winnie’s shoulder beside her.<br><br>“Winnie wasn’t exactly friendly to me in the beginning. She challenged me. She even disliked me, I think.”<br><br>Winnie gave a small, amused smile.<br><br>“But I saw something underneath,” Jade continued. “And now she encourages me to ride her harder. To be more selfish. Because that makes her feel owned. Needed. Used with purpose.”<br><br>She paused, then nodded to the headmistress. “You know your students. But you’ll want to consider more than just strength and intellect. Look for that hidden dynamic.”<br><br>Lady Calwynn turned slightly to Professor Ellinor. “You’ve taught them in the field and in the classroom. You know them best. I defer to your judgment.”<br><br>Ellinor gave a short nod and stepped forward, eyes sweeping the group with quiet efficiency.<br><br>“I’ll begin.”<br><br>She pointed to a tall, freckled farm boy — broad-shouldered and bashful, who had already begun flushing under the intensity of the moment.<br><br>“Galen. You’re with me.”<br><br>His eyes widened. He looked down, only to glance at her shapely legs, just as he had done so often during lectures.<br><br>Professor Ellinor’s voice was dry but kind. “Strip. Then get down on your hands and knees.”<br><br>He obeyed — flushed and slow, but without protest. When he was ready, Professor Ellinor walked up to him and sat on his bare back, using it like a human bench, adjusting herself until balanced. Her posture was composed, effortless.<br><br>Everyone looked stunned, just as intended.<br><br>Then she glanced at the headmistress.<br><br>“Your turn, Lady Calwynn,” she said. Her gaze landed on a tall, muscular boy with styled hair, perfect posture, and a confident expression. He had volunteered quickly — too quickly, as if making it a matter of pride. “Dorian, you will have the honor of serving our headmistress.”<br><br>He straightened, almost smugly. He opened his mouth, then thought better of it.<br><br>Wordlessly, he nodded and stripped. When he got down on all fours, Calwynn stepped forward — a symbol of elegance and absolute command — and lowered herself with grace onto his young back, making it sag slightly under her. She sat tall, letting the weight settle, and said nothing.<br><br>A circle began to form, as Professor Ellinor continued the pairing process, turning athletic students into naked human benches for their smaller peers.<br><br>Silas — a slight, pale boy with wide eyes and nervous hands, had been the only male rider to volunteer. His small size had been the target of endless mocking throughout the school year, and he carried himself with the resulting insecurity.<br><br>Ellinor pointed to Martina, the school’s best sprinter and a former fencing champion.<br><br>She blinked. “But I am not… he’s…”<br><br>“You’re with him,” Ellinor said.<br><br>Martina hesitated, then saw the resolve in the professor’s eyes.<br><br>She stripped. And knelt. And made herself into a beautiful human bench.<br><br>Silas approached awkwardly — then sat sideways on her strong, naked back with a sudden hop, as if punishing her indecision by plopping down harder than necessary.<br><br>Then came Beth. Ellinor didn’t hesitate. “Marla will be your mount.”<br><br>A tall, softly built girl with strong legs and a quiet demeanor stepped forward. Marla smiled faintly, eyes betraying more emotion than her voice ever had.<br><br>Marla stripped, knelt down on all fours — and Beth settled onto her carefully, adjusting the skirt of her uniform to preserve modesty.<br><br>More pairs followed.<br><br>Each new pairing added another figure to the ring forming in the courtyard: a circle of strong, naked backs and composed young riders seated upon them, their roles no longer theoretical.<br><br>Fifteen pairs, including Jade and Winnie.<br><br>Perfectly still.<br><br>Ready.<br><br>Jade’s voice rang out over the hush. “You are no longer students and classmates.” She looked at each face in the circle. “You are riders and mounts. Your first lesson begins now.”<br><br>The courtyard was silent with purpose.<br><br>Jade sat on Winnie’s naked body, placed on all fours just like the other human ponies. She shifted her riding crop slightly in her hand, then she swung one leg to straddle Winnie and face the same direction as her mount, her feet hanging in the air along Winnie’s arms.<br><br>Then tap — a light strike to Winnie’s left upper arm.<br><br>Winnie turned slightly, pivoting her knees with precision to rotate her body. Jade remained seated, graceful and effortless.<br><br>Another tap.<br><br>Another shift.<br><br>She began to turn her mount — slowly, evenly — until she had faced the entire circle.<br><br>Only then did she begin to speak.<br><br>“What we are doing here,” Jade said, “is not a performance. We don’t have time for that.”<br><br>Her voice was firm but calm, loud enough to carry.<br><br>“The kind of connection that we need can’t be faked for the benefit of the goblins or anyone else. They are too perceptive. They will see through it if we merely pretend.”<br><br>Tap. Winnie shifted. Jade faced the next rider.<br><br>“This must be real.”<br><br>She met each rider’s eyes as she rotated around the circle, her mount adjusting silently beneath her.<br><br>“Mounts — your job is not just to carry. It is to submit. You are not victims. You are strong, and you are choosing to serve for the common good. But that service must come from a place of truth.”<br><br>She paused, letting the words settle.<br><br>“And riders,” she said, her voice a little softer now, “your job is to command. To sit tall. To guide with confidence. And yes — to push. Sometimes hard. Sometimes selfishly. The goblins expect that. They respect that.”<br><br>Tap. Shift.<br><br>Jade turned again to address the next portion of the circle.<br><br>“But you are not tyrants. Your power comes with a responsibility — to protect, to care, to ensure your pony is not just functional, but willing. You must learn to check in. Not constantly, of course. But at least daily. Speak with them. Know when you are demanding too much, or when they want to give even more.”<br><br>There was a ripple of breath through the riders.<br><br>“And let me be clear,” Jade continued. “Your mount’s submission is not a license for abuse. We are not goblins enslaving a different species. We are all human. Let our strength lie in how we use the system — not in how we misuse it.”<br><br>She stopped turning.<br><br>Winnie had brought her full circle, now facing the headmistress and Professor Ellinor, still seated on their own new mounts.<br><br>Jade sat straighter, her hands resting lightly on her thighs.<br><br>“This is the beginning of something new. Not everyone will understand it. But those who ride and carry today must commit to doing it with truth, or not at all.”<br><br>She looked around the circle once more.<br><br>“Are you ready to begin?”<br><br>The courtyard was still, but every breath held anticipation.<br><br>Jade shifted back to straddle the middle section of Winnie’s back, who remained a platform of obedience beneath her weight.<br><br>The other fourteen riders followed her example.<br><br>“This first phase is not about speed, or strength, or show. It’s about communication. Trust. Presence. With nothing but your bodies.”<br><br>She held up her hand and gently smacked Winnie’s rump.<br><br>Winnie shifted, crawling forward two paces, then halting with a soft exhale when Jade pulled her hair firmly.<br><br>Jade smiled faintly and tapped her thigh with a heel. Winnie turned in the opposite direction. Then Jade showed how to obtain the same turn by turning Winnie’s head, with her hand holding her hair.<br><br>“Use signals,” Jade instructed. “Touch. Tap. Pressure. Speak only when needed, until you don’t need it anymore. Your ponies must feel your commands. Learn their rhythm.”<br><br>The riders took a breath.<br><br>And the courtyard moved.<br><br>A quiet procession began — ponygirls and ponyboys crawling slowly, carrying their riders in random directions around the courtyard’s interior.<br><br>Some moved almost gracefully from the start.<br><br>Lady Calwynn sat on Dorian’s back with regal composure, her legs draped elegantly on his sides as he crawled forward. She guided him with heel taps and steady hair pulls. When he hesitated at a turn, she tugged his hair sharply and smacked his flank with her open hand. He gritted his teeth — stunned to be hit by his headmistress on his naked butt — but he obeyed.<br><br>Professor Ellinor’s mount, the shy boy Galen, was visibly trembling under her weight. Not from tiredness yet, but rather from emotion. She rode him with calm authority — issuing precise commands, and he gradually relaxed into her lead. Soon there was unspoken understanding in that pair — and, Jade noted, something that had clearly waited for release.<br><br>Beth, by contrast, seemed unsteady. She sat composed and comfortable on Marla’s strong, tall back, but her hands hovered awkwardly — not wanting to tug her hair too hard, nor tap with her heels. Marla crawled dutifully, but her direction faltered without confident cues. Jade could see it clearly: Beth’s kindness was holding her back, as if afraid to misuse her friend’s quiet affection.<br><br>And then there was Silas.<br><br>One of the smallest riders — perched atop Martina’s strong back like a boy playing general. His posture was rigid. His eyes darted sharply. And from the first moment, his grip on the girl’s hair was tight.<br><br>Jade frowned.<br><br>“Turn left,” Silas barked suddenly, before anyone else had spoken aloud.<br><br>Martina turned — slowly, carefully.<br><br>“Faster!” he snapped, kicking her urgently.<br><br>Jade’s brow tightened.<br><br>Martina picked up her crawl — visibly uncomfortable with their dynamic, her arms trembling slightly under the tension.<br><br>When she slowed again at a corner, Silas gave a sharp smack on her rump — too much, too soon.<br><br>Jade knew they had no time to get picky and make changes, but she made a mental note. Watch him closely.<br><br>After several loops and rotations, Jade called the group to a halt.<br><br>Down the path from the stable came a student-led procession — carrying makeshift saddles and harnesses crafted from leather and salvaged tack, along with stirrups and reins.<br><br>Jade lifted one, examining it.<br><br>“Time to move forward.”<br><br>She stood beside Winnie’s kneeling form and demonstrated: first the chest harness, looping over her ribs and under her arms. Then the saddle — padded, braced, strapped firmly into place as Winnie’s forearms were cuffed right beneath it. <br><br>Stirrup leathers were next, and Jade clipped them on swiftly. “My ponygirl got some enhancements,” Jade said proudly. “Your leathers will clip to the chest harness for now.”<br><br>“Now the reins,” she said, attaching them to the cheek rings at Winnie’s face. “Your mounts will have a bit, instead of face rings.”<br><br>“All goblin riders use spurs,” she added, lifting one boot to show the gleaming rowels already secured to her heels. “So we will do the same. And every rider will receive a whip. A riding crop, to be specific. You must use these tools firmly, but responsibly.”<br><br>She mounted Winnie, then rode her around with precision as she supervised the first harnessing of fourteen new human mounts.<br><br>Once ready, one by one, riders climbed onto saddled backs, shifting, adjusting.<br><br>The final hour of training began under a long shadow.<br><br>The courtyard, now full of purposeful movement, had taken on a rhythm: pairs walking, halting, kneeling, rising. The creak of saddles, the soft rustle of reins, the steady cadence of spurs tapping flanks in command.<br><br>But beneath the generally positive flow, Jade saw some small fractures. And she knew they had to be addressed before sunset.<br><br>First she trotted lightly toward the far side of the courtyard, where Beth was walking Marla in tight, careful circles.<br><br>“Beth,” she said.<br><br>Beth straightened, adjusting her grip on the reins. “Yes?”<br><br>“You’re not doing badly,” Jade said gently. “Your seat is balanced. Your cues are readable. But your hesitation is showing.”<br><br>Beth bit her lip. “I just… she’s one of my best friends. I don’t want to hurt her.”<br><br>“Do you think she volunteered for this without knowing what it meant?” Jade asked.<br><br>Beth glanced down at Marla — who remained still, strong, silent beneath her. Then she shook her head. “No.”<br><br>“Then give her the dignity of the role she chose,” Jade said. “You’re not humiliating her by leading. You’re honoring her by trusting she can carry your weight, literally and symbolically.”<br><br>Beth hesitated. “But I’m not sure I can be… dominant like you.”<br><br>“You don’t need to be like me,” Jade said. “You just need to believe that you belong where you’re sitting.”<br><br>Beth looked down again, then nodded.<br><br>Next in Jade’s list came Silas.<br><br>The small young man was a blur of sharp commands and rigid posture. His rein-hand was too tight. His use of the spurs was too frequent, and unnecessarily hurtful. His tone had only grown louder as the day wore on — barking orders instead of giving cues. Martina was trying her best beneath him, her face taut, her stride stuttering slightly each time he jerked the reins.<br><br>Jade rode Winnie up beside them.<br><br>“Silas,” she said sharply.<br><br>He slowed, looking up. “Yes?”<br><br>“Dismount.”<br><br>He blinked. “Why?”<br><br>“Now.”<br><br>Something in her tone — low, cold, authoritative — made him obey.<br><br>“What you are showing here is not leadership. You’re treating her like she’s not a person. Like you’ve been handed a slave to punish.”<br><br>Silas flushed. “I didn’t mean—”<br><br>“You did,” Jade interrupted. “You meant to dominate. And that’s not what this is. If you want to ride a human being, Silas, then you must honor the gift of her obedience. You must earn her strength and obedience, not rip it from her.”<br><br>He looked down, unsure.<br><br>“You’ll redo every drill at half speed, and every time you give her a command, you’ll think first about whether you’re worthy of being carried.”<br><br>Silas nodded quickly.<br><br>“No. Don’t just nod. Say it.”<br><br>“…Yes, Jade.”<br><br>“Good,” she said. “Now mount her. Slowly. Gently. And let’s start over.”<br><br>Jade tapped Winnie with the spurs, and the girl obediently turned toward a pair moving near the north archway: Professor Ellinor, riding Galen.<br><br>They were almost flawless.<br><br>Galen carried her upright, strong and eager. Ellinor’s posture was impeccable — chin high, heels planted, whip resting across her thighs like a baton of command. She had the look of someone born to rule.<br><br>But her hands never eased on the reins. Jade guided Winnie alongside them, matching their pace.<br><br>“Professor,” she said softly.<br><br>Ellinor glanced over.<br><br>“You’re setting a high bar. Precision. Confidence. Effortless dominance.”<br><br>Ellinor inclined her head slightly. “Thank you.”<br><br>“But remember,” Jade continued, her voice even, “you don’t need to restrain him to keep him loyal. Let the reins go slack now and then. Show him that you trust his obedience, and you don’t need to constantly force it.”<br><br>Ellinor looked down at Galen — then loosened the reins in her grip by just a finger’s width.<br><br>Jade nodded once and rode on.<br><br>Next, she approached the woman who, in some ways, had become her partner in leadership: Lady Calwynn.<br><br>The headmistress rode regally on Dorian’s back. Her boots gleamed. Her spurs had already left faint cuts along her mount’s hips — not bloody, not careless, but precise. She rode like a woman born to be served, treating her student like she owned him.<br><br>Dorian seemed proud — though occasionally bordering on defiant — but Jade could see in his expression that he was trying hard because she gave him so little ground.<br><br>Jade pulled alongside her.<br><br>“Lady Calwynn,” she said quietly, “you ride him like you’ve done it your whole life.”<br><br>The headmistress smiled slightly. “I understand discipline. And how to wear it visibly.”<br><br>“He respects that,” Jade said. “And it works. But remember: he’s not tireless. And of course you and Professor Illinor are not as lightweight as the younger riders.”<br><br>“That’s fair. But what if I need to really push him?” she asked.<br><br>Jade smiled. “Then make sure he knows why. Even the best mounts will run farther if they believe the destination is worth it. And soon enough, the only reason he will need is the fact that you demand it.”<br><br>Calwynn gave a faint nod. “And you, Jade?” she asked.<br><br>“Yes?”<br><br>“You speak like someone who never wanted to be in charge — and then learned she had no choice.”<br><br>Jade’s expression relaxed into a warm, knowing smile.<br><br>***<br><br>The courtyard went quiet as the headmistress assembled the group for their first official ride.<br><br>Fifteen riders sat mounted on their ponygirls and ponyboys. Across from them, the great wooden doors groaned softly on their hinges, nearly ready to open.<br><br>Then came the voice.<br><br>“Headmistress!”<br><br>Lady Calwynn turned, her weight steadily supported by the student that was now her personal human mount.<br><br>Professor Merton — a stooped, gray-bearded man who had taught philosophy and classical languages for three decades, was the one trying to obtain her attention.<br><br>“You can still reconsider,” he said. “You’re about to ride out there, in full view, mounted like… like something from a goblin parade… all based on the words of one girl. What if she’s wrong?”<br><br>His voice was low but urgent. “What if they don’t respect it? What if it’s all a ruse — and they start killing and kidnapping the moment you exit the gate?”<br><br>A ripple passed through a few of the students nearby.<br><br>Even Dorian, beneath her, flinched slightly. But Lady Calwynn’s eyes didn’t waver.<br><br>“It just makes sense,” she said calmly. She looked out across the yard, where the castle walls met the open sky. “And we saw her riding up to the gate, respected by the goblins as if she was their peer. If this bond truly means something to them — then we may have found the one thing goblins actually respect. And we can use it to obtain peace and prosperity.”<br><br>Her voice carried more weight now — not just authority, but vision.<br><br>“We’ve hidden behind these walls long enough. Over the years we have tried negotiating, begging… and still they take our girls. Still they burn our outposts. That ends now.” she tugged lightly at the reins, looking confident in her new role. “It’s time to write new rules.”<br><br>Merton hesitated, then stepped back in silence.<br><br>Professor Calwynn nodded once.<br><br>“Open the gates.”<br><br>The great wooden doors groaned louder this time, lurching outward on iron hinges.<br><br>They opened with a slow finality, and for a breathless moment, the light of sunset seemed blinding.<br><br>Lady Calwynn turned her head slightly toward Jade and Professor Ellinor on either side of her.<br><br>“Ready?”<br><br>Jade nodded.<br><br>Ellinor was already upright, expression cool and focused.<br><br>Lady Calwynn tapped her mount firmly with her spurs.<br><br>Dorian began to walk.<br><br>And behind them, the formation followed — a procession of mounted humans, solemn and proud, crossing the boundary of old fears.<br><br>Jade’s heart pounded.<br><br>Winnie shifted beneath her with practiced steadiness, her body still, her balance unwavering. But Jade’s palms — resting lightly on the reins — were damp. Her fingers flexed once, twice. She took a breath.<br><br>She was leading them into the open — mounted, exposed, visible from every angle. Her new followers. If she was wrong, they’d be butchered before they could turn back. A display of arrogance punished by death.<br><br>What if the goblins didn’t see the bond the way she thought?<br><br>Those fears stacked themselves like daggers in her spine. But Jade didn’t let them reach her face.<br><br>She couldn’t afford doubt.<br><br>Not now.<br><br>The formation behind her moved in practiced unison. The sound of boots on grass and stone, the subtle creak of saddles, the light jingling of buckles and spurs. Her creation — her gamble — was now a machine, alive and exposed under the eyes of their former enemy.<br><br>She glanced sideways.<br><br>Lady Calwynn was serene, unmoved. Dorian strode with dignity beneath her.<br><br>Ellinor sat like carved marble, her expression unreadable.<br><br>And before them, just a few dozen feet away, stood the goblin camp.<br><br>Winnie took another step. Then another. Her pace never changed. And Jade realized, with a sudden swell of pride and guilt and gratitude all at once: Winnie wasn’t afraid.<br><br>She believed in her.<br><br>She trusted her.<br><br>***<br><br>The goblin camp had settled into a low murmur: weapons were being oiled, fires were stoked for evening meals, and scouts reported in quiet bursts of gravel-voiced goblinspeak.<br><br>Inside the tent, the Chief of the besieging tribe — Grathun — sat cross-legged on a layered mat of stitched furs. He was built like a barrel, with weathered gray braids, a jaw tattooed with old tribal script, and a long knife resting across his knees.<br><br>With him sat Jade’s travel companions: Sena, Tarak, and Malgrin.<br><br>The initial tension between them had long since cooled, replaced with cautious respect. After all, Grathun had agreed to a pause in the siege, giving them a chance to follow their plan.<br><br>Grathun sipped from a carved horn of warm grog and exhaled.<br><br>“So,” he said, looking at Sena, “your girl seems to know what she’s doing. Are we really going to deal with ponygirls owned by humans?”<br><br>“It sounds like it, though I want to meet Jade’s fellow riders first. What is your concern?” Sena asked.<br><br>Grathun hesitated.<br><br>Then he said it aloud.<br><br>“Well, I have three of their girls in my pen… and you know what happens when someone steals a ponygirl…”<br><br>The tent fell quiet.<br><br>Even Tarak looked up now.<br><br>“It’s not a story we tell young ones just for fun,” Grathun went on. “Every time a goblin tries it — takes someone else’s ponygirl — he dies. Not in battle. Not from poison. Slowly. His skin rots. His teeth fall out. His guts turn to black ash.”<br><br>Tarak frowned. “That’s an old superstition.”<br><br>“Tell that to the bones of Chief Drughun,” Grathun muttered. “Or to Larra One-Eye. Or Murgak the Pale. All of them took mounts that were owned by others. All of them died in agony.”<br><br>Tarak raised an eyebrow. “But these are humans. Not goblins.”<br><br>Grathun looked at him. And didn’t blink. “Would you risk the curse?”<br><br>Malgrin shifted uncomfortably.<br><br>Sena leaned forward slightly. “I think the curse has nothing to do with species or races,” she muttered. “I think the key… is the sacred bond between a girl and her rider.”<br><br>Sena’s voice turned quiet, but sharp as flint as she continued. “Which means if we don’t honor it — even with humans — we invite the curse.”<br><br>She let the words hang in the smoky air.<br><br>Grathun didn’t reply. But he didn’t argue either.<br><br>The silence didn’t last long, as the flap of the tent was thrown open with urgency.<br><br>A young goblin officer ducked inside, breathless, eyes wide.<br><br>“Chief,” he said, voice taut, “you need to come. Now.”<br><br>Grathun scowled. “Is it the humans?”<br><br>The officer just nodded.<br><br>Sena, Tarak, and Malgrin were on their feet before Grathun rose, pushing aside his carved drinking horn. The Chief pulled on his heavy belt and knife, then swept through the tent flap into the fading light.<br><br>The western horizon was glowing amber — and across the field that stretched between the goblin encampment and the castle walls, a formation was approaching.<br><br>They moved in three rows: three in front, then five, then seven.<br><br>Each rider was seated tall, steady, and composed — and each mount moved beneath them with purpose, their bodies upright, their gait even and deliberate.<br><br>It was not the mounts that drew gasps from the watching goblins.<br><br>It was the riders.<br><br>Humans. Not goblins.<br><br>Human girls — and women, and one young man — mounted on human backs. The mounts were saddled, bridled, led by reins, spurs gleaming at their riders’ heels.<br><br>Grathun stepped forward, his jaw tightening.<br><br>“I’ll be damned…” he whispered to himself.<br><br>In the center of the front row rode three figures.<br><br>On the left, Professor Ellinor: severe, silver-braided, her whip held firmly at her side. Her mount — a broad-shouldered boy — looked uncomfortable under her curvy form, yet he moved with the focus of a soldier, his chest rising and falling with effort but never breaking rhythm.<br><br>On the right, Jade — mounted on Winnie, who carried her with the usual grace and devotion. The two of them radiated the practiced confidence of a veteran pair. The stirrups clipped to the rings on Winnie’s breasts swayed in time with her stride, jeeping Jade’s feet comfortable and supported. Winnie’s pierced face was calm. Owned. Proud.<br><br>And in the center…<br><br>Lady Calwynn.<br><br>She sat with aristocratic composure atop Dorian, the proudest of all the new mounts. His expression was taut, controlled, but the sweat on his back betrayed the work he had already done. The boy would probably have preferred a younger and lighter rider, but he was powerless beneath the headmistress’ authority. <br><br>Calwynn’s hands rested lightly on her reins. Her spurs flashed.<br><br>The silence among the goblins was thick.<br><br>Grathun stared.<br><br>Then Sena stepped up beside him, arms crossed.<br><br>“Well,” she said lightly, “I suppose you’d better start packing, Chief.”<br><br>He grunted. “What?”<br><br>She nodded toward the oncoming humans.<br><br>“Because you can’t touch any of those ponygirls now.”<br><br>Grathun looked at her sidelong.<br><br>Sena shrugged. “The curse only cares that they have been claimed.”<br><br>The entire formation came to a precise halt — twenty feet from the goblin line.<br><br>And in the rising hush of twilight, the world shifted.<br><br>Goblins stood still.<br><br>And watched a new kind of tribe assemble before them. Fifteen human riders sat astride their human mounts — fifteen declarations of a new order.<br><br>Jade kept her face still as she guided Winnie one last step forward, then she pulled the reins and turned slightly toward the goblins gathered near the camp perimeter. She found Sena’s face and nodded at her, then she gave a courteous smirk to chief Grathun.<br><br>She turned her head to the side, as if leaving the stage to the headmistress.<br><br>Lady Calwynn gave the slightest nod and guided Dorian forward with a sharp dig of her spurs, followed almost immediately by a firm pull of the reins. Her poise seemed untouched by the tension hanging between the two groups, as she rode her young mount with a total sense of entitlement.<br><br>The goblins shifted, murmuring among themselves.<br><br>Calwynn surveyed them like a queen addressing an unruly court.<br><br>Her voice rang out, firm and clear: “I speak as the leader of this human stronghold. I represent those within — and those outside — who have adopted the rightful order of things: that the strongest lead, and the devoted serve.”<br><br>She let the words settle.<br><br>“And therefore, I speak to you as one rider to another.”<br><br>She leaned forward slightly in the saddle, eyes narrowing.<br><br>“We have seen how your people take girls from our settlements. Break them. Use them. Own them.”<br><br>The goblins’ expressions were unreadable.<br><br>“We will not allow that any longer,” Calwynn continued. “Those girls you have taken — they are ours. Our students. Our kin. Our ponygirls.”<br><br>Gasps rippled from behind her. Even some of the human mounts stirred.<br><br>But Calwynn didn’t flinch.<br><br>“The three girls you captured had not been saddled yet,” she continued, “but they were already claimed. Trained. Prepared. You have stolen our livestock.”<br><br>Her eyes locked on the Chief.<br><br>Behind the goblin line, Sena’s mouth twitched into the faintest smile.<br><br>Lady Calwynn pressed on.<br><br>“I demand the immediate end of your siege. And I demand the release of our girls — unharmed — into our care.”<br><br>Grathun, the Chief, stepped forward.<br><br>His face was blank, and his knuckles whitened around the hilt of the blade at his hip.<br><br>He said nothing for several breaths.<br><br>Then, with slow calculation: “You have made your point. Our response will be ready shortly.”<br><br>He turned to Sena, to Tarak, to Malgrin. “You three. With me.” He didn’t look at the humans again as he stormed back toward his tent.<br><br>Inside the canvas shelter, the atmosphere was tight, thick with tension.<br><br>Grathun paced, the leather of his boots creaking with every step.<br><br>“She dares say we stole trained mounts?” he spat. “They weren’t even bridled!”<br><br>Tarak exhaled. “You know the stories, Chief. Everyone does. You take a bonded ponygirl from another rider and it follows you. Always.”<br><br>Grathun growled. “She’s using it against us. Twisting it.”<br><br>“I don’t think they even know about the curse,” Sena said evenly. “But she’s handling this well. The question is simple: are you willing to take the chance?”<br><br>Grathun sat heavily onto his fur-covered stool.<br><br>For a long moment, he said nothing. Then he spoke through gritted teeth: “Fine.”<br><br>The response from the goblins came by way of Sena, striding across the field toward the formation with that ever-measured step.<br><br>“The Chief accepts your terms,” she announced. “All captives will be released immediately.”<br><br>There was no cheer. No applause.<br><br>Only a long, breath-held silence.<br><br>Then Lady Calwynn gave the slightest nod.<br><br>Professor Ellinor blew a whistle, and three girls in clean equestrian uniforms walked out of the gates, holding a piece of rope each. They approached the pen, tied the rope around the necks of their fellow students that had been captured, and looked at the young goblin who was guarding it.<br><br>He lowered his head, and let them go.<br><br>Then the formation turned, row by row, and rode back toward the school followed by the six students on foot.<br><br>But beneath the practiced composure, excitement rippled like sparks under dry leaves. Their gamble had worked. Jade’s theory had held. The goblins had relented.<br><br>They passed through the open gates in dignified silence — all posture, discipline, and high control.<br><br>Then the gates creaked closed behind them.<br><br>And the tension burst.<br><br>Laughter broke out first — ragged and relieved.<br><br>Beth nearly fell off Marla, laughing and crying at once. Professor Ellinor exhaled like she’d been holding her breath for an hour. Even Lady Calwynn allowed herself a smile and a proud nod, staying mounted with an air of absolute authority.<br><br>Jade reached forward, stroking Winnie’s hair, barely able to keep the pride and relief from spilling into tears.<br><br>They had done it.<br><br>They…<br><br>A crack echoed through the courtyard.<br><br>A thud.<br><br>Then a scream.<br><br>Everyone turned.<br><br>At the far side of the courtyard, Martina had just intentionally slammed her back side into a wall. Her rider, Silas, still in the saddle, was gripping the reins and whipping her across the flank with vicious force.<br><br>Crack! Crack! Crack!<br><br>She roared in pain and rage, twisting under him, her spine straining against her cuffed wrists like a trapped beast.<br><br>“Get off me!” she screamed.<br><br>He yanked the reins tighter, trying to stay mounted, red-faced, panicked. “Obey! Obey me!”<br><br>Martina screamed again and threw herself backward into the wall a second time.<br><br>Thud.<br><br>He cried out as he slammed against stone, his legs slipping from the stirrups.<br><br>Then — finally — she bucked him free.<br><br>Silas tumbled hard to the ground with a grunt, rolling to his side.<br><br>Before anyone could reach them, Martina turned, bare legs shaking, and kicked.<br><br>Once in the ribs.<br><br>Again in the stomach.<br><br>Silas curled up with a scream, coughing, gasping.<br><br>Jade was already moving — but Professor Ellinor was closer.<br><br>She dismounted Galen and ran to Martina, grabbing her by the shoulder and pulling her back sharply.<br><br>“Enough!”<br><br>Martina resisted for a heartbeat — then crumpled, sobbing and shivering, against the professor’s arm.<br><br>Ellinor held her.<br><br>Silas groaned on the ground, bleeding from the lip, his shirt torn and smeared with dirt and red marks.<br><br>The courtyard had gone completely still.<br><br>Jade stood frozen, heart racing, the weight of the moment crashing down.<br><br>They had proven themselves to the goblins.<br><br>But inside their own walls — they still had so much to fix.`],
      8: ["Chapter 8", `Martina was still trembling — her body raw with exhaustion and shame — but she walked toward the headmistress’ office without protest, bare and bruised, flanked by professor Ellinor and Jade. <br><br>No harness or saddle. No restraints. Only a blanket covering her naked body, the weight of what had happened — and what needed to be reckoned with.<br><br>Calwynn's voice cut the silence.<br><br>“Explain.”<br><br>Martina looked up, blinking as if she'd barely heard the word.<br><br>Then she spoke.<br><br>“During the drills… he was always rough,” she said softly. “But I thought maybe he was just… overcompensating. Nervous. Trying to act confident. So I tried my best to endure.”<br><br>Jade’s jaw tightened.<br><br>“But then,” Martina continued, “after your speech, while we were waiting for the goblins to respond…”<br><br>She swallowed hard.<br><br>“…I couldn’t move. None of us could — not without breaking formation. And he knew that.”<br><br>The fire crackled, but no one spoke.<br><br>Martina’s hands curled at her sides.<br><br>“He pulled the reins tight. Not to steer. Just to restrain me. To make it clear I wasn’t allowed to move.”<br><br>Professor Ellinor’s eyes narrowed.<br><br>Martina’s voice faltered.<br><br>“And then he started digging in the spurs. Slowly. Repeatedly. Not to command — just to hurt.”<br><br>Her chest hitched.<br><br>“And he got… turned on by it. I could feel it.”<br><br>Calwynn’s hands dropped to her sides.<br><br>Martina's voice broke, but she forced the rest out.<br><br>“He was rubbing himself slowly against the saddle. Getting off on it. Using me for his sadistic enjoyment… Knowing I couldn’t do anything without exposing all of us.”<br><br>Silence.<br><br>Professor Ellinor exhaled slowly.<br><br>Lady Calwynn nodded once.<br><br>Her voice was colder than ice.<br><br>“We believe you, obviously. I am so sorry.”<br><br>Martina blinked.<br><br>Calwynn looked at Jade and the professor. “We will speak with him, and he will face consequences.”<br><br>She turned back to Martina.<br><br>“But you — you did not fail us. You held formation. You endured, and then you defended your dignity when you could. Thank you, Martina.”<br><br>Calwynn’s voice softened by a fraction.<br><br>“You protected what we are just starting to build. I am proud of you.”<br><br>Martina finally collapsed to her knees, head bowed — but not in shame. Only in the slow release of breath she’d been holding all day.<br><br>“We will find you a better assignment, I promise,” Lady Calwynn concluded, placing a hand on top of the kneeling girl’s head. “Now you can go to your room and get cleaned up.”<br><br>Then the headmistress left her chambers, striding through the corridors like a gathering storm — her boots snapping sharply on the stone floors, her cloak trailing behind her like a slash of judgment. She said nothing to the students who stepped aside, nothing to the guards who nodded as she passed.<br><br>Jade and Professor Ellinor followed close behind, silent but alert.<br><br>They reached the infirmary within minutes.<br><br>Calwynn pushed open the wooden door without knocking.<br><br>Inside, the air smelled of herbs and tinctures — and blood.<br><br>The nurse lay slumped in a chair beside one of the beds, her nose crooked and bleeding, a streak of red across her apron. A broken ceramic bowl lay shattered on the floor.<br><br>“Where is he?” Calwynn demanded.<br><br>The nurse groaned, dazed, trying to sit up.<br><br>“Gone,” she mumbled. “He struck me and ran. Right after I turned to mix a salve.”<br><br>Jade’s heart dropped.<br><br>The cot beside them was empty — the bandages left in a tangle, blood still fresh on the pillow.<br><br>Professor Ellinor knelt beside the nurse, checking her pulse and helping her upright.<br><br>Lady Calwynn stared at the empty bed, feeling that this was not the last time she was going to hear about Silas.<br><br>***<br><br>The air was cold and heavy with dew on the following morning when Lady Calwynn mounted Martina just outside the main doors of the school. The athletic girl shivered slightly under the weight of the headmistress, feeling her matronly thighs squeeze her rib cage as the weight settled in the saddle. <br><br>Nearby, Jade climbed onto Marla’s back, tightening the reins around her hands as the young girl straightened her back in anticipation.<br><br>No words were exchanged at first. Only the soft creak of leather and the rhythmic sound of boots on packed dirt as the two ponygirls carried their riders down the sloped path, past the outer gates and out into the open.<br><br>The goblin camp lay ahead, no more than a hundred meters beyond the tree line, now quiet and calm as the enemy tribe continued dismantling their siege. Smoke curled from a few dying fires, and rows of gear lay stacked and bound for travel. Goblins bustled about, loading wagons, and guiding their own mounts with curt, practiced gestures.<br><br>Lady Calwynn gave a quiet command, and Martina turned slightly. A moment later, the headmistress pressed her heels in, letting the spurs dig gently but deliberately into the girl’s flanks.<br><br>Martina flinched, then settled with a breath. Her shoulders dipped, her head lowered. She was learning to submit to a demanding but fair rider.<br><br>“A spooked mount should be saddled and ridden again as soon as possible,” Lady Calwynn remarked quietly, referring to the student beneath her. “But this is not punishment. This is purpose. I am so proud of her for enduring yesterday’s ordeal, and now she can witness what she helped us achieve: the goblins are getting ready to leave.”<br><br>Jade nodded. She gave Marla a firm squeeze with her own legs, the spurs tapping her gently at first—then firmer, a signal to correct her slightly drifting path.<br><br>Marla responded with a soft grunt and a renewed rhythm in her steps. Her back held strong under Jade’s weight.<br><br>“And this one… She can take more than Beth thinks,” Jade said. “But she needs a firm hand. A rider who believes she can bear it.”<br><br>They rode in silence for a while, letting their mounts feel the weight and consequence of the morning ride. Neither Martina nor Marla had spoken a word since leaving the school, of course. The bits in their mouths ensured silence, but their bodies spoke volumes—through posture, breath, and the occasional tensing of muscle as the spurs reminded them of their subservient role.<br><br>Even from their lower vantage, they had a clear view of the goblins preparing to leave. Ponygirls were being led in lines—some tethered, others dragging small sleds with bundles. The tribal flags had already come down.<br><br>“They’re really going,” Lady Calwynn said with quiet disbelief. “Yesterday, we were at war. Now...”<br><br>Jade adjusted the reins slightly. “Your speech, Martina’s restraint—how she endured—made all the difference.”<br><br>Lady Calwynn looked down at her mount with a faint nod. “She should be proud. I hope she knows that.”<br><br>Just then, Sena approached, guiding her own mount with ease. She wore a confident expression, but her brow was furrowed.<br><br>“Good morning,” she called. “I hoped I’d find you before the final wagons leave.”<br><br>Lady Calwynn halted Martina with the reins, and Jade brought Marla to a stop beside her.<br><br>Sena leaned forward in the saddle. “The Chief’s in a foul mood this morning. One of his ponygirls vanished last night, with her saddle and full tack. He’s convinced she was stolen.”<br><br>Jade straightened slightly. “We had nothing to do with that.”<br><br>“Absolutely,” Calwynn added firmly. “You can assure him of that.”<br><br>“I already did,” Sena said. “He accepted it. For now.” She hesitated, then gave Jade a warm smile. “It’s been an honor. I hope we will see each other again soon...”<br><br>Jade smiled faintly and reached across to clasp Sena’s arm. Their ponygirls stood close, sweat drying in the cool morning breeze.<br><br>“We certainly will. Safe travels,” Jade said.<br><br>Sena leaned in, embracing her briefly from the saddle—an awkward but heartfelt hug between two unlikely allies. Then she turned her mount and trotted back toward the goblin lines.<br><br>As she disappeared behind the trees, Jade exhaled slowly.<br><br>“She doesn’t know it was probably Silas,” she murmured.<br><br>Lady Calwynn’s eyes narrowed. “Yes, the little wimp wouldn’t go far without a mount.”<br><br>Jade looked down at the worn path ahead of them with a sad expression. “And now he has one: a girl who’s been completely broken by the goblins, whom he can abuse without consequence.”<br><br>The silence between them was heavy. Around them, the goblin camp slowly faded into the forest, wagons creaking, steps echoing softly.<br><br>Lady Calwynn gave a quiet sigh and adjusted her grip on the reins.<br><br>“Let’s return,” she said. “We’ll need to start preparing for what comes next.”<br><br>With a quiet tap of the spurs, the two ponygirls turned and began the climb back to the school, carrying Jade and the headmistress with increasing confidence.<br><br>They found Beth right where they had left her: doing drills in the courtyard, gaining confidence as she took her cousin Winnie through her paces.<br><br>"You are not finished until I see some fresh cuts and welts on my ponygirl's skin," Jade yelled at Beth with a wink.<br><br>***<br><br>Lady Calwynn stood beside a reading lectern, parchment in hand, her hair tied in a deliberate twist, her riding boots dusted from the early patrol.<br><br>Professor Ellinor leaned near the mantle, arms crossed, sharp eyes betraying both fatigue and attentiveness.<br><br>Jade sat tall and composed, one leg crossed. Her mount — Winnie — knelt on her hands and knees beneath her, bare and calm, acting as a human chair. Jade sat on her back sideways, one hand occasionally brushing Winnie’s hair in quiet gratitude.<br><br>This was not a display for show. Winnie had chosen to attend the meeting like this, and her eyes, though lowered, were alert — fully present.<br><br>Calwynn took a breath and started the meeting.<br><br>“We must face the truth. What happened yesterday didn’t just prove our theory about goblins respecting the bond between rider and mount — it revealed that the bond is sacrosanct in their eyes. To harm, steal, or even interfere with a claimed ponygirl is unthinkable to them.”<br><br>Jade nodded. “They even accepted our claim about the girls they had captured, which was a total bluff. I could tell that they were indecisive about it, but they decided not to risk. They must be scared of breaking some sacred rule about ponygirls.”<br><br>Professor Ellinor – who had carried a purse full of gold coins to purchase the girls in case the bluff had not worked – nodded and murmured, “It’s an incredible safeguard… if we embrace it fully.”<br><br>Calwynn turned back to the parchment in her hands. Her voice was crisp.<br><br>“I have drafted a preliminary framework. This will form the foundation for a school-wide policy, designed to protect our students while remaining voluntary and respectful.”<br><br>She cleared her throat.<br><br>1. Eligibility and Protection Mandate:<br><br>All physically fit female students above a minimum height threshold — based on goblin target profiles — are eligible and encouraged to enroll as ponygirls. They may choose either a limited training and service schedule (minimum four hours daily) or a full-time bond with a rider, depending on mutual agreement.<br><br>Jade glanced down briefly, stroking Winnie’s hair again. Most of those girls would probably not like the idea of becoming ponygirls. And unlike Winnie, some would probably never wholeheartedly embrace their role even after being trained.<br><br>But Jade knew that it was the only way to keep those girls safe.<br><br>2. Equal Representation of Ponyboys:
To maintain ethical parity, and to expand the pool of physically suitable riders, an equal number of male students will be recruited into the ponyboy program. Physical capability, temperament, and willingness will be assessed. No student will be forced — but the balance must be kept.<br><br>Ellinor nodded. “Smart. It allows both discipline and fairness. And it provides suitable mounts for heavier riders like myself.”<br><br>“I think the boys will be resentful of the mandatory quote, having to provide as many ponyboys as there are ponygirls,” Jade observed. “They might feel that they are paying an excessive price, just to protect their female peers. So I would let them know that males are also targeted by goblins, although less frequently. Our friend Cassian was taken with his mother, right in front of our eyes.”<br><br>“Great point, thanks Jade,” the headmistress said. “I will ask Professor Gilmore to prepare some informational material, so we can communicate to the student body that both boys and girls are in danger. We will also make sure all staff reinforce the point every time doubts are raised. Now, for the last point in my list…”<br><br>3. Rider Eligibility:
All riders will be female.<br><br>There was a pause.<br><br>Professor Ellinor’s brows lifted. “All?”<br><br>Calwynn didn’t flinch.<br><br>“Silas proved what happens when power is mishandled. Very few of our male students are physically suited to be riders in the first place — and the cultural expectation among goblins is clear: riders are to be obeyed. Unconditionally. That kind of power must go only to those who understand its weight.”<br><br>Ellinor was quiet for a beat. Then she said, “I’m not opposed. But we’ll have questions.”<br><br>“Good,” said Calwynn. “We’ll have answers.”<br><br>She turned to Jade. “I’d like your help refining this before it goes to faculty review.”<br><br>Jade looked up. “Of course.”<br><br>Beneath her, Winnie stayed still — but her cheeks were flushed with warmth. She had chosen this form of attendance not just as a gesture of devotion, but to be present for the shaping of a world where her position meant something real.<br><br>A role of dignity in subservience.<br><br>Calwynn lowered the parchment.<br><br>“This is how we survive and thrive,” she said. “Not by waiting to be taken. But by declaring ourselves — and making sure no one can mistake what we are.”<br><br>***<br><br>The final framework was announced on the following Monday.<br><br>And almost immediately, the campus felt different.<br><br>The halls were still lined with old stone arches, ivy creeping along the windows, the scent of chalk and ink lingering in the lecture rooms. But the atmosphere had shifted.<br><br>The new policy acknowledged that certain students faced a greater risk from goblin activity. And that bonding with a rider wasn’t just a symbolic act anymore. It was a shield. A declaration. A line no goblin would cross.<br><br>The reaction was immediate.<br><br>Petite women, once perhaps underestimated, now held a kind of soft power that no one had prepared for. For the first time, their stature — typically seen as a disadvantage in sport, in public speaking, even in politics — became a prized asset.<br><br>In common rooms and study halls, the taller girls and most boys — those who fit the goblin targeting profiles — began to take sudden interest in their smaller peers. It wasn’t subtle. Offers to “walk to class together” became daily occurrences. Shared meals became strategic. Study partnerships took on new meaning.<br><br>But most of all, there was one type of invitation that rose quietly above the rest: “Would you consider… being my rider?”<br><br>It wasn’t always romantic. But as soon as power became linked to proximity and trust, the line between protection and affection often blurred. For those already nursing friendships or romance, it was a natural shift. For others, it felt opportunistic — and not all were thrilled.<br><br>Some petite students thrived in their new roles — respected, pursued, and allowed to lead. Others felt unprepared and overwhelmed. Faculty stepped in where needed, offering workshops in rider etiquette and communication — because, as one professor reminded them: “To be offered a body to ride on is not just flattery. It’s an invitation to become someone’s shield.”<br><br>Even among the boys – who didn’t fear goblin raids as much – the shift was clear: a few volunteered early for the ponyboy program, eager to prove their loyalty and usefulness. Some sought riders. Others, not ready to submit, began to re-evaluate what strength would look like in this new society.<br><br>In every building, every whispered hallway conversation, the question hummed just below the surface: Who do you trust to ride you?<br><br>As the new bond system took root, it quickly grew more layered — and, in some corners of the campus, more ruthless.<br><br>What had started as a protective custom, then a romantic gesture, now edged toward a game of status and leverage.<br><br>Some students — especially the most sought-after petite women, now seen as prime rider candidates — began to curate their followers like an artist might curate a portfolio.<br><br>And many of them enjoyed the attention.<br><br>Girls like Sorrel, a third-year linguistics student with a soft voice and commanding poise, soon found herself pursued by no fewer than seven taller students of both genders. They followed her from class to class, carried her books, and fetched her lunch trays. One even got down on all fours during lectures so she could prop her feet up.<br><br>Sorrel didn’t reject anyone.<br><br>She evaluated.<br><br>Every offer became a performance. Who would kneel first? Who offered to carry her on their back across the rain-soaked courtyard? Who — blushing but sincere — leaned down during study hall and murmured, “May I clean your boots?”<br><br>Sometimes, she said yes. Sometimes, she smiled and moved on.<br><br>Around her, others began to do the same.<br><br>The rider class was forming — not officially, but perceptibly.<br><br>And with it came competition.<br><br>Among the aspiring mounts, there were whispers: She prefers someone who kisses her feet before she asks. Or, If you want a real chance, offer to carry her at least eight hours a day.<br><br>Some girls of average size were torn between becoming the riders of strong boys, or mounts for the most petite girls. Not all of them preferred the former.<br><br>Some professors raised concerns: that the partnerships, meant for mutual trust and protection, were turning into social currency.<br><br>But others — including Lady Calwynn — watched with measured interest.<br><br>“This was always going to happen,” she told Professor Ellinor during one faculty meeting. “Power gravitates. So does desire. The question is whether we give it structure or let it spiral.”<br><br>Calwynn knew: this was a glimpse of the future.<br><br>Where devotion was the new form of courtship.<br><br>***<br><br>Lady Calwynn offered Jade and Winnie a full scholarship, and with it the opportunity to achieve a level of education that had never been within their reach.<br><br>She allowed – and even encouraged – Jade to be openly dominant with Winnie on campus, setting an example for all of their peers.<br><br>It was a powerful role, not only because Winnie was deeply and eagerly subservient, but also because Jade had become some kind of hero at Elmsworth Academy: she was nicknamed the Goblin Whisperer, and largely credited for bringing peace and prosperity to the entire region thanks to her keen interest in goblin culture, which had led to the introduction of human pony riding in settlements far beyond the reach of the prestigious school.<br><br>Jade also became a trusted advisor to Lady Calwynn, and an effective assistant to the growing staff of equestrian teachers that prepared students for their lives as human ponies and riders.<br><br>Of course Jade never failed to involve Winnie in both of those roles.<br><br>Aspiring riders competed for the opportunity to experience a ride on Winnie, the first ponygirl of her kind. And a formal waiting list had to be introduced for the boys and girls who wanted to be handled by Jade on a training ride, even though she was known to be a dominant rider and to wear the sharpest spurs of the entire school.<br><br>***<br><br>Lady Calwynn also began organizing events in nearby towns, to spread the word on the new lifestyle that would protect their citizens from goblin raids, and of course to promote her school as the prime location where aspiring riders and mounts could be trained.<br><br>Jade and Winnie always rode with her on these outings, and often gave demonstrations.<br><br>It was on one of these trips that they finally experienced the joy of reuniting with Jade’s father Bertram, Winnie’s mother Emily, and Winnie’s siblings Archie and Olivia. <br><br>“We looked for you everywhere,” Jade said, tears in her eyes.<br><br>They explained that human soldiers had forcibly relocated them on that fateful day, refusing to wait for Jade and Winnie because the area was infested with belligerent goblins.<br><br>Olivia experienced a ride on her older sister Winnie, and loved every minute of it.<br><br>***<br><br>On a different trip – this time to a goblin settlement in the north – they also found Cassian and Mirabel. They were unmistakably owned by goblins now, and there was little Jade could do for them.<br><br>But they seemed relatively happy in their new roles.<br><br>Mirabel was too frail to make a good mount, so she had been made a groom in the local stables. She took excellent care of the ponygirls, and even looked after her adored son, who was the most sought-after bull in town.<br><br>Jade could feel the longing in Winnie’s gaze. She promised that they would find Cassian once it was time for her to be bred. <br><br>“You two will produce a new generation of strong beautiful ponygirls for me to ride when we get older…” she said with a dreaming voice.<br><br>***<br><br>Despite their growing engagements and responsibilities, Jade and Winnie’s personal dynamic only became more symbiotic over time. <br><br>Winnie willingly embraced her role as Jade’s property, finding purpose, pride, and profound fulfillment in submission and service. Her devotion to Jade was absolute, expressed not just physically—through obedience, endurance, and willingness to serve—but emotionally as well. Her submission was heartfelt, chosen freely, and reinforced through mutual trust.<br><br>Jade, in turn, grew into a confident and respectful dominant figure—her power tempered by care, responsibility, and genuine love. The experience of riding and controlling Winnie had allowed her to discover her own assertiveness and strength, but also her capacity for compassion, empathy, and leadership.<br><br>She might have been nicknamed the Goblin Whisperer.<br><br>But Jade’s favorite whispers were always the ones she gave her human ponygirl Winnie, while sitting in her saddle.<br><br><strong><i>THE END</i></strong>`]
