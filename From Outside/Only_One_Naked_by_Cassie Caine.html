                    title: "Part Ⅰ: Chapter 1",
                    subtitle: "MAISIE AND THE ARTISTS",
                    content: `“Do you have any books on the female nude?”<br>br>The speaker was a tall, striking girl with short blonde hair. Her ringing, confident tones seemed to reach into every corner of the bookshop.<br>br>Maisie blinked at her from behind her desk.<br>br>“Um ...” It was how she began every sentence: “Um.” But some “ums” she meant more than others. After a week, she still didn't know her way around her aunt's rather sprawling shop. Aunt Barbara had been very ill and was now convalescing in a gite in Normandy. Maisie had been drafted in as her temporary replacement.<br>br>She stood up, a slender, 22-year-old, medium height, with straight red hair, pale skin and large, soft eyes and mouth. Summer had gotten off to a broiling start, and there was no air-conditioning in the bookshop, so Maisie was dressed in a brief cotton frock that ended well above the knee and left her shoulders and back bare. Something about the way the girl had said “female nude” made her smooth the meagre garment down over her hips nervously.<br>br>“Um, maybe the fine art section? Or photography?”<br>br>Maisie led the way, still patting at her dress, which showed a lot of creamy thigh. The photography section was tucked away on a top shelf. Murmuring excuses to the other customers, Maisie manhandled her aunt's recalcitrant wooden stepladder into place.<br>br>Then she paused. Her frock only just covered her lovely round backside. What would happen if she mounted the steps? It would be dreadful if she accidentally showed her knickers. On the other hand, she was eager to be of help. Almost a year after graduating with a degree in English, she still hadn't settled on a proper job, and she was hoping Aunt Barbara might keep her on if she did well. With another tug at her dress, she climbed the steps.<br>br>By the time she was high enough to reach the photography books, her thighs were on a level with the blonde girl's face. The girl was standing close, watching curiously, apparently not at all bothered by the occasional glimpses of underwear she was most likely getting. On the contrary, Maisie had a feeling the girl was enjoying herself.<br>br>Brushing away these anxieties, Maisie read along the row of dusty spines, looking for suitable titles. She spotted one and had to reach on tiptoe for it.<br>br>While she was at full stretch, she heard the girl say:<br>br>“Mmm! This is up there with pole-dancing!”<br>br>Maisie was so startled, she almost lost her balance.<br>br>“As a workout,” the girl continued smoothly. “All this climbing and stretching. It must really tone you up.”<br>br>“Um, I suppose.” Maisie scuttled down the stepladder and handed over the book. She felt very hot, and not just because of her exertions. The girl had unsettled her.<br>br>“Oh yeah, this is very cool,” said the girl. “These are original Victorian nudes. And what I really like, the plates haven't been retouched.” Seeing that Maisie had no idea what she meant, she explained, “Photographers often painted out the offending parts.”<br>br>She turned the book around so Maisie could see. Maisie found herself looking at a pale, plump model from long ago with lots of frizzy hair on top and between her legs.<br>br>“Stunning bush,” said the girl loudly.<br>br>“Um ...” said Maisie.<br>br>The next week, she was back.<br>br>“Hi, remember me? I was wondering if you could put this flier in your window.”<br>br>She handed over a photocopied sheet. It was an ad for a female life model to work on Wednesday evenings at the university. Contact Nicole.<br>br>“Dunno if I mentioned, I teach life drawing at the uni. I agreed to run this extra evening class for a few of my students, but none of the regular models wants the gig. What a hassle.”<br>br>So the blonde, Nicole, was an artist. That explained a lot. And she taught life drawing. Maisie knew what life drawing was. It was where artists drew the naked human body.<br>br>She read through the advertisement again. Nowhere did the word 'nude' appear. Nor, for that matter, 'naked', 'starkers,' 'bare-arse', or any other synonyms that leapt to mind. “Just in case anyone asks, this is, er – the model will have to be – ?”<br>br>Maisie couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence.<br>br>Nicole didn't seem to hear. “You will put it in your window, yeah? It's really urgent. Don't forget.”<br>br>With that, she waved a brisk goodbye and hurried off. Maisie read the flier again. The model would definitely be nude for a life drawing class, she was sure of that. Maisie admired the way nudity wasn't explicitly mentioned. It was as though Nicole thought it was hardly worth bringing up. Yep, you'll have to strip naked for a bunch of strangers and parade around so they can see your bits. What of it? Besides, anyone phoning up in the hope of modelling in clothes would soon be browbeaten by Nicole into getting their kit off. Nicole, even on brief acquaintance, had that kind of overpowering personality.<br>br>Maisie tried to picture the sort of individual who would answer the ad. You would have to be a nudist. Or an exhibitionist. Or a masochist. A bit of a pervert anyway. The artists drawing you would know you were a perv, and so would Nicole. They'd look down on you even as they scrutinized your tender parts. Entertaining herself with these thoughts, Maisie succumbed to a warm, drowsy glow.<br>br>A few days later, Nicole reappeared, far from her usual buoyant self.<br>br>“Please, please, tell me you've had some inquiries.”<br>br>“About the flier? Sorry, no, not a sausage. Anyway, they would have phoned you, not talked to me. Why, haven't you heard anything?”<br>br>“Nothing. And the class is tonight.” She looked more furious than anxious.<br>br>“Couldn't one of the students model?”<br>br>Nicole conveyed with a pained expression that she didn't think much of that idea. Her students, Maisie guessed, were probably too wonderful and talented to demean themselves by modelling. As she stood there, scowling out of the window, Nicole looked so very beautiful, so sculpted and chiselled and blonde and perfect, Maisie was tempted to suggest that she should be the one on the podium. But she knew Nicole wouldn't like that idea either.<br>br>“Does the model have to be, um, nude? I wouldn't mind helping out if I could wear a bikini or something.”<br>br>Maisie blurted out the question, surprising herself. As soon as it was out there, she felt a blend of relief and pure, stark terror. She stared at Nicole anxiously, fully expecting the lean, athletic blonde to drag her from her chair and rush her to the studio there and then.<br>br>“In a bikini? No, don't worry, I'll find someone. Thanks!” Nicole began making her way to the door.<br>br>Experiencing a strange lurch in her stomach, Maisie jumped up from behind her desk. Catching up with Nicole at the gardening section, she whispered, “Maybe … what if I wore a thong and covered my breasts with my hands?”<br>br>“Wouldn't do,” said Nicole sadly. “Thongs look so cheap. They spoil the whole effect.”<br>br>“I couldn't go nude,” whispered Maisie. “I'd be embarrassed.”<br>br>“What for? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You'd only be displaying what nature's given you, and you'd be helping talented young artists. And I'm sure you'd enjoy it.”<br>br>What a hypocrite. Maisie could just picture Nicole's expression if someone asked her to go nude. Why am I even trying to help? she wondered. The last thing she wanted was to exhibit herself to a bunch of complete strangers. The idea filled her with dread. It made her sick to her stomach. It would be totally, utterly humiliating.<br>br>“Alright,” said Maisie, “no thong. I'll go nude.”<br>br>At seven that evening, Maisie walked along the high street of the small, pretty university town which would be her home for the next few months while she tended Aunt Barbara's shop. It was a gorgeous evening. Other girls were abroad, dressed, like her, in light summer frocks. But most of them, she guessed, were wearing underwear.<br>br>Maisie wasn't. Nicole had told her to remove all undergarments at least two hours before the session, so there would be no marks on her skin. It was a wise precaution. Maisie's skin was particularly fine and delicate. Now, the balmy twilit air was washing under her skirt, over her bare, shaven pussy, a constant reminder that she was almost naked now, and would be completely naked very soon.<br>br>Her shaven pussy … This was something that hadn't crossed her mind until an hour ago, and now she could scarcely think of anything else. Her pussy was completely bald. She liked it that way – usually. But now she was terrified of exposing it to view. If only there was some magical, hair-growing cream she could apply for an instant bush.<br>br>Still, it would probably be OK, so long as she pressed her knees together and kept a hand down there at all times … or would that look like she was, you know … oh, God.<br>br>Shaking with fear, Maisie entered the handsome sandstone building which housed the university art department. She followed Nicole's directions to the classroom.<br>br>It was a large, grimy space with a glazed office in one corner, a dais made of wooden boxes down one end and a confusion of easels at the other. Maisie felt a glimmer of relief. If she and the students were at opposite ends, it wouldn't be quite so intimidating. Maybe she could pose facing the wall, so all they would see was her back and bottom.<br>br>A couple of students were milling around. They were all girls. Maisie caught the eye of a tall, full-bodied girl who looked as if she knew things.<br>br>“Is Nicole here?”<br>br>“Office. Are you the model?”<br>br>With a blush, Maisie admitted she was.<br>br>The girl looked pleased, but said nothing. Instead, she pointed towards the wood and glass box in the corner, sending Maisie on her way.<br>br>“You're here. Sweet.” Nicole's manner was brisk and not especially friendly, as though their relationship had cooled into a professional one now Maisie had agreed to model. “I'm afraid the model's changing room is locked, so if you could find yourself a corner here ...”<br>br>She gesticulated vaguely towards a little wooden chair among the clutter of brushes, stubs of crayons and heaps of drawings. Maisie would have preferred somewhere private, but felt too fatigued with nerves to argue. She crossed to the chair and put down her bag, glancing apprehensively out of the window at the classroom, which now contained a dozen or so tall, noisy girls.<br>br>“Are all the artists girls?”<br>br>Nicole nodded. She seemed to find the question boring.<br>br>Maisie nodded back, waiting for Nicole to leave, so she could change. Then, realizing that the beautiful blonde intended to stay, she turned and slid the frock off her shoulders.<br>br>“You'll find they look at you all the time,” said Nicole as Maisie pulled on her robe. “Even between poses. All those beady eyes. Boring into your skin. Don't let it bother you. It's a good thing. Looking is their job.” She grinned. “That's a frisky little number.”<br>br>Maisie peered down at herself, worrying. Not wanting to get one of her better robes grubby, she'd grabbed this one, which she hardly ever wore. Now she saw there was a reason she hardly ever wore it. It was tiny. If she stood bolt upright, it just about covered her bum cheeks at the back and her pussy at the front. Once she was in motion, it wouldn't conceal much at all.<br>br>First, no pubic hair. Now, she didn't even have a decent robe. She began to feel overwhelmed.<br>br>“Nicole,” she begged, “you will go easy on me, won't you?”<br>br>Nicole's answer was to take her by the elbow and lead her outside, where the girls were talking loudly and clattering about with their easels. Maisie half-expected them to stop and stare. Instead, they carried on with what they were doing, determined to seem blasé about a near-naked female in their midst.<br>br>They walked over to the dais. “Can you help me drag these wooden boxes into the centre?”<br>br>For a moment, Maisie was surprised Nicole asked her rather than the students. Then she remembered that they were serious artists and probably above manual labour.<br>br>Each of the boxes had a handle – a hole in the side – about halfway down. Nicole crouched, seized a box and started shifting it. Maisie followed suit. As she pulled, she felt her robe riding up at the back, and saw the tall, voluptuous student watching with interest.<br>br>By the time she'd manoeuvred the heavy box to the centre of the room, her robe had almost come undone and she had to tighten the belt. Her exploits had caught the attention of everyone except Nicole, who was wrestling with her second box.<br>br>Once all four boxes were in the centre, Nicole pushed them together to form a new dais. She told the students to arrange their easels in a circle around it.<br>br>Maisie was struck with fear. This new arrangement meant there would be no place to hide. No corner to shield her sensitive bald pussy from the inquiring eyes of Nicole's talented artists. All those beady eyes, boring into your skin. Nicole was obviously determined to throw her in at the deep end.<br>br>But just as quickly, the fear, the questions, gave way to resignation. She'd already accepted that her tits and arse would be on view this evening. The world wouldn't end if they saw her pussy as well.<br>br>The students were ready and waiting. Nicole held out her hand for Maisie's robe. With a shallow, faltering breath, Maisie unfastened the belt and let Nicole pull the robe from her milky, trembling shoulders. She was naked. All of her. Her small breasts with their pale pink nipples. Her soft white stomach, her slender hips and thighs, the neat tuck of her pussy, that was growing moist and rosy as she stood there, hesitating.<br>br>Feeling sick and excited at the same time, she squeezed between the easels. She had to take a big step up onto the dais; it gave the people behind, she was sure, a nice rear view of her pussy and little pink arsehole. Then she stood in the middle of the circle, feeling dizzy. The students' eyes were all over her, looking wherever they wanted, unapologetically. By stepping up on the dais, she had become their property.<br>br>“This is Maisie's first time, so make the most of her while she's fresh. Now, which of you would like to direct the short poses? You, Clarissa?”<br>br>The arm of the full-bodied girl had shot up like a rocket. Oh no, thought Maisie. Not her. Please not her. I don't like the way she looks at me. In fact, she didn't like the idea of any of the students directing the poses. Following Nicole's instructions was one thing. She was an adult, a professional, Maisie's age or older. She was so beautiful as well, not that that had anything to do with it. These students were younger than Maisie. It would be humiliating to be bossed around by them. She managed to keep her reaction off her face, but a nervous flutter ran up her tummy for all to see.<br>br>Hurrying onto the dais, Clarissa loomed domineeringly. She was over six feet tall and big in proportion, with double D breasts and a round face with china doll features. Although Maisie wasn't especially short, she felt like a child next to her. Every inch of Clarissa's ample body was covered by her long-sleeved sweater and jeans. That only made Maisie feel even more naked.<br>br>“I hope you're up for some dynamic poses.”<br>br>Dynamic poses? thought Maisie in dismay. I don't like the sound of those. Her reservations were justified. A dynamic pose, she quickly learnt, meant one where her legs were open.<br>br>Clarissa got Maisie to put one foot on the rung of a grubby, paint-flecked stool, then twist away, looking off over her shoulder, like someone who had been distracted from tying her shoelace by the sight of a ship on the horizon. The pose made Maisie's breasts go pert and upright. It lifted her pussy into view, prising the swelling outer lips apart for a glimpse of sugary inner folds.<br>br>Satisfied, Clarissa hopped down to her easel and started sketching. Standing there in her absurd pose, Maisie felt small, exposed, humiliated and, after a few minutes, in actual pain. She had cramps in her foot, her knee, her back and her poor little rump. Apparently another definition of a dynamic pose was one that crippled you after five minutes. I bet Clarissa wears out models by the dozen, she thought pitifully.<br>br>The next pose had her on her knees, leaning forward on her elbows, as though she were reading a magazine spread out on the floor. She stared light-headed at the flaky surface of the dais. At least this way she didn't have to see the dozen young faces studying her. That was something to be grateful for. But the pose exposed her even more than before, pulling apart the cheeks of her backside and revealing the delicate swirl of her anus.<br>br>The worst thing was, she could feel it puckering under the attention, sighing open like a rosebud awakened by the sun. It was bad enough that they could see every inch of her skin. Now her treacherous little hole was dilating, as though it wanted everyone to get a peek inside her body.<br>br>What did it mean? God, was she enjoying this? Getting off on the humiliation and the exposure? Did she like the idea of being the toy of twelve other girls who were younger and smarter than her and all fully dressed? Did it secretly thrill her to know the beautiful Nicole was watching? Was that why there was this moist, warm feeling rising up from her pussy all the way to her throat? Was that why her nipples were as hard and painful as thorns? Did it excite her to be the only one naked?<br>br>By the time Nicole called a break, Maisie's legs were shaking. Her mind felt like cotton wool and her robe was nowhere to be seen. Dizzily, she stumbled off the dais, straight into Clarissa.<br>br>“I'd love to know what you think of my sketches.”<br>br>Clarissa steered Maisie towards an easel. Feeling swamped by the big girl, Maisie stood with her breasts practically pressed against the propped-up drawing pad. Clarissa was right behind, one of her broad knees resting lightly against the cleft of Maisie's bottom. By now, Maisie was certain Clarissa's interest in her was more than just artistic, but she was too physically and emotionally done in to even think about extricating herself.<br>br>The pad was closed. When Clarissa opened it, the card cover rasped against Maisie's still-erect nipples, making her shiver. She shivered against when she saw Clarissa's drawing of her arse.<br>br>Yes, her round bottom, drawn straight on, the cheeks taut and lifted apart and the little anus in the middle, looking very dark and open, like a keyhole on the inner Maisie. Gosh, had her arsehole really puckered like that? She blushed all over and felt her heart racing and her breath growing heavy. And Clarissa had seen it. Recorded it with her pencil. She hadn't missed a thing.<br>br>“What do you think?” The knee gave her bottom a slight nudge.<br>br>“Um … it's very … thorough ...”<br>br>“Everyone says that.” Her tone implied that Maisie had just made one of the most boring, obvious remarks imaginable. “It's not about thoroughness or exactness. I want to capture the female form in tension.”<br>br>The knee pressed on Maisie's backside again, more sharply this time. She's certainly got my female form in tension, Maisie thought helplessly.<br>br>“Clarissa, let the poor girl put her robe on.” Nicole was standing there, brisk and smiling, Maisie's robe over her arm.<br>br>“Oh, is she naked?” said Clarissa airily. “I didn't notice.”<br>br>She closed the pad, catching Maisie's nipples once again, then sauntered off.<br>br>“What a thrill,” sighed Nicole, “working with such talented young artists. We're so privileged, don't you think?”<br>br>Maisie agreed with a faltering smile and put out her hand hopefully for her robe.<br>br>“I must admit I was ever so scared, but it went alright, didn't it?”<br>br>“You were good.”<br>br>“That long pose, though, I found the extended arm really hard to hold ...”<br>br>“Hmm, yes.”<br>br>Maisie was chattering nervously in Nicole's Mini. At the end of the session, Nicole had invited her home for a drink. After two hours of being naked, alcohol had seemed like just the ticket. Now Maisie was wondering whether she should have accepted after all.<br>br>Still keyed up and stunned by what she had done, Maisie needed to talk. But Nicole wasn't making any attempt to keep up her end of the conversation. Not the first time, Maisie got the impression Nicole wasn't very interested in anything Maisie had to say.<br>br>Maisie lapsed into silence. Although she was now dressed in her frock and some panties she'd had in her bag, her skin tingled in a way that made her still feel naked. Just the sensation of her thighs rubbing against each other gave her what was almost a mild electric shock.<br>br>She was struggling to come to terms with the truth. If she was honest, she had enjoyed herself. More than that. She had gotten off on her little adventure. And it wasn't about being naked. It was about being the only one naked. That was what had excited her. Not one of those other girls had shown an inch of skin, and she, older than them by a couple of years, had shown everything. God, how sick, to be turned on by something like that. She really was a despicable worm, wasn't she?<br>br>Never mind. She wouldn't let it happen again.<br>br>She glanced at her svelte blonde companion. It was weird that Nicole wouldn't speak. Unsettling. She'd chatted away to the students happily enough. It was as though Maisie was good for some things, for being naked and for doing what she was told, but wasn't worth talking to. But then why, she wondered, is she taking me home for drinks?<br>br>They pulled to a stop outside a pretty mews house on the edge of the historic town centre. To Maisie's surprise, the lights were on. Strange, incoherent music rumbled. Someone was home.<br>br>“Come and meet hubby,” said Nicole.<br>br>The front door opened directly onto a small sitting room. There were bright rugs and throws, richly-hued paintings on the walls and some kind of weird, hyperactive jazz coming from an expensive-looking iPod docking station. Sitting among all this colour and noise were two men and two women, arguing at the tops of their voices. A man with glasses, a woman with a henna perm, a woman with cropped hair and a young man with the improbable good looks of a fantasy gigolo.<br>br>Nicole pointed at the gigolo. “That's Manu.”<br>br>Manu acknowledged Nicole with a kiss and went back to arguing. He didn't acknowledge Maisie, nor did the rest of the quartet. Nicole dropped into the one free chair, leaving Maisie to sink awkwardly to her knees on the Kilim rug beside her.<br>br>After a minute a glass of red wine found its way to her. She sipped it in silent confusion. Nicole hadn't mentioned a husband, or told her to expect a houseful of guests. She seemed to delight in wrong-footing Maisie. Oh well. The one compensation was that Manu was ever so handsome. He had a booming, thickly accented voice, a deep chest, big arms, sideburns that swooped down like sabres in front of his ears and eyes that glittered intensely under shapely brows.<br>br>She wished she knew what they were talking about. The conversation seemed to be taking place in two or three different languages. Nicole astonished her by leaning forward and jabbering fluently in a foreign tongue. It didn't help that one word in three was masked by the raucous jazz, which showed no sign of ending or even changing tempo.<br>br>After a while, she gathered they were debating the merits of a famous artist whose name might have been something like Ratzskywatzsky. The man with glasses and the woman with the henna perm maintained that Ratzskywatzsky was a genius, while Manu was violently opposed and Nicole and the woman with cropped hair were somewhere in between.<br>br>A large book of Ratzskywatzky's paintings was being passed from hand to hand as each one made their case.<br>br>Manu prodded a glossy illustration. “You're all blind! Look at this shit! How can you call this man a visionary when he can't even paint the small of a girl's back without fucking it up?”<br>br>“There's nothing wrong with that back,” protested the man in glasses. “It's a lovely back.”<br>br>“It isn't real. Girl's backs don't look like that.”<br>br>“And Ingres painted in too many vertebrae. Who cares? It's about the very idea of suppleness.”<br>br>“Fuck that! I want anatomical accuracy.”<br>br>“I think it is anatomically accurate,” said the woman with cropped hair. “Who says it isn't?”<br>br>Spreading the book out on the coffee table between them, the four began to argue about a rather splodgy painting of a nude female back. Maisie watched in bemusement.<br>br>Nicole held up her hand. “All this arguing is pointless. We need to compare it to the real thing.”<br>br>This statement in itself provoked more debate, but Nicole signalled everyone to be quiet. Then she turned to Maisie.<br>br>Maisie hoped she wasn't going to be asked what she thought of Ratzkywatzky.<br>br>“Maisie, get up and show us the small of your back.”<br>br>Maisie blinked. She wasn't sure if she had heard right, or what exactly it was Nicole wanted her to do. Nicole took the glass from her hand and waited. Dubiously, Maisie climbed to her feet and turned to face the wall.<br>br>“You'll need to take that dress off,” said Nicole.<br>br>On any other day of her life, Maisie would have found this statement extraordinary. But after posing naked for Nicole's class and being forced into all kinds of compromising positions by Clarissa, taking off her frock so a bunch of strangers could examine the small of her back seemed like the least she could do. After all, they were artists too, she supposed, or at any rate artistic types. And it would make up for the fact that she wasn't contributing much to the conversation.<br>br>Behind her, everyone waited in silence. Even the jazz lurched to an abrupt stop, only to start up again, with a raunchier tune. Maisie took that as her cue to step out of her little frock and bundle it against her chest.<br>br>To her horror, and then to her amusement, they all leapt up from their places. While the man with glasses held the book open next to her, they began comparing the anatomy of her lower back to that of the girl in the illustration. There was lots of dimple-counting, measuring of proportions and good-natured swearing. Maisie forgot her embarrassment and found herself smirking at the ridiculousness of it.<br>br>Nicole noticed and leaned forward confidentially. Maisie smiled, anticipating a joke.<br>br>“Go on upstairs.”<br>br>Maisie blushed. Her eyes blazed with indignation. Go on upstairs! Who did Nicole think she was, talking to her like that? Treating her like a servant. A pet. Not even, go on upstairs, please …<br>br>This moment of rebellion didn't register on Nicole, who was beckoning everyone else back to their seats and skilfully changing the topic of conversation. Maisie was on the sidelines again, forgotten. She suddenly felt silly, standing there in her underpants with her dress clutched to her chest.<br>br>She stared at Nicole for a moment, then dropped her eyes and padded meekly upstairs. Manu glanced briefly in her direction, but no one seemed curious about where she was going.<br>br>The little house had just the one bedroom. Without switching on the lights, she sat down on the edge of the bed.<br>br>Her cotton frock was still squashed against her small, firm breasts. She wondered if she should put it on again, without actually doing so. She seemed to have lost all power of independent decision-making. Presumably Nicole would sit downstairs having a nice long chat with her friends. Then, when she was good and ready, she would come upstairs and do whatever she wanted with Maisie. And the other four would know that Nicole treated Maisie like a slave.<br>br>Of course, Maisie didn't have to stand for any of it. She could put on her frock and go. It was only a short walk back to Aunt Barbara's house. But the truth was, she was curious, even anxious, to see what Nicole had planned for her next. At the same time, all this nudity and sexiness had left her feeling frayed and exhausted. Overwrought, she began to sob … gently and more or less silently, apart from the occasional sniff.<br>br>“Poor little thing. Are you sitting here in the dark, crying? How tragic.”<br>br>Nicole stood framed in the doorway. She set down a wine bottle and two glasses on a dresser, and went about turning on lamps until the room was bathed in pools of warm, gentle light.<br>br>“Come here, my weepy little gingernut.”<br>br>Taking Maisie by the hand, she drew her across the room to a full-length cheval mirror. Standing just behind her, she eased the frock from between Maisie's arms and tossed it onto a chair. Through eyes that were still blurry with tears, Maisie saw two beautiful girls in the glass. The taller, more confident, more striking one had all her clothes on. The other girl was naked apart from a little pair of panties. The lamplight sculpted this one's bare white flesh into delicious, succulent curves.<br>br>Nicole wrapped her strong arms around Maisie from behind and rested her sharp chin on Maisie's shoulder.<br>br>“You really like this, don't you? Showing off for me? It turns you on, getting out your little titties?”<br>br>Maisie made a throaty gulping noise which might have been a yes.<br>br>“Wanna show me your little white backside too?”<br>br>Still crying, Maisie nodded. Nicole made her turn around. With her back to the mirror and looking over her shoulder, Maisie slowly eased the panties down off her bottom.<br>br>“Ooooh, look at that full moon. This must be making you so wet,” Nicole whispered, “the silky feeling of sliding your panties down your lovely smooth backside … you love pushing those panties down. You want those pretty white cheeks on display ...”<br>br>Nicole was right. It was. She did. So much so, she could hardly breathe. Heart rate accelerating wildly, Maisie eased the panties the rest of the way down. Her bottom looked meltingly good in the mirror, a tasty dessert waiting for someone to take a scoop out of it. Certainly that was the reaction she read in the gorgeous Nicole's eyes.<br>br>The panties hung for a moment around her knees. Then they were around her ankles. She stepped out of them.<br>br>Nicole took Maisie's face in her hands and studied it. “Pretty tears … Yum ...”<br>br>She put out her tongue and ran it over Maisie's face. Then she frowned and said, “Stick out your tongue, too! You don't get to keep a single thing from me.”<br>br>Maisie poked out her slender little tongue. Nicole's tongue fluttered and lapped against it. Meanwhile, her hands explored Maisie's body at will. Plucking at her nipples. Sliding between the soft, sensitive cheeks of her arse …<br>br>Growing excited, Maisie tried to slip her hand under Nicole's T-shirt, but Nicole pushed it away. Maisie understood. She wasn't allowed to do anything. She was a passive object for Nicole's pleasure.<br>br>They were still standing in front of the mirror.<br>br>“Show the mirror your pussy! I want to see your beautiful pussy in my beautiful mirror.”<br>br>Nicole spun Maisie round and guided her hands down between her legs. Bracing her pelvis, Maisie splayed her pussy as far as it would go, revealing its shiny pink walls. Nicole studied it with a tigerish look and bit her neck.<br>br>“I love your pussy,” Nicole growled, “can I have it? I want to have it. I want to own it.”<br>br>It took a moment for Maisie to find her voice. She said simply, “It's yours.”<br>br>“Good girl … get up against that mirror.”<br>br>A hand gripped Maisie's neck, shoving her forward, squashing her against the cold glass. Face in profile, breasts flattened, Maisie clung to the mirror for support. Fingers pinched her neck.<br>br>“Stick your tongue out. Lick your reflection. Lick the fucking mirror.”<br>br>Maisie couldn't see what she was doing and didn't really understand. But it gave her a deep jolt of pleasure, like a landslide in her stomach, every time she obeyed Nicole's commands. She thrust out her tongue and wiggled it against the glass.<br>br>“Gorgeous! That's a pretty tongue! Can I have it?”<br>br>“Uh-huh.”<br>br>“Keep licking. You're gonna be in so much trouble if you stop. Now work your hips. Hump that cute redhead in the mirror. Hump her with your wet, sticky pussy.”<br>br>Still flapping her tongue, Milly slapped her hips against the mirror. Nicole's words had such power over her now, she almost believed there actually was another girl in the mirror and she was giving her the fuck of her life.<br>br>The hand released her neck. She felt strong fingers gripping her hips and buttocks – mauling them almost. Nicole was kneeling behind her. Lifting Maisie off her toes as she sought to plant her tongue into her pussy from the rear.<br>br>Each time the stiff long tongue lanced her, Maisie felt a moment of incandescent ecstasy. At the same time her little titties and her flushed face were being ground against the mirror as the powerful blonde bucked her about …<br>br>Suddenly Nicole grabbed her by the knees and lifted. She planted Maisie's shins on her shoulders. Back arched, bottom in the air, Maisie clung on, while Nicole's tongue flickered across her pussy like a series of miniature lightning bolts.<br>br>“After I've done your pussy,” Nicole explained, “I'm going to fuck you in the arse with my tongue.”<br>br>Downstairs, the discussion went on.<br>br>Later, they lay in bed, Maisie naked and exhausted and Nicole in bra and panties.<br>br>Nicole cradled the drained girl in her arms.<br>br>“Maisie ...”<br>br>“Yes, Nicole?”<br>br>“Remember that book I bought off you? The one about female nudes?”<br>br>Maisie sighed contentedly. How could she forget? If it weren't for that book, she would never have met Nicole or discovered her fondness for being the only one naked.<br>br>“Of course I remember,” she murmured.<br>br>“Oh good. It's just … a couple of the pages are missing. Would it be okay if I returned it?”`

                    title: "Part Ⅰ: Chapter 2", 
                    subtitle: "MAISIE AND THE OLDIES",
                    content: `“Maisie?”<br><br>“Yes, Mr. Wilson?”<br><br>“I wonder if you'd be kind enough to reach something down from the top shelf for me.”<br><br>“Of course.”<br><br>Maisie rose from her chair and, straightening the hem of her dainty summer frock, advanced towards the stepladder on slender legs. There was the slightest bounce of anticipation in her straight, shoulder-length red hair. They had the shop to themselves.<br><br>Mr. Wilson was one of Aunt Barbara's regular customers. He was in his early sixties, but tall, ruggedly handsome and well-turned out, with dark wavy locks, thick, expressive eyebrows and a wardrobe of immaculate blazers, cravats and twills. His natural haunt was the military memoirs section in the centre aisle.<br><br>He had been there the week before last, when Maisie climbed the stepladder for Nicole. It had apparently caught his attention, because he'd been back almost every day since. The first time, it was rainy and he found Maisie bundled in a long, sloppy sweater. He slunk off again almost immediately. Touched by his look of disappointment, she made it up to him the following day by squeezing into a pair of brief, clingy shorts.<br><br>So their game began. For over a week now, he had been buying lots of books and she had been climbing lots of stepladders.<br><br>Why was she doing it? At first, Mr. Wilson's combination of old world charm and Peeping Tom tendencies was a bit of a joke. But things changed after Nicole's art class. Maisie found herself in the grip of strong, scary impulses. Even though she dreaded it and it made her feel sick, she couldn't stop thinking about being naked. When she was walking along a crowded pavement, she would imagine what it would be like if she were in the nude, her bare skin brushing against all those bustling, clothed bodies. She would select a stranger from the crowd and picture him stopping her and ordering her to undress. She moved about in a state of constant arousal that brought her to the brink of tears.<br><br>In these circumstances, the game provided some much-needed relief. It was titillating, but safe. As he was so old and dignified, she trusted Mr. Wilson not to take it too far. And she had a feeling that by doing this, she would stop herself from doing something much more stupid.<br><br>“Where is it, Mr. Wilson?”<br><br>“Up there on the left … see that big encyclopedia of famous battles?”<br><br>“I'm sorry all our books are so out of the way.”<br><br>He waved away her apology with gentlemanly good manners. Maisie unfolded the stepladder and propelled her slim body up it, swinging her hips rather more than was necessary. As she climbed higher and reached for the encyclopedia, Mr. Wilson was able to see under her short, flaring skirt.<br><br>She hoped he liked her knickers. They were a favourite pair, pink floral lace. She could feel that they had settled into the cleft of her behind, leaving the lower part of each cheek exposed for his pleasure.<br><br>She paused halfway through pulling the encyclopedia off the shelf. The pose felt sexy and pert and she wanted him to have time to enjoy it. She pretended to read the name of the book squeezed in next to the encyclopedia. This left Mr. Wilson free to devour her with his eyes. Without looking down, she said, “You must be awfully knowledgeable by now, Mr. Wilson, reading all these books.”<br><br>“You would think so, wouldn't you? But I'm not what you would call a serious historian. Besides, book knowledge isn't everything.”<br><br>“That's true. Experience is important too, isn't it?”<br><br>“Well, I've got more than my fair share of that,” he laughed. “I've knocked about a bit, believe you me.”<br><br>“I haven't,” she said sadly.<br><br>“No, I can tell. You're a fresh as a spring flower.”<br><br>There was a tremor in his voice. Smirking to herself, Maisie hauled the encyclopedia into her arms. It was far bigger and heavier than she had realized. Making her way down the stepladder, she overbalanced.<br><br>Mr. Wilson was there in a flash, planting his hands on her waist. And just for a moment, before she steadied herself, the front of his trousers was under her skirt, touching her behind.<br><br>Immediately, her head blazed with lurid images. She saw Mr. Wilson reaching into his neatly-pressed trousers and pulling out a cock as shiny as a toffee apple. She pictured him pressing the toffee apple into her mouth, then pulling down the back of her lace panties to rub it against her eager bottom. She shook her head, dizzily.<br><br>“Whoops-a-daisy,” he said.<br><br>“Thanks, Mr. Wilson! I'm really ever so sorry! How clumsy of me!”<br><br>“I do hope you didn't sprain anything?” He was holding her tenderly by the elbow.<br><br>Maisie was completely fine. But she took the hint and sat back on the stepladder to rub one of her ankles, frowning.<br><br>He lifted the suspect ankle and squeezed it with his thumbs, looking along the expanse of her bare leg as he did so.<br><br>“I'm no sawbones, but I'd say this is a fine, healthy limb.” Mr. Wilson smiled at her, then cleared his throat. “Actually, while I've got you here, captive as it were, I was wondering if I could ask the most enormous favour?”<br><br>Get on your knees, you ginger tart, she imagined him saying.<br><br>“I'm having a small party this Saturday. Just a few old friends. Drinks and snacks. I'd very much like you to come.”<br><br>Maisie jerked her foot away and stood up. She couldn't have been any more astonished if he'd put his hand up her panties.<br><br>That was that. He'd ruined their private game. Trashed the delicate fantasy world they had erected. Let in … reality.<br><br>A few old friends. She could picture it. Cardigans, white hair, blood pressure pills, conversation full of such electrifying topics as pensions, osteoporosis and ballroom dancing. Pass the loaded pistol to the left.<br><br>“That's ever so sweet of you, Mr. Wilson, but I'm busy on Saturday.”<br><br>She thrust the encyclopedia at him.<br><br>Bang goes my sexy bookseller routine, she thought once she had returned to her desk. She began writing prices in a stack of paperbacks. Her sharp pencil inflicted deep gouges. It's all his fault. He broke the rules, silly old fart.<br><br>“What a shame,” said Mr Wilson, following her. “Are you sure you can't squeeze us in? It would only be for the first part of the evening. We pack it in early, we oldies. You could go on to your other date afterwards.” He frowned at her, cutting in before she could refuse. “Look, Maisie, let me be frank. I might have … well, I did … sort of boast about you to a couple of my friends. Nothing indiscreet,” he added hastily, “just how I'd met this most fascinating and unusual young girl. Everyone's dying to meet you. Now, if you don't show up, they'll think you're a figment of my imagination. You don't want everyone to think I've gone completely gaga, do you? You wouldn't want your best customer consigned to the loony bin?”<br><br>Fascinating and unusual? She couldn't stop a smile from playing around the corners of her lips.<br><br>“Maybe I could drop by for a few minutes.”<br><br>“Smashing,” he beamed. “I'm sure I can trust you to wear something that will knock their socks off.”<br><br>“I'm sure.”<br><br>“Here.” He handed her the encyclopedia. “You can put this back.”<br><br>That Saturday, Maisie stepped out of a taxi and walked up a cobbled garden path, between overflowing baskets of geraniums and pansies, to the door of Mr. Wilson's bijou cottage, which stood in one of the oldest parts of town almost in the shadow of the Medieval abbey.<br><br>It was a wonderful summer's evening, warm and still. Remembering Mr. Wilson's words and encouraged by the weather, she had decided to give everyone a cheap thrill by wearing a g-string and no bra under a short backless dress of turquoise chiffon with thin shoulder-straps. It was a nice dress, but you had to be careful where you stood as the flimsy material was see-through in certain lights. Her plan was to make a brief appearance, look pretty and then go.<br><br>Mr. Wilson was delighted.<br><br>“Hello, Maisie. My, you do look ravishing.” He stepped aside to let her in, then placed a hand on her bare back to guide her towards a tall, thin, smiling woman with lots of wavy auburn hair. She was very elegant and in her early fifties. “I'd like you to meet my wife.”<br><br>He didn't mention her Christian name, so Maisie said, “Hello, Mrs. Wilson.”<br><br>“Maisie, lovely to meet you at last. You're even prettier than I'd imagined.”<br><br>It was oddly disconcerting, the thought of Mrs. Wilson imagining her, but Maisie smiled her thanks.<br><br>Mrs. Wilson's hand joined Mr. Wilson's on Maisie's back, and all three moved into the lounge. It was a surprisingly spacious room with French windows opening onto a walled garden full of evening sun. Two other couples were enjoying drinks. Colin and Shirley were smiling, bashful, and a little overweight. Roger and Maddy were noisy and silly. They were all in their early to middle fifties.<br><br>“Now we're all here ...” said Roger. He stood up and thrust a small, brightly-coloured parcel towards Derek. “Happy birthday, old man. We clubbed together to get you something no relic your age should be without.”<br><br>It turned out to be some kind of gizmo for measuring blood pressure. Everyone laughed. Maisie joined in faintly. Even though the gift was supposed to be ironic and there was no way she could have known that it was Mr. Wilson's birthday, she felt embarrassed to have arrived empty-handed. Especially as she was planning on leaving early too.<br><br>Mrs. Wilson called everyone into the garden. Maisie's eyes lit up. There was champagne and a table of exquisite canapés. Soon she was happily licking caviare off her fingers and half-listening to Roger, who was a fount of scandalous anecdotes and racing tips. The abbey's steeple towered overhead, spreading a restful air over the pretty garden with its orderly flower-beds and mature shrubs. Blackbirds sang, and scattered gracefully every time another champagne cork popped. She forgot all about going.<br><br>Eventually, Mrs. Wilson decided some music would be nice, and they drifted back into the lounge, even though the sun still shone outside and the blackbirds sang sweetly. After some debate, she selected a CD of film and TV soundtracks which meant nothing to Maisie but which were apparently old favourites. The scores were lush and lively, mixing strings, drums and electric instruments.<br><br>“Derek, why don't you show everyone what I got you?”<br><br>A moment later, Mr Wilson returned, brandishing a new, high-end digital camera.<br><br>“It's the kind professionals use,” he said. “It's going to completely transform our holiday snaps, I can promise you that.”<br><br>“You can turn that big lens on me any time,” said Maddy with a pout.<br><br>“I shouldn't, Derek,” said Roger. “You might break it.”<br><br>“Oh, Roger!” exclaimed Shirley.<br><br>“I know,” cried Mrs. Wilson, with a jingle of expensive jewellery. “Why don't you take a photo of Maisie?”<br><br>Maisie was sitting on a low stool by Mrs. Wilson's feet. Mr. Wilson pointed the lens at her and she smiled for the camera, but Mrs. Wilson wasn't happy.<br><br>“No, no,” she patted Maisie smartly on the shoulder, “do it properly. Go over by the window.”<br><br>Everyone looked excited, so with a wry grin Maisie stood up and moved into the warm patch of evening sun. Mrs. Wilson jumped up and frowned at her critically, then made her twist slightly to one side, hands on hips. Maisie noted a change in their expressions. Her dress, she guessed, has just gone transparent.<br><br>Yes, with the sun shining in from behind, they would see the shape of her breasts, the darker circles of her nipples, the curves of her waist and thighs, the narrow triangle of her thong.<br><br>Once again, she was exposing herself to a bunch of strangers – inadvertently, this time. The thought made her nipples stiffen against the fabric of her dress.<br><br>She didn't let on that she knew. It would only have spoiled their fun and made her more embarrassed. Besides, technically, she wasn't doing anything wrong. She was fully clothed. The fault lay in the design of the dress, not her. And, given that her audience was a group of senior citizens, it wasn't like she had to worry about things getting out of hand.<br><br>Mr. Wilson clicked away, while Mrs. Wilson asked Maisie to adopt different poses. She was obviously a frustrated creative director. Just when Maisie thought things might wind down, Mrs. Wilson said, “Now for a double portrait. Colin, you're up.”<br><br>He looked keen but agonizingly shy. Shirley gave him an encouraging shove. He stumbled to his feet, then stood awkwardly beside Maisie, blushing.<br><br>“What a statuesque male,” said Roger, and everyone laughed.<br><br>“Maisie, be a dear and drape yourself over the hunky Colin, would you?” Mrs. Wilson's instructions were greeting with cheers and claps. Swept along by the general enthusiasm, Maisie leaned against him, back arched, one knee raised and bent. The pose exaggerated her curves and revealed almost all of one lovely thigh. The clapping became louder. The camera flashed.<br><br>“Make sure I get a copy of that one,” shouted Roger.<br><br>Shirley bustled into Colin's place. She was giggling so much, she practically had to be held upright. Laughter being infectious, Maisie found herself chuckling too.<br><br>“Isn't Maisie a wonderful sport?” Mrs Wilson said appreciatively. “I wonder if she would pose in her underwear?”<br><br>There were loud cheers, then deafening silence as everyone waited for the answer.<br><br>“But Mrs. Wilson …” Maisie was shocked. What underwear? As everyone in the room probably knew by now, she was only wearing a thong. If she took off the dress, she would be all but naked.<br><br>“Yes, Maisie?”<br><br>“Um ...” She hesitated, afraid that raising these objections would draw even more attention to how under-dressed she was.<br><br>“If you're worried about your modesty,” Mrs. Wilson said indulgently, “I'm sure we can work around that. And think what a marvellous birthday present it would be for Derek.”<br><br>Roger hummed 'Happy Birthday to You' and everyone applauded. Maisie had suspected arriving without a present would come back to haunt her, and now it had. She was starting to feel slightly flushed and out of her depth, but, after enjoying all that champagne and caviare, she felt a strong desire to please her hosts if she possibly good.<br><br>She glanced at Mr. Wilson. He raised his eyebrows helplessly, as though to say Mrs. Wilson were a law unto herself.<br><br>Well, Mrs. Wilson was right about one thing. It would make a nice birthday present.<br><br>With a resigned smile that evoked cries of celebration, she turned her back on them and pushed down her shoulder straps. As quickly as she could, she slid the dress off her hips. The room went quiet as they caught a glimpse of one breast. Then something like an awed hush fell as her nearly nude bottom emerged from its cloud of chiffon.<br><br>As soon as her feet were free of the dress, Mrs. Wilson swooped like a hawk and carried it off, folding it triumphantly over her arm. Maisie covered her breasts with her hands. Suddenly very conscious of her bottom, she was about to face the room again when Mrs. Wilson stopped her.<br><br>“What a pretty thong.” She turned Maisie slightly so everyone could have another good look at her backside. “Isn't that a pretty thong, everyone?”<br><br>“Amazing how it stays on,” said Maddy.<br><br>They discussed who should be photographed with Maisie next. Her heart plummeted when Roger stepped forward.<br><br>With so much on show, she didn't think she would be up to striking a pose. No matter – Roger took charge, swinging her around so that she was in profile and then hugging her tightly from behind. Something nudged against her buttocks. It didn't feel very big, but it was definitely there.<br><br>“Smile, Maisie,” said Mrs. Wilson, “unless you want me to come over there and tickle you.”<br><br>Maisie instantly grinned for all that her life was worth. As soon as the snap was taken, Maddy jumped up to join her husband. “A merry threesome!” she said, winking. Mrs. Wilson took charge this time, getting Maisie to face front with the couple on either side of her.<br><br>“You'll have to crowd them in a bit,” said Mr. Wilson. “I can't get them all in frame without making them look tiny.”<br><br>Roger seized the opportunity to stand behind Maisie and press himself against her bottom again, but Mrs. Wilson still wasn't satisfied. “Maisie, can you put one arm around Maddy, so she can cuddle up?”<br><br>Maisie needed both her arms for covering her chest. But thinking she'd be able to keep herself decent for a short while with one hand, she agreed. Unfortunately, as soon as she threw her arm around Maddy's back, Maddy reacted, slapping her own palm on Maisie's breast. Maisie gasped in surprise, and Mr. Wilson duly caught the moment on camera.<br><br>“You don't mind, do you?” Maddy giggled. “It's just a piece of fun!”<br><br>The shameful truth was, Maisie could feel her whole body responding sexually in a way that appalled her. The feeling rose from her groin, through the pit of her stomach, all the way up to her vocal cords. It made her sick and light-headed. Why? She didn't even find any of these people attractive, except for Mr. Wilson just a little bit. It was the situation. Being the only one naked. Not that she was entirely naked, thank God.<br><br>Maddy seemed to be enjoying herself too. Mr. Wilson had lowered his camera, but Maddy kept her hand on Maisie's breast. She'd adjusted her grip so that the nipple was now between her bony fingers, where she could tweak it at will. Maisie had a moment of relief as Roger stepped away from behind her. Then she felt Maddy's remaining hand snaking around her back and up under her armpit. It pushed under her elbow to cup her other breast.<br><br>“How's that?” Maddy asked Mrs. Wilson.<br><br>“Splendid,” Mrs. Wilson grinned. “Maisie, you can drop that arm now.”<br><br>It didn't occur to her to argue. Her willpower had drained away. She felt hot, soft and pliable. Letting her arm flop to her side, she stood there with her exposed breasts in Maddy's hands. Apparently forgetting that she was supposed to be covering them, Maddy fondled them instead, her thumbs stroking the pale, pointed nipples. The camera flashed repeatedly.<br><br>“Let's make this next one all girls,” said Mrs. Wilson. She came and stood next to Maisie. Her thumb hooked itself casually in the front of Maisie's thong. Maddy, meanwhile, was still playing with Maisie's breasts. Mr. Wilson clicked away.<br><br>Suddenly, Maddy took away both hands, letting Maisie's breasts bounce free, firm and keen. Maisie's arms were around Maddy and Mrs. Wilson, so it was impossible to cover up again. Everyone clapped and laughed, pointing at Maisie's shocked face, and she found herself laughing as well. Then, while the camera continued to click and whir, Maddy took a firm grip on the waist of Maisie's thong and pushed down. Mrs Wilson did the same on her side. Colin's and Shirley's faces lit up in expectation.<br><br>For a fraction of a second, the triangular front clung to Maisie's pussy. Then it sprang free and the thong was halfway down her thighs. She gasped, but it was too late.<br><br>They won't stop until they see me nude, she thought. And I can't stand up to them, I haven't got it in me.<br><br>Maddy and Mrs. Wilson stunned her. They were both easily old enough to be her mother, but there was nothing motherly about the way they were behaving. They were completely merciless in stripping and groping her. She wasn't a person with feelings. She was just a bouncy young body for them to exploit.<br><br>Maisie resigned herself to being – once again – the only one naked. She didn't resist as the thong was pushed down past her knees. She even gave a sexy little jiggle to make it drop to the floor.<br><br>She was now completely bare. Mrs. Wilson rested her hand on Maisie's bald mound, perilously close to her swelling pussy. Maddy's fingers stroked her bottom.<br><br>Making a strangulated noise in his throat, Mr. Wilson lurched down on one knee. Maisie assumed he was going for a low-angled shot. To her surprise, he toppled forward on his face.<br><br>He curled up on his side, clutching his chest.<br><br>It dawned on her that he was having a heart attack. Freeing herself from the ladies' grasp, she scampered forward and knelt down beside him. Mr. Wilson's face was contused with pain. She looked up at the others as they gathered round. “Mrs. Wilson, does Mr. Wilson have any medication?”<br><br>“No, no, nothing like this has ever ….” Mrs. Wilson was teetering, ready to keel over too.<br><br>“Maddy, help Mrs. Wilson, will you? Shirley, put a cushion under Mr. Wilson's head. One of you phone for an ambulance.” Maisie took a desperate glance around. Nothing was happening. It was as though she were rattling out instructions to a bunch of waxworks. Roger was staring at her, still enthralled by her bare body.<br><br>Giving up on them, Maisie ran to the telephone in the hall. The operator said, “The ambulance is on its way. Please hold the line while we take your details.”<br><br>“Um, okay – ” Maisie could picture herself standing there, stark naked, still answering questions when the paramedics pounded on the door.<br><br>Roger had followed her. She signalled him to go and get her dress, but he shrugged in bafflement.<br><br>The operator was talking on. As well as some details about Mr. Wilson, they insisted on taking Maisie's name. “Are you a relation?”<br><br>“No, I'm his –” She was on the point of saying 'bookseller', but that sounded absurd, so she mumbled, “I'm a friend.”<br><br>It wasn't until after the words were out of her mouth that she realized how shady this sounded. If they'd thought before that it was strange that a young woman who wasn't a relation was phoning up, by now they would be scenting scandal.<br><br>Sure enough, the operator asked, “Did anything bring the attack on? What was the gentleman doing at the time?”<br><br>“He was a – it was a party.”<br><br>“With alcohol?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“And any other entertainment?”<br><br>She paused. She was almost certain this wasn't a standard question. The way it had gone straight to the point completely petrified her. At the same time, she couldn't bring herself to lie when a man's life was at stake.<br><br>“Some – some photography.”<br><br>“I see.”<br><br>She could hear the cog's turning in the operator's mind, but nothing more was said.<br><br>“Can I put the phone down now?”<br><br>“Yes, thank you.”<br><br>She hurried back inside and knelt next to Mr. Wilson. Thankfully, he didn't seem any worse. Then, all aflutter, she stood up and roughly pulled on her dress. It looked very tarty to her now. Mrs. Wilson's CD was still playing. It sounded like stripper music, so she turned it off. She was still worried about that operator – she'd bet anything he'd gone straight on the radio to the ambulance driver with all the dirty details. Important for everyone's sake to make a good impression when they arrived. She cast her eyes around for her thong. It wasn't anywhere to be seen. And the dress was barely decent without it.<br><br>“Has anyone seen my thong?”<br><br>Most of the group were too distraught to pay her any attention. Roger ostentatiously avoided her eye. She was pretty sure he'd scooped it up in the confusion, the sick old pervert. She was trying to summon the nerve to confront him when the bell rang.<br><br>No one else moved, so she went to answer the door. As she did so, she became terribly conscious of her dress. A strong gust of wind, and everything would be on view.<br><br>She opened the door on two burly, solemn young men. Their lips crinkled slightly when they saw her.<br><br>“You're the, er, lady who called?”<br><br>Flushing, Maisie nodded and pointed them into the living room. The paramedics knelt down next to Mr. Wilson and began fiddling with their stethoscopes. While they worked, Maisie stood well back, anxious for Mr. Wilson but feeling more and more like an outsider.<br><br>One of the paramedics beckoned for her. Pressing her hands down on the front of her dress, she stepped forward shyly.<br><br>“I understand there was some kind of photography session? Were any illegal substances consumed? Did any physical contact take place?”<br><br>“No!” she said, shocked. “No, I swear!”<br><br>He looked disbelieving. In another ten minutes, the ambulance was moving off, Mr. Wilson inside. As they watched it go from the front garden, Mrs. Wilson stood next to Maisie, sobbing on her shoulder. Maisie felt distraught, but also out of place.<br><br>“Well, I'd better be getting off home,” she said gently. “I do hope Mr. Wilson will be alright.”<br><br>The others, Maisie knew, were planning to follow the ambulance in taxis. Mrs. Wilson looked up, wet cheeked. “Oh, you'll come too, won't you, Maisie?”<br><br>“Um ...”<br><br>“It'll mean so much to Derek. You won't desert us?”<br><br>Maisie hesitated. A lengthy visit to hospital in a short dress with no underwear seemed like a recipe for further humiliation. On the other hand, she was fond of Mr. Wilson, and, although it was hardly her fault she'd been stripped naked in front of him, she couldn't help feeling somewhat responsible for his condition.<br><br>Ten minutes later, she was being bundled into a taxi with Shirley and Mrs. Wilson, squashed between them in her pale green dress like a lettuce leaf. There followed a very drab time at the hospital. They waited for hours in a quiet corridor, sitting in a row. She must have drifted off.<br><br>A hand gripped her shoulder and shook her awake. A pretty young nurse leaned over her.<br><br>“For God's sake, cover yourself up!”<br><br>Maisie discovered that it was broad daylight. The surrounding chairs were full of out-patients. During the night her dress had ridden up over her hips, and she was flashing everyone.<br><br>Blood rushing to her cheeks, Maisie squirmed upright. She pulled down her dress and stammered an apology. The nurse gave her a haughty look and strode off down the corridor.<br><br>Maisie was aware of eyes boring into her – some curious, some amused, some disapproving, a few disappointed that the show was over. She was alone. Where were Roger and Maddy and Colin and Shirley and Mrs. Wilson?<br><br>Too self-conscious to sit still, she stood up and, her hands carefully pushing down her dress, trotted in what she hoped was the direction of the ward. She walked along a grey corridor and peered through a doorway. Four beds down, she saw them. They were all gathered around Mr. Wilson, who spotted Maisie and waved. Apart from being in a hospital robe, he looked his usual self. Tearing up with joy, happy as a dog reunited with its owner, she bounded forward, only to almost collide with the angry young nurse from before.<br><br>She shrank out of the nurse's way, then hurried to the bedside. The others made room for her. Mr. Wilson patted the bed. She perched on the edge of it. Close up, he seemed pale and shaken, but there was plenty of strength in the hand that squeezed her knee.<br><br>“It was just an episode, so they tell me,” he explained. “With any luck I should be out by the end of the day or tomorrow morning.”<br><br>“We were going to wake you,” said Mrs. Wilson. “But Roger convinced us that it was a shame when you were having such a nice sleep.”<br><br>“How thoughtful of him,” said Maisie.<br><br>One slow, drowsy afternoon the following week, Mr. Wilson reappeared in the bookshop. His step was spry, and he was wearing a smart blazer with a crest. He glanced around and saw that he had the place to himself. “Hello, Maisie.”<br><br>Maisie sat up straight behind her desk. She threw back her shoulders, clasped her hands and rubbed her knees together. She'd missed him.<br><br>“Mr. Wilson, how are you?”<br><br>“Tickety boo, thanks. Been doing a lot of resting. And a lot of reading. It's about time I stocked up on a few titles.”<br><br>He glanced meaningfully at the stepladder.<br><br>“Oh! Are you … sure? You wouldn't rather wait in case you strain your, er, eyes?”<br><br>“Perhaps,” he said, “I could take another look at that encyclopedia of great battles?”<br><br>“Yes, Mr. Wilson.”<br><br>Heart pounding, Maisie rose from behind the desk and seized the stepladder. She was halfway up it when Mrs. Wilson came wafting through the door.<br><br>“Ah, there you are, Derek! Found anything yet?”<br><br>“Not yet,” said Mr. Wilson. “No hurry, is there?”<br><br>“None at all.” Mrs. Wilson joined him. She looked up grinning. “Good afternoon, Maisie.”<br><br>“Good afternoon, Mrs. Wilson.” Maisie spoke in a small voice. She could see where this was going.<br><br>“ Now I come to think of it, I could do with a good book myself. What an eye-catching top shelf! Where, oh where, shall I start …?”`

                    content: `“This one, Mr Wilson?”<br><br>“Next one along. 'Fraid you'll have to stretch for it!”<br><br>Elongating her back, Maisie hooked two fingertips over the dusty, faded spine of a hefty tome about the Boer War and gave it a tug.<br><br>She was teetering, in mid air, in something like the Lord of the Dance yoga pose – not for the first time. Hard to say exactly how it had happened, but climbing up the stepladder in a short skirt and putting on a bit of a show seemed to have become a key component of her sales technique over recent weeks. It wasn't the sort of thing they did in other bookshops. Still, it was great for getting the kinks of out your back. It also did a lot for Mr Wilson, to judge by his dreamy expression.<br><br>The Boer War book slid off the shelf into her waiting palm, bringing a musty smell of old paper with it. The weight of it surprised her and she wobbled slightly on her lofty perch.<br><br>“Oh, whoops-a-daisy, steady there.”<br><br>His look of intense interest turning to one of concern, Mr Wilson put a hand on her bare leg to steady her, so high it very nearly went up her Mango sundress. Mrs Wilson did likewise, her painted nails chilly on her inner thigh. “Not to worry! We'll catch you if you fall!”<br><br>I'm sure you will, Maisie thought, an image popping into her head of Mr and Mrs Wilson as a pair of cheerfully grinning crocodiles, eager to gobble her up.<br><br>They were both sneaking sly peeks up her skirt. She didn't really see the point – they'd seen everything she had on previous occasions – but they were very good customers so she really didn't mind.<br><br>“Phew! Thanks very much. I'm okay now.”<br><br>“Better safe than sorry, that's my motto,” said Mr Wilson.<br><br>Still gripping her firmly, they helped her down. The slender redhead found herself cornered between Mr Wilson, a natty ex-military man with a clipped moustache and a blazer with shiny brass buttons, and his tall, thin wife with her long, straying fingers.<br><br>“That was exciting.” Maisie hugged the book, her cheeks colouring as she wondered what was coming next. The Wilsons had timed their visit well. It was the end of the day and they had the bookshop to themselves. It was just the three of them and deep, shadowy aisles closed-packed with printed matter of all shapes and sizes. While the Wilsons might have looked like, and mostly were, a harmless old couple, she wasn't entirely sure she could trust them to behave in these circumstances. Which, to be honest, was what she liked about them.<br><br>Mr Wilson pinched the corner of his moustache. “Now, Maisie, Mrs W has something she wants to ask you... you'll be a good girl and hear her out, won't you?”<br><br>“It's nothing really,” Mrs Wilson tittered. “It's only, we were hoping to arrange another of our little soirées, and we were wondering if you'd like to attend. You know, the usual thing. Just a few friends. Perhaps a little photography?”<br><br>“Um, are you sure that's a good idea?”<br><br>The last time they did that, Mr Wilson ended up in hospital.<br><br>“It'll be fine. Do please say you'll come.”<br><br>“If you're worried about me,” said Mr Wilson, “the sawbones has given me a clean bill of health. Fit as a fiddle.”<br><br>Mrs Wilson poked a finger over the top of the Boer War book to touch the girl's milky-white clavicle.<br><br>“They'll be champagne. Lots of it.”<br><br>Maisie loved champagne. Her pert little mouth quivered slightly.<br><br>“And caviar,” Mrs Wilson continued.<br><br>“Caviar?”<br><br>She felt her resolve weakening.<br><br>Just then, the doorbell tinkled and a woman swept in. She was built on generous lines and wore flip-flops and a flowy floral maxi dress. Her face and arms were brown, her grey hair up in a neat bun. She took off her sunglasses and glanced around the aisles until her eyes alighted on Maisie.<br><br>“Auntie Barbara!”<br><br>Aunt Barbara owned the bookshop. Maisie had been standing in for her while she took a long, restful holiday in Normandy.<br><br>“Auntie! I thought you weren't due back for another fortnight!” Maisie let out a squeak of delight and scampered forward to greet her, then remembered the heavy book she was carrying and stopped in her tracks.<br><br>“Hello, you. I felt so much better, I got restless and decided to head on back and surprise you. Just dropped off my suitcases and came to see how you're getting on. It's alright, tend to your customers first.”<br><br>“Okay. Did you want this book, Mr Wilson? You know Mr and Mrs Wilson don't you, Auntie Barbara?”<br><br>They exchanged pleasantries. Her aunt watched carefully as Maisie entered the purchase in the ledger and rang it up on the till.<br><br>Maisie couldn't help feeling a slight irrational fear that Mr and Mrs Wilson might say something incriminating about her escapades while her aunt had been away, but she needn't have worried. They behaved with decorum and excused themselves after a minute or two.<br><br>“Seemed like very satisfied customers,” said Aunt Barbara once they were alone. “So you've been managing then?” She took up the ledger and inspected it. “This is really good, I'm impressed.”<br><br>Sitting behind the desk in her aunt's battered antique swivel chair, Maisie purred with pleasure. She had done a pretty good job, in her own unconventional way. Despite the distractions of the Wilsons and posing for Nicole's life drawing class. But immediately the pleasure turned to disquiet. She was thrilled to see her aunt, of course, but what did this mean? Was she about to be sent packing? She'd grown to love it here, in Dalchester, working in the bookshop. She didn't want to go home.<br><br>“Why don't we close up and we can have a nice chat?”<br><br>A nice chat? Already she could hear her Aunt saying, “Thanks for all your excellent work, but you must be champing at the bit to get back to Slough.” Back to boring temp work? Back to the hotel of mum and dad? The very thought was enough to turn Maisie's stomach into a flip-flopping mess like a bundle of washing on a slow spin. What she needed was a delaying tactic, some way of putting off the conversation until her aunt had gotten used to having her around and she had become part of the fixtures and fixings.<br><br>Thus she couldn't help heaving a sigh of relief when, just as she was flipping the sign on the door over from Open to Closed, a harassed-looking woman with short curly hair came bursting in and exclaimed breathlessly:<br><br>“Barbara, you're back, thank God. I was just passing and I thought that was you. I need to talk to you. I'm in a terrible pickle.”<br><br>The woman's mouth was wobbly, her eyes close to tears. Aunt Barbara took one look at her and ordered Maisie to fetch the emergency bottle of brandy from the back of the shop.<br><br>By the time Maisie trotted back, Aunt Barbara was settled behind her desk as if she'd never been away. The distraught lady was fidgeting on a straight-backed chair, groaning and shaking her head as she tried to decide where to start her tale of woe. Maisie poured out a stiff drink, then hovered, unsure whether to stay or go.<br><br>“Maisie, this is Miss Tweedle. She owns Heart's Desire, the erotica bookshop on Dowager's Walk. How's the erotica business, Hattie?”<br><br>“Oh, you know – up and down like a pair of French knickers.” This was an old joke, apparently. Miss Tweedle chuckled briefly, then swallowed her brandy and subsided into gloom.<br><br>On second thoughts, Maisie thought it might be better if she made herself scarce, so they could talk in private. But Miss Tweedle said, “No... Maisie, is it?... Stay, if you don't mind.”<br><br>Aunt Barbara's brow was creased with worry. “What's going on, Hattie?”<br><br>“I've got and done something really stupid.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>Miss Tweedle groaned. “I've become a publisher!”<br><br>Maisie and Aunt Barbara exchanged a puzzled glance. Miss Tweedle laughed hollowly. “Thought it would be fun to start my own publishing label. Fun! I'm releasing my first title next week, to coincide with the Dalchester Literary Festival.”<br><br>“Congratulations,” said Maisie, only to bite her tongue as Miss Tweedle subjected her to a baleful look.<br><br>“Don't you mean commiserations? If it's not a success, I'm totally screwed. I'll lose my shirt – and my sanity. Oh God, what was I thinking?”<br><br>At a signal from Aunt Barbara, Maisie hastily refilled Miss Tweedle's glass. It emptied just as quickly as before.<br><br>“What are you publishing?” asked Aunt Barbara.<br><br>Miss Tweedle sniffed. “Jean-Louis Robbe's great erotic novel, The Naked English Girl. Actually, that wasn't plan A. Plan A was to get Jean-Louis to write an entirely new novel, his first in twenty years. Thought that would be a bit of a coup for a new boutique publishing label. I even paid him a decent advance. Unfortunately, the old coot failed to cough up a manuscript in time, so I've had to settle for issuing a reprint. I've got the author coming over especially, but what if no one's interested? He's so unfashionable. Even The Naked English Girl, which is a classic, an absolute keystone of erotica... no one reads it.” She buried her head in her hands. “Honestly, I could be facing ruin. What was I thinking? I'm dead meat.”<br><br>“Come on, Hattie, I'm sure it's not as bad as all that.”<br><br>“Sorry. It's the stress. It's all getting a bit much for me.” Miss Tweedle breathed in through soggy-sounding nasal channels and blinked red-rimmed eyes. “Thank Christ, I persuaded Jean-Louis to do a talk on how to write an erotica novel, and tickets for that have sold quite well. Only thing is, he's insisting on having a model in a bikini to assist him – a young, pretty one needless to say, else I'd do it myself, I'm not ashamed. Anyway, I haven't the first idea how to go about getting a model, so I thought of Maisie.”<br><br>“Me?” Maisie blurted out.<br><br>“I've seen what she's done for you here since you've been away, Barbara. You must have noticed the shop's been heaving.” A note of bitterness crept into Miss Tweedle's voice. “This one's been sucking away all the local trade with her porcelain good looks and her endless supply of short skirts. Especially my customers. Bloody sex maniacs. Not that I'm blaming you, poppet; you might as well flaunt what you've got while you've got it, because it bloody well won't last.”<br><br>Maisie pushed down nervously on her tiny frock, wishing she could cover up more of her slim, creamy thighs.<br><br>“Sorry, auntie. I just wanted to be useful and sell books. And they really don't seem to sell themselves.”<br><br>Aunt Barbara allowed Miss Tweedle to run on for a few minutes more, then said, “Tell you what, Hattie, why I don't make it up to you by lending you my secret weapon for a day or two? She'll help out with this talk and around the shop, and do whatever she can to make the release of The Naked English Girl a roaring success. Won't you, Maisie?”<br><br>Maisie was uneasily aware that people weren't supposed to lend people to each other like chattels. But then again, she'd be quite happy to be Aunt Barbara's chattels, just so long as she got to stay in beautiful, leafy Dalchester. Besides which, her heart couldn't help going out to Miss Tweedle, who already seemed halfway to becoming a homeless bag lady.<br><br>“No problem,” she said reassuringly. “Whatever you need, Miss Tweedle!”<br><br>It wasn't ideal, the fact that she would be out of the shop. Was this the thin end of the wedge that would see her bundled off back to Slough? But at least it would delay any conversations about her future for a couple of weeks. That would have to do for now.<br><br>“Oh, thank you so much, Barbara, you're a life-safer!” Glimmers of tears peeped from the corners of her sad, droopy eyes as Miss Tweedle leapt up to kiss and hug Maisie's aunt. She didn't bother too much about thanking Maisie, rightly supposing that the pretty redhead was at her aunt's beck and call.<br><br>There was only one outstanding matter of concern. After Miss Tweedle had gone, Maisie asked, “Are you quite sure this is okay with you, auntie? Miss Tweedle said something about a bikini. It wouldn't bother you, auntie, me, er, flaunting myself like that?”<br><br>“Flaunting?” Aunt Barbara scoffed. “What a choice of word. We're not living in Victorian times, I don't think we need to worry about causing a scandal. Besides, it's all in the cause of literature.”<br><br>“Oh! Okay then. Just checking.”<br><br>Well, that was a relief. But could she be sure Aunt Barbara really meant it? After all, she wasn't to know that her darling niece sometimes had more than a bit of trouble keeping her clothes on.`

                    content: `The following week, Maisie was still no clearer as to whether or not she had a future in the second-hand bookselling business. Her aunt hadn't said anything, and she hadn't dared ask. She'd carried on helping out at the shop, keeping her forays up the stepladder to a minimum but wearing various low-cut frocks to show willing. There'd been a slight falling off in custom, but nothing drastic.<br><br>For the moment, she was more concerned about the talk. She felt nervous about the event, which was to be the centrepiece of the launch of the first title of Miss Tweedle's new publishing label. Since Miss Tweedle was annoyingly vague about it, there was no way of preparing, and she was worried about making a fool of herself. Still, she'd picked out a dainty triangle bikini which she was sure would look nice.<br><br>On the day of the launch, Maisie, in a boho tunic and denim shorts and with her hair up in a scrunchie, cycled on her aunt's shopper to Dowager's Walk to help set up. By now, the Dalchester Literary Festival was in full swing. The media were in town, vans topped with satellite dishes clogging the High Street. The familiar faces of A-list novelists, celebrity chefs and comedians-turned-writers glowered, grinned or gazed soulfully from posters, and she gawped as a famous author – a beautiful tall, thin young black woman with several bestsellers to her name – swayed gracefully out of a minicab and into the foyer of the Dalchester Royal Hotel.<br><br>She hadn't appreciated until now what a big deal the festival was. Every small business owner in town seemed to be cashing in on it, with restaurants and bars serving literary-themed menus and cocktails. No wonder Aunt Barbara had cut her recuperation short to rush back and resume the running of the bookshop.<br><br>Maisie had expected Heart's Desire to be a seedy-looking place with blacked out windows and a hole-in-the-corner vibe. Quite the reverse, it was actually one of the smartest and grandest shops on Dowager's Walk, which was otherwise a fairly ugly, unloved side street. Rather than being discreetly blacked out, it had a big display window through which she saw a bright, tranquil space painted in soft pastels and light greys, like a luxury hotel room. Inside, the shop was divided into neat, orderly sections each with its exotic label – “Comix”, “Hentai Manga”, “'Eurotica” – and there was a glass case containing valuable rare editions in exquisite gilt bindings. In short, the shop had all the elegance and outward sophistication and air of being pampered and adored that Miss Tweedle herself lacked.<br><br>The shop was closed for the day so that everything could be reorganized. The event was taking place at the rear of the premises, which meant that the central aisle had to be moved, rented plastic stacking chairs set out, a bar station set up for drinks and snacks. On top of that, there were several boxes of books to unpack, and piles of Jean-Louis Robbe memorabilia – old paperbacks with lurid covers, DVDs of film adaptations, posters, even some VHS videos.<br><br>“Here we are, this is what all the fuss is about.” Huffing and puffing, curly hair even wilder than usual, Miss Tweedle cut open a box, pulled out one of the identical paperbacks stacked within and handed it to Maisie. “The Naked English Girl. Your very own copy. Would've given you one before, but the blooming things have only just arrived, hence the panic.”<br><br>The paperback had a sunny yellow cover. Under the title was picture of a pretty girl, nude but for a straw sunhat and a pair of sunglasses with red plastic rims. She was lounging gracefully in a deckchair, reading a book which she held away from her at an angle so it didn't obscure the lines of her small breasts and flat tummy.<br><br>“That's the original cover art,” said Miss Tweedle proudly. “The model was Jean-Louis' wife, Lise. You'll meet her later on, fingers crossed.”<br><br>“What's Mr Robbe like?”<br><br>Miss Tweedle looked up, box cutter in hand, and smiled.<br><br>“He really is a great author. He doesn't let on, but you have to understand, Maisie, it's tough for him, adapting to a changing world. There was once a time when the sophisticated erotic novel was considered a cutting edge art form. But that changed, and Jean-Louis was cast out into the wilderness. True, there's been a whole new interest in erotica recently, but in a way that's made it even worse, because he's still forgotten, and now there's a whole bunch of Johnny-come-latelys steeling his thunder.” She sat on the box of books and sighed. “God, I hope this goes well, for his sake and mine. If only he would get on and write a new novel, really show everyone how it's done. Sad to say, the last I'd heard, he'd gotten absolutely nowhere. Maybe there's a reason he hasn't written a word in twenty years. Maybe he really is past it. I hope not.”<br><br>Maisie felt sorry for poor Miss Tweedle and vowed to do her best to help. They were busily putting together displays of The Naked English Girl when there was a gentle tapping at the outer door.<br><br>A tall young man stood there, a thin canvas bag, the sort you use to carry a laptop, slung over one shoulder. He was dressed in a slim fit tee and chinos and had soft, friendly eyes. He looked no older than about twenty. Around his slender neck was an ID card on a lanyard, which he held up for their inspection. Maisie opened the door a crack.<br><br>“Hi, I'm with Litstop.”<br><br>“Sorry?”<br><br>“Litstop? The Dalchester literary festival's official online newsletter? Name's Ben. Saw the poster for tonight's event in your window and I wondered if you'd like us to give it a plug for you?”<br><br>“Well, that would be nice,” said Miss Tweedle, who had overheard and jumped to her feet, “especially as I emailed you a press release last week. And got absolutely sod all response.”<br><br>The boy flinched at her biting tone – or maybe it was at the belligerent way she was clutching her box cutter.<br><br>“Ah! Sorry about that. My bad. There's just the editor and us unpaid interns, so it hasn't been easy keeping up.” Thinking quickly, he said, “Event's not until six-thirty, yeah? Not too late to get the word out. I'll get it sorted right away, if you like. Could I come in?”<br><br>Stepping inside, he pulled a tablet out of his bag. “Would you happen to have a copy of the PR release?”<br><br>“I can probably lay my hands on one.” Still far from mollified, Miss Tweedle put down the box cutter and flounced off to the inner office.<br><br>Ben picked up one of the gleaming new paperbacks and perused the blurb. “A naïve English girl with boyfriend problems goes to the South of France and meets a sophisticated older man,” he read out loud.<br><br>His left eyebrow – it was soft and fluffy, a perfect match for his eyelashes – twitched in amusement. Maisie stared back coldly, out of loyalty to Miss Tweedle's publishing venture, but also because she wanted him to know she was a serious bookseller with a suitably mature and humourless attitude towards her literary wares.<br><br>Miss Tweedle returned with a printout, which he scanned with practised speed. “There's going to be a live model? That's different.”<br><br>“Yes, Maisie's doing the honours.”<br><br>In an instant, Maisie's expression of frosty superiority gave way to a rosy blush. Great, so much for being taken seriously. Now he would think she was just some glorified piece of tottie who was only here for her bosoms, not her brains. It was only a matter of time before he started leering and mentally undressing her.<br><br>Or was she overreacting? Slightly annoyingly, Ben seemed in too much of a hurry to give her much thought. Instead, after taking no more than polite interest in this latest revelation, he moved briskly about his business, using his tablet to snap a few photos of one of the Naked English Girl displays, with the pair of them standing on either side of it.<br><br>“I'll write this straight into the back end. Won't take more than a few secs.” He sat down at the sales counter and began typing. Hypnotised by the sight of his thumbs tapping away at the tablet's touchscreen, Maisie was caught off-guard when he suddenly asked for her name.<br><br>Did she want her name bandied about all over town on an e-newsletter? “Just say 'a model',” she decided. “Or better yet, 'an anonymous model'.”<br><br>He curled his lip. He had nice lips, she noticed.<br><br>“What's wrong with that?”<br><br>“First rule of journalism – accuracy. There's not a single anonymous thing about you.”<br><br>Was he flirting with her? She tilted her chin coquettishly. Miss Tweedle harrumphed. “Are we about done?”<br><br>“Drop in a pic. Save. Hey presto, it's live on our landing page.” Ben held up the tablet for them to see. There their faces were on the Litstop website, right next to the horsey grin of Lee Gurney, a comedian whose scandalous tell-all autobiography had just been released in hardback. “I'll tweet it around too, give it a boost. I'm sure it'll be a great success.”<br><br>Conscious that Miss Tweedle hadn't exactly showered him in gratitude, Maisie hung in the doorway for a moment as she saw Ben out and treated him to an extra sweet smile. “Thanks for that.”<br><br>“No worries. Best of luck with your modelling gig.”<br><br>She rolled her eyes, trying not to show how nervous the mere mention of it made her feel.<br><br>“You know what, I don't think I've ever met anyone with such a keen sense of duty to literature. Maybe we ought to do a follow-up interview sometime?”<br><br>“Maybe,” she grinned.<br><br>He held her gaze for a fraction of a second, then turned and moved off, quickening his pace as he hurried to catch a bus. She followed him with her eyes for a moment. Then she heard Miss Tweedle:<br><br>“Maisie! I've just had a text from Jean-Louis!”<br><br>The French had arrived.`

                    content: `Now it came to the crunch, Maisie was nervous about meeting her very first erotica author.<br><br>She had one main worry as she parked at the railway station, having dashed across town in Miss Tweedle's dusty Skoda to collect Monsieur Robbe and his wife and bring them back to the shop. What if he was totally sex mad?<br><br>You'd have to be, wouldn't you, to write a book like The Naked English Girl? And for all she knew, after his long, dull journey he could be champing at the bit to sample some local talent. God, she hoped not. It wouldn't help the launch to go smoothly if she had to keep fighting off some horny old gent with octopus arms.<br><br>Hurrying onto the platform, she found it packed with press and excited autograph hunters awaiting the London train. No chance that they were there for Jean-Louis Robbe, alas. Word must have gotten out that some other, more newsworthy personage was en route.<br><br>Sure enough, when the train pulled in, a familiar figure appeared in the doorway of the First Class carriage, cocking his head like a budgie on amphetamines.<br><br>It was Lee Gurney, the comedian. It seemed like just a second ago that she had been looking at his beaky grin on the Litstop site. Now she thought about it, she remembered seeing something on Twitter about him coming up before a magistrate for drink driving offences and being stripped of his licence. He could have slipped into Dalchester quietly by chauffeured car, but presumably arriving by train like this was a calculated act of bravado, an ironic gesture that would reap even more headlines.<br><br>For some minutes the platform was impassable, dense with a media scrum. It only began to clear when the comedian, having tossed out a few soundbites and posed for a few selfies, moved on in search of a taxi to take him to his hotel.<br><br>As the hubbub died down, Maisie discerned a distinguished, slightly elderly couple making their way slowly up the platform, wheely bags in tow. The man was tall, in a well-cut casual suit, with the big, kind, sad, sloping face of a Newfoundland. His wife was a pretty, petite little thing turned stout and matronly, all butterscotch tan and fluffy, coppery curls. They were both swathed in silky scarves.<br><br>Spotting the copy of The Naked English Girl in her hand, they trundled towards her, wreathed in smiles.<br><br>So this was the notorious author? He seemed harmless enough at first glance, but you never could tell!<br><br>“Mr and Mrs Robbe?”<br><br>Maisie moved forward to introduce herself, then stiffened as the writer kissed her on both cheeks in greeting. “It's Jean-Louis, please.” Thankfully he kept his hands to himself.<br><br>“Welcome to the Dalchester Literary Festival. Here, let me take those for you.” Stepping back from him just to be on the safe side, she relieved them of their wheely bags, which they were only too glad to surrender. “This way.”<br><br>Trundling the bags behind her, Maisie led them to Miss Tweedle's car.<br><br>“You work for Hattie?” Lise was looking about her, patting at her many pastel-coloured scarves with a hand jingling with beaded and woven bracelets.<br><br>“She's a friend of my aunt's. I'm just lending a hand for a day or two while you're here.”<br><br>“That's exceedingly kind of you.”<br><br>“Not at all, glad to help,” Maisie said, tugging one of the bags out of a pothole. This would have been a good time to reveal that she would also be the model at this evening's talk. But she felt shy of mentioning it, not that they wouldn't find out soon enough.<br><br>As they plodded across the car park, the departing press pack were climbing into a fleet of taxis. Maisie couldn't help reflecting on the difference between the reception poor Jean-Louis was getting and the one accorded to Lee Gurney, whose four-letter-word-laced memoirs would no doubt soar to the top of the bestseller lists as a result.<br><br>“Here we are!” Grunting with effort, she packed the bags into the boot of the Skoda. As she leaned forward to give them a last shove, her billowy Pepe Jeans tunic rode up the small of her back and the curves of her bottom strained against her denim cut-offs in an eye-catching way. Her sixth sense told her this had not gone unnoticed. Glancing up, she expected to find Jean-Louis ogling her, but he was innocently blowing his nose – apparently he suffered badly from hay fever. A pair of eyes was watching, though. They belonged to Lise, and they sparkled with amusement... and something else.<br><br>Maisie coloured, uncertain what to make of this. However, by the time she was driving them across town, she started to think that her mind must have been playing tricks on her. The Robbes seemed like such a sweet couple. Fussing over each other, speaking in gentle, cooing French. As for the supposedly sex mad Jean-Louis – the more she looked at those large, reassuringly friendly features, the harder she found it to believe that they could harbour a single dirty thought.<br><br>Deciding it was silly to keep silent about it, she chirped, “Actually, I'm not just helping out with the chauffeuring. I'm also going to be – er – assisting with the talk this evening.”<br><br>She glanced at Jean-Louis half-curiously, half-fearfully, wondering how he would take this bombshell. Her imagination quickly played out all kinds of scenarios, from cries of gratitude for helping out an impoverished author, to renewed attempts to grope her.<br><br>In the event, he hardly reacted at all – just nodded benignly, then asked a question about Dalchester's one way system.<br><br>Maybe he hadn't heard her properly? Or not understood her English? Or maybe in his world girls stripped down to their bikinis all the time, and it was nothing to get all het up about?<br><br>She had a lot to learn about erotica authors.<br><br>Miss Tweedle had tea and cakes waiting for the Robbes when they arrived – she planned to settle them in their hotel herself a little later on, as it was only a short walk away. No sooner had he said hello and hissed Miss Tweedle's plump cheeks than Jean-Louis nipped straight back out again. Supposedly it was to enjoy the one cigarette a day Lise allowed him, but Maisie suspected he had been moved almost to tears by the sight of the displays and posters for The Naked English Girl that festooned the shop.<br><br>Noticing the way Maisie was eyeing the cakes and pastries, Miss Tweedle muttered to her, “Tuck in, poppet. Glad someone can eat.”<br><br>It was typical of Miss Tweedle that she couldn't even let someone enjoy a deliciously creamy treat without piling on the guilt, Maisie reflected, grabbing an éclair and moving out of the bookseller's way. But then you had to remember she was under a lot of pressure. There was tremor in Miss Tweedle's hand as she passed Lise a cup and saucer. “I don't suppose there's any sign of a new manuscript, is there?”<br><br>Lise shook her russet curls in an emphatic non. “Hattie, I understand your frustration. But I must ask you, please not to press him on the matter. He is devastated, you understand. It is terrible for him that he cannot write; it makes him feel like an old man near to death.”<br><br>Her ears pricking up at this, Maisie peered out through the window worriedly at Jean-Louis. He looked sturdy enough, puffing away on his Gauloise with his cashmere scarf flung rakishly over one shoulder, but you never could tell, maybe he was on the verge of keeling over. Was Lise telling the truth, or was she putting a guilt trip on their distraught publisher, doing to Miss Tweedle what Miss Tweedle did to everyone else? If Miss Tweedle had been planning to say anything, this plea was bound to give her second thoughts.<br><br>Miss Tweedle gazed dolefully into her cup of Darjeeling. “I know, Lise, it's just... I've poured my life savings into this.”<br><br>“And he already has put much time and effort into it, to no avail. To press him will only make it worse. We can only hope for inspiration to strike. Who knows, maybe this talk tonight will... what is the expression? Get his juices flowing?”<br><br>“Yes. Or maybe something else will.”<br><br>With that, they both glanced furtively at Maisie. Realizing they were looking at her, she smiled back, wondering if she dared ask for another cake.`

                    content: `The piece on the Litstop site must have done the trick, because Heart's Desire was full of people that evening. They filed through the door, buying their tickets from Miss Tweedle, then helping themselves to wine and cheese, and browsing among the copies of The Naked English Girl and the other Jean-Louis Robbe memorabilia that was spread everywhere in rich array.<br><br>Maisie observed all this from the safety of the shop's little storeroom-cum-office. Here she, Jean-Louis and Lise were hiding out until it was time for the talk to start. They were standing there in the twilight, with just a desk light on and the evening sun filtering through the reinforced glass window of the back door.<br><br>She was still very anxious, mainly because she had no idea what to expect. She'd gone home, soaked in a bath, done her hair, buffed herself up, and now here she was in a robe over a bikini and a pair of high heels. It was like posing for one of her friend Nicole's life drawing classes, but in a way even worse. This was a talk about erotica, after all. The S-word was in the air.<br><br>Jean-Louis appeared to be experiencing some trepidation too. Lise was rubbing his hands and cooing to him in gentle undertones. Maisie wished someone would coo at her.<br><br>The only good bit of news was that Aunt Barbara had stayed away, on the grounds that she didn't want to make Maisie self-conscious. Maisie was scanning the crowd through a crack in the door, making doubly sure that her aunt wasn't lurking somewhere, when she spotted someone else she knew.<br><br>Ben from Litstop had wandered in, looking alertly to left and right. He'd changed out of his faded tee into a fitted midnight blue long-sleeved shirt that accentuated the wiriness of his frame and the pallor of his skin.<br><br>She beckoned him over.<br><br>“I felt guilty about the mix-up earlier, so I thought I'd do a follow-up piece for the newsletter,” he told her, propping himself casually against the doorframe as though they were old friends.<br><br>Or had he come to get a peek at her in her swimsuit? There was a twinkle in his eyes, or a nervous glitter, she wasn't sure which. The thought made her heart beat hard and fast in her chest.<br><br>“Who is that, Maisie?” asked Lise.<br><br>Maisie opened the door wider and pulled Ben inside. “Mr and Mrs Robbe, this is Ben. He's a writer too.”<br><br>“An intern for the Festival newsletter, that's all, I'm afraid,” Ben corrected, shaking their hands bashfully.<br><br>“And I'm a notorious pornographer,” Jean-Louis smiled. “No, correction – once notorious. We are neither of us proper writers yet but maybe one day, eh?”<br><br>“Pleasure to meet you, sir. I wouldn't want to bother you this evening as I know you're very busy, but maybe I could catch you for a brief interview sometime while you're here?”<br><br>“We have a book-signing tomorrow,” said Lise. “Come along afterwards.”<br><br>“If that wouldn't be any trouble?”<br><br>“No trouble at all, young man,” Jean-Louis chuckled. “We almost-writers should stick together.”<br><br>“Well, I hope you enjoy... everything,” said Maisie after they'd settled on a time.<br><br>“Actually, I'm still not quite sure what you're doing.”<br><br>“That makes two of us,” she confided to him.<br><br>He gave her a look that was sympathetic and wryly funny, then drifted off to the back row, his face becoming serious once again as he took out a pad and pen. No sooner had he gone, than Miss Tweedle appeared, looking flushed and excited. “We're sold out and they've already eaten all the cheese and pineapple. Think it's time to get started!”<br><br>Fingers crossed behind her back, she sallied forth to invite everyone to take their seats and to deliver a short, stumbling introduction.<br><br>Maisie watched all this numbly, only half-listening. She had thought she had just about gotten used to the idea that she was going to be parading around in very little clothing in front of a bunch of strangers. For some reason, though, the discovery that Ben was going to be here had set her all aquiver. What was it exactly she was feeling? Sheer terror? Or could it be a weird kind of pleasurable excitement? Hard to say, but whatever it was, it was making it very difficult to concentrate.<br><br>To polite applause, Jean-Louis was summoned out front to meet his audience. Lise wandered out after him and watched from the sidelines. Maisie stayed where she was. The first part of the talk would consist of Jean-Louis' reflections on his career, plus some readings from The Naked English Girl. She wasn't needed for that bit.<br><br>Because of the state of her nerves, Maisie found it hard to pay attention, but it was obvious even to her that Jean-Louis was being very charming. Sitting on a high stool in his crisp linen suit, with his open shirt collar, his healthy tan and his neatly combed silver hair, he looked the very image of a literary lion, belying his actual rather modest stature in the world of letters. Luckily, his hay fever didn't seem to be bothering him too much this evening.<br><br>“I'm aware of the heavy irony of giving a talk on how to write erotica when I haven't actually written any myself in twenty years. All I can say is, when it did happen for me, it happened in a trance. Experience was certainly important. Many of my books have elements of autobiography, I am not ashamed to admit that. But that alone wasn't enough. One other thing was key. In those days my muse, my lovely wife Lise, inspired me to such a pitch... I'd better not say how exactly... but we would stay up all night, and by the end of it I would have a first draught. Then I would edit, expand, move sections around; but that first draft was the foundation.”<br><br>On he went, drawing the audience into his world. Exactly because he made light of his situation so gallantly, Maisie felt sorry for him and became even more determined to do a good job when it was her turn to join him in the spotlight. She couldn't entirely forget Ben, though, and kept glancing his way. He was busy making notes, his face almost stern as he focussed on the pad on his knee.<br><br>“So it has happened that my work satisfies nobody. For some, ouff! Too much sex! For others, too little. For me, it is just right. Erotica is not about hard sex, after all. It's about an atmosphere of excited transgression, the sensations of the skin, the beauty of the female form. The man scarcely figures in my books, the woman is the key. I objectify women, but only to preserve what passes… didn't your Keats say a thing of beauty is a joy forever?”<br><br>After that, there was some general talk. It couldn't be long now...<br><br>“At this point, I want to do something different. We're used to artists drawing from the life, using a model as their inspiration. Tonight I want us all to try to do a little writing from the life, yes? Please welcome our model, the young lady who has been kind enough to assist us in our endeavour – Maisie, come on out, please.”<br><br>This was it. Even as he had been talking, Maisie had been slipping off her robe. Now, her heart in her mouth, she stepped out of the storeroom and sauntered, as coolly and confidently as she could manage, to a spot slightly to one side of where Jean-Louis was sitting. And there she stood, in nothing but her heels and a flimsy green and purple tropical print string bikini with tie-side briefs. There was complete silence.<br><br>Context was everything. She could have walked around like this at the beach and no one would have blinked. But this wasn't a beach, this was a literary talk in a bookshop in the centre of Dalchester. Literary talks weren't usually big on bikini babes. And a babe Maisie was, in her own quiet way – a body as slender as a moonbeam, not a whole lot of curves but enough to caress the eye, especially that swell of plump cleavage and those two scoops of smooth vanilla icecream that filled out the seat of her bikini bottoms so delectably. And all topped by a neat little face that seemed so innocent – round, doll-like eyes, flared nostrils, rosebud mouth – framed by fine, slightly wavy shoulder-length hair the colour of sun-warmed amber.<br><br>She tried to look at ease, relaxed, weight planted on one leg, the other knee slightly bent, hands at her sides.<br><br>Even though she was scared of what he might be thinking, she glanced across rows of curious faces to Ben, hoping for a look of support and reassurance, something to get her through what was sure to be a trying few minutes. To her surprise, his seat was empty.<br><br>He'd gone? That was quick. In a way, she was relieved. A source of anxiety had been alleviated. Yet she couldn't help feeling completely gutted too. Obviously she wasn't as irresistible as she thought. Maybe he'd had a deadline or something? Oh well...<br><br>Meanwhile Jean-Louis was gesturing towards her. “I look at Maisie and my head fills with questions. Who is this girl? What does she want? What is she feeling right now? What are you feeling right now, Maisie?”<br><br>“Um, nervous?” she responded in a tiny squeak that made the audience chuckle sympathetically.<br><br>“My own theory is that she wants to be here, that she enjoys flaunting her young body, it is a compulsion for her. Perhaps that says more about me than it does about Maisie. But the question is, what is her body telling us?”<br><br>Maisie, who had been staring as if hypnotized at Jean-Louis during this exchange, became aware of movement out of the corner of her eye. Ben was at the door, making whispered excuses to Miss Tweedle. So he hadn't darted out in a flash after all. But he was leaving now, and the sight of the door closing behind him triggered another swell of of confused feelings.<br><br>Buggered off without so much as a backward glance. Didn't he want to see her in her bikini? It wasn't like she had been eager to parade around in front of him, yet now he was gone she was no longer in quite the same state of high nervous excitement. The audience suddenly became slightly unreal to her, like a sea of cardboard cut-outs.<br><br>Jean-Louis was saying, “We look all the time for the detail that quickens the reader's blood.” He stood up and raised his hand to Maisie's neck. “The pulse in her throat. See the way the bikini strap lays across her collarbone? On either side there is a gap, a sweet aperture, a lover could slide his fingertip under so...” He did just that. At the touch of his smooth fingernail against her sensitive skin, her nipples stiffened against her bra, poking through the thin cups. He pulled his finger out again with an amiable smile. “What else? What do you see?”<br><br>Various hands went up. Christ, she hoped no one mentioned her nipples. Someone talked about the way her briefs sat snugly under her hipbones. Someone else mentioned how the side-ties were dangling against her hips and wondered if they felt tickly.<br><br>“The way she touches herself, touches her stomach and hips, I mean,” another voice volunteered. The audience were getting warmed to the task now.<br><br>Maisie blushed. She hadn't even realized she had been doing that! All this time she thought her hands had been at her sides. She'd have to keep a tighter control of herself.<br><br>Worried that her face must be looking red, she was grateful when Jean-Louis asked her to turn around.<br><br>“For me, the seat of the bikini bottoms is an object of eternal fascination. The way it cups the derriere, but not quite perfectly. A peep of cleft here, at the top, and following it down, here the flimsy material catches between the buttocks, and suddenly the briefs seem too small, and here and here, the cheeks escape, cheekily.”<br><br>As he described what he saw, Maisie felt Jean-Louis' words enfolding her, like a second skin that was more sensitive than her real one. It was almost like he was stroking her with his thoughts. Her pert little bottom tingled, aware of all eyes upon it. She was tortured by the urge to reach around and give her briefs a tug, freeing the fabric snagged between her cheeks that he had so acutely and so mercilessly drawn attention to. But that would be almost worse, performing such an intimate gesture in front of whole bunch of strangers. To say it would be an embarrassment was an understatement – it would be a total and utter surrender, bidding goodbye to any hint of self-respect.<br><br>Which was why she was completely aghast when her hand shot around and pinched the right leg-hole of her briefs between finger and thumb.<br><br>Equally as suddenly, strong, fleshy digits encircled her wrist, gently but securely, and her hand was trapped there, in place, for all to see.<br><br>“A girl tugs on her panties. For most writers, this is beneath notice. For the erotica writer, it is poetry, it is life itself, it is like the motions of the planets. Let us pause to celebrate this gesture – everyday, common but delightful. Note the position of her finger and thumb. So it begins. So this beautiful landscape of panties and buttocks will be rewritten.”<br><br>He released her hand. She tugged. The gesture felt exciting, momentous. The cold shivers had stopped and now she was having hot flushes. Her heart was racing, her breath came in excited snuffles.<br><br>Jean-Louis paused and cleared his throat. “Now I must ask the audience if you would be offended if Maisie took her top off.”<br><br>Take my top off? Who said anything about taking my top off? Her face hidden from the audience and Jean-Louis, Maisie gaped in alarm and swivelled her eyes to left and right in panic. Going topless wasn't part of the job description!<br><br>But then they had never been a proper job description, had there? Maisie had never dared ask – afraid, perhaps, to find out what she was getting into.<br><br>She stole a quick, resentful glance at Jean-Louis. Maybe he wasn't such a gentleman after all. He could at least have asked her if she minded going topless, rather than taking it for granted. Perhaps this was how he got his kicks – ambushing helpless females in public. More likely he hadn't even thought it was worth mentioning. He was acting so casually, it was like he was inviting her to take off her hat and coat.<br><br>Another moment passed. She threw a mute appeal in Lise's direction. The little Frenchwoman nodded firmly, standing – coincidentally or on purpose – between Maisie and the storeroom door, blocking her way just in case she felt inclined to bolt for the exit. As for the audience, if any of them had any profound objections, they were keeping it to themselves. On the contrary, they all seemed to be sitting forward in their seats eagerly.<br><br>Okay, it looked like the top was coming off. The only silver lining was that Ben would probably kick himself when he found out what he'd missed. With that cheering thought, she half-turned and reached behind her.<br><br>“Slowly, with pauses,” Jean-Louis murmured in soothing tones, almost crooning out the words, ”so we can follow your every movement. What do we notice now? The delicate posture of her hands. The tie caught between finger and thumb. Her shoulder-blades sliding together.” He was becoming more intense and alive, leaving the audience behind, almost forgetting they were there as he narrated what he saw. Maisie felt like she was glimpsing the real Jean-Louis Robbe at last. The thought that she had wrought this change in him was – be honest – strangely arousing.<br><br>He seemed to be able to read her mind. He paused. Laughed. “You see, even a burnt-out case such as I can become excited and feel a touch of the old creative frisson.”<br><br>He wasn't the only one. Suddenly emboldened, she released the tie and pulled the ends taut for a moment, delaying the moment when the cups would slip from her breasts. Then, with a flick of her hair, she lifted the top over her head, freeing her boobs, which bobbed on her narrow ribcage, the nipples visibly puffed up and as pale pink as cherry blossoms. She held the top away from her, allowing it to slither from between her finger and thumb onto the carpet, where it lay in a crumpled heap like a discarded bouquet of flowers.<br><br>After all the anxiety and anticipation, the nerves and the worry, it felt good to stop fighting and just give everyone what they wanted. She could breathe again. Her small, pointy tits swelled deliciously as she filled her lungs in relief.<br><br>She was only dimly aware that Jean-Louis was talking. Her ear picked out the occasional phrase, no more. He was speaking so fast and low, she wondered if the audience could make out what he was saying. But she didn't have to hear every word to know that his frisson had now turned into something close to rapture.<br><br>She was now fully facing front. Her eyes danced over the bookshop, trying to find a place to rest. The rows of chairs, the book-lined walls, the refreshments table, the street outside the shop window, darkening now. She didn't seem able to stop moving, to stop touching herself. Her arms rose to half-cover her breasts... which became a cupping gesture instead... then her fingers were interlaced behind her hot little neck. She smiled to herself. It was always like this when she got herself in these situations. Terror beforehand, but once she got going, there was something about exhibiting her tight little body to strangers which she found exhilarating and inexplicably moreish.<br><br>Then a nagging thought: what would her aunt say? Was this really how a bookseller should behave? But somehow the question was unreal. The only real thing was her need to see this through to its logical conclusion, to please Jean-Louis and Lise and Miss Tweedle. She met Jean-Louis' eyes, inviting him to take this to the next level.<br><br>The old man nodded gravely. His index finger made a circle in the air, instructing her to turn around. Then he addressed the audience, rubbing his hands.<br><br>“For me, there is no sight so luxurious as the sight of panties being pushed down a bottom. Smoothness against smoothness, it delights and relaxes me to contemplate it. The way the fabric bunches against her thumbs. A moment of supreme tension. Then they go down.”<br><br>Timing her actions to his words, Maisie began to ease off her bikini bottoms. A wiggle of her hips, and down they slid, inch by inch, revealing more and more of a rump that looked like a perfectly peeled apple. She couldn't see the audience's intense scrutiny, but she could feel it, striking sparks off her bare flesh. She could feel her pussy growing moist and swelling, itching for attention. Suddenly needing to hurry, she tipped forward at the waist and shoved the panties down over her hips. There was a humiliating moment as the gusset clung to her groin and the cleft of her behind. Then she quickly stepped out of the panties and righted herself, turning back towards the audience hot-faced and slightly giddy.<br><br>She clutched her panties in front of privates. Partly this was because she didn't want everyone to see how plumped up her labia were. Not that she didn't feel an urge to share this intimate revelation, but she didn't think Miss Tweedle's literary clientele would be able to take it. The other reason was that she was tormented by an urge to finger herself. She couldn't have dragged her hand away from her pussy even if she tried. Would Jean-Louis ask her to masturbate, to fondle herself? Christ, she hoped so – that is, she hoped not – God, she didn't know what she thought!<br><br>“Now we must release our Maisie. I believe she has given us a great deal this evening and we must be kind to her. A round of applause, if you please.”<br><br>The audience let go of their pads and pens to clap politely. Grabbing her bra and panties, Maisie darted for the storeroom like a scalded cat. She closed the door behind her and leaned against it, puffing out a deep sigh.<br><br>The room was in darkness. A cool draft came from the half-open back door. Perfect. She reached down to touch herself. Pent-up juices spilled from her pussy over her fingers. She moaned and threw back her head, half-closing her eyes.<br><br>Through her fluttering eyelashes, she noticed a coatstand in the corner of the room. It looked like a tall, thin man standing there in the twilight. Imagining that's exactly what it was, she cupped one nipple between her fingers and parted her slender white thighs as she delved deeper with her other hand.<br><br>“Come on, then, coatstand man,” she murmured throatily. “Want to see me frig myself silly?” She squeezed her eyes shut and gave herself up to pleasure. Then she remembered that, actually, there wasn't a coatstand in the corner of Miss Tweedle's office. And what was the back door doing open? In which case...<br><br>Her eyes snapped wide, just in time to see a dim figure slipping out through the door into the back alley.`

                    subtitle: "", 
                    content: `The next day Maisie still wasn't sure what she'd seen. Nor had she told anyone about her encounter, for various reasons. As the circumstances were embarrassing to say the least, she'd much prefer not to go into them if she didn't have to. And there didn't seem to be any pressing need. Once she'd turned on the lights and thrown on her robe, a brief check of the office had revealed no drawers broken into, no filing cabinets rifled. The coatstand man didn't seem to have been a very effective burglar. If in fact he'd been there at all. Maisie had started to wonder whether she'd imagined the whole thing – symptom of a guilty conscience perhaps. As for the door, the one incontrovertible piece of evidence, it could easily have been left open by mistake.<br><br>Upon reflection, she'd decided to wait until the following morning. If Miss Tweedle mentioned that anything was missing or not as it should be, then Maisie would speak up too, even if it meant telling the whole sorry tale of how she'd failed to notice the interloper because she'd been too, um, distracted.<br><br>In the event, even if Maisie had wanted to say anything, Miss Tweedle probably wouldn't have let her get a word in edgewise. She was having another one of her wild hair, hollow eye days worrying about the book launch. Jean-Louis was sitting dutifully behind a desk, ready for a busy book signing, but aside from the tiny figure of Lise curled up neatly in a corner in silk pyjamas, doing some embroidery, Heart's Desire was resoundingly empty of adoring fans.<br><br>Miss Tweedle checked Litstop and swore loudly, having discovered that a celebrity cook was doing a book signing in WH Smith's right at that very moment. “Damn, that must be where everyone is. Maybe we should postpone for an hour or two.”<br><br>For once, Jean-Louis showed a flash of anger. “I am not postponing because of a celebrity cook, especially not an English cook. I know I am no longer fashionable, but I have my pride!”<br><br>“Then how are we going to get the punters in? It's impossible for a proper author to compete with all these stupid people off the telly. I don't know what we can do, short of blocking off the street so they can't get to WH Smith's. What do you reckon, poppet?”<br><br>Miss Tweedle stopped pacing and suddenly looked straight at Maisie, inviting her to come up with a solution.<br><br>Maisie was stunned. Miss Tweedle had never shown the remotest interest in her opinion before. Could it be she was starting to take her more seriously, see her as more than just a pretty face? Determined to prove herself worthy, Maisie lifted a finger to her chin and knitted her brows. “I reckon there's only one thing we can do. We've got to find some way of drawing a crowd.”<br><br>“You mean like a new window display?” asked Lise, poking a needle into place, then glancing up.<br><br>“Yes, exactly.”<br><br>“But that's superb!” With a rustle of silk, Lise jumped up like a jack in a box from the low pouffe where she had been sitting cross-legged. “Hattie, Maisie has hit the nail on the head! That's exactly what we need, a new window display! Well done, Maisie!”<br><br>Bouncing up and down, the little Frenchwoman planted kisses on Maisie's cheeks. Maisie, who had the feeling she was getting the credit for something she didn't deserve, smiled uncertainly.<br><br>“Fine, I'm game,” said Miss Tweedle. “So we take out the books. What do we put in instead?”<br><br>Lise looked to Maisie for guidance, then shared a conspiratorial grin with her, completely to Maisie's confusion. The girl listened in bewilderment as Lise said, “No, no! No need to say a word! I know exactly what you're thinking, and it's brilliant. Hattie, you're going to love it. Let's recreate the cover of The Naked English Girl in the window, with a deckchair and a real naked girl.”<br><br>Maisie's mouth fell open. “A real naked girl?” But where are you going to get a...”<br><br>Then she stopped, not liking the way the two women were looking at her.<br><br>She held up her hands in horror and entreaty. “Miss Tweedle! I really don't think –“<br><br>Lise grabbed them with chubby little paws that were surprisingly strong and tenacious. “Trust me, it will be marvellous.”<br><br>“Please, Maisie. You're looking into the eyes of a desperate woman,” Miss Tweedle chimed in.<br><br>“But what about Aunt Barbara? What would she say?”<br><br>“I'll explain everything to her later. It's not like she can complain – you're doing this for art.”<br><br>As far as Maisie could tell, she would be doing this for Miss Tweedle's bank balance. But she nodded glumly. Why did everyone think it was no big deal for her, going naked?<br><br>Showing a rare turn of speed, Miss Tweedle nipped across the yard at the back to another shop to borrow a deckchair that had been used in a display the week before. Lise bundled Maisie into the office and shut the door behind them. It was the first time she had been back there since her brush with the unknown the night before, and she felt herself coming out in goosebumps. Then she yelped as Lise grabbed the little shift dress she was wearing and yanked it clean over her head, leaving her standing there in just her heels and a dainty white bra and panty set.<br><br>“I can undress myself, you know,” Maisie grumbled. But Lise was already unfastening her bra with deft fingers, snapping, “Vite! Vite!” Sighing and wondering why, unlike other girls her age, she found it so hard to keep her knickers on, Maisie resignedly pushed down her panties.<br><br>The door opened and Miss Tweedle stepped back in, her grin telling them her mission had been successfully accomplished.<br><br>“Are you sure this is legal?” Maisie asked, standing nervous and completely nude between the two ladies, doing her best to cover her quivering pink parts with her arms. “I mean, I don't want to get arrested or anything.”<br><br>“It'll be fine. There's a festival going on. The usual rules go out the window.”<br><br>“And the naked girl goes in the window,” said Lise brightly. Pulling Maisie's arm away from her breasts, she rubbed lotion into them with a quick patting motion that was all the more intimate for being so casual, then refreshed her lipstick and ran a comb through her hair. As a final touch she planted a sunhat and sunglasses on Maisie's head. Maisie couldn't help reflecting that, considering this was supposed to be a spur of the moment thing, they seemed awfully well prepared. Could they have been planning this all along?<br><br>The two women steered her across the still-empty shop towards the window display, which had been cleared of its clutter, and where the deckchair now sat at an angle, awaiting her. Jean-Louis' desk had been placed with its back to where Maisie would be sitting. This meant that the customers, should they arrive, would be able to gawp at her both from from the street and while they queued to have their book signed.<br><br>“You don't think we should just postpone till a better time?” pleaded Maisie, digging in her heels.<br><br>“Nonsense!” Lise shoved her forward. “Keep your hat pulled down over your face, if you're worried about people recognizing you.”<br><br>It didn't seem like the most helpful of suggestions, but in lieu of any better advice, she did just just that, burying her chin in her chest and tilting the hat down over her eyes as she settled into the deckchair. Lise handed her a copy of The Naked English Girl. She immediately opened it wide and held it in front of her face, carefully positioning her forearms so that they hid her nipples. Her legs were tightly crossed in an effort to ensure that passers-by wouldn't be able to see that she went completely hairless down below. It wasn't an entirely comfortable pose, but it could have been much worse, exposure-wise.<br><br>All the same Maisie's heart was in her mouth. This is insane. How did I let myself be talked into this? she wondered, aghast at her own foolishness. It was one thing to model nude, as she had done last night, for a select group who could be relied upon to behave themselves, quite another stripping off in front of the general public. Who knew how they could react, what they would do, or what the fall-out might be?<br><br>On top of that, it was stiflingly hot in the window. Caught in the full glare of the sun, she felt like a chicken in an oven. She prayed for clouds. Instead, she got crowds.<br><br>As though the sight of her had somehow robbed them of the use of their legs, people began to collect in front of the window, sticking to the pavement like flies to flypaper. Chuckling Asian tourists, sweaty shoppers clutching carrier bags, people on the way to or from work, parents with kids, there they stopped, some grinning, some slack-faced, all groping for their smartphones. Miss Tweedle bobbed among them, taking photos with a small digital camera.<br><br>With mounting alarm, Maisie witnessed all this through her sunglasses, which granted her a modicum of privacy and allowed her to observe everything that was going on even as she pretended to be absorbed in her book, turning over a new leaf at regular intervals.<br><br>Every now and then she would get uncomfortable and have to uncross her legs and cross them again the other way. Catching onto this, a slim, artsy-looking teenage girl stood there patiently with the lens of her Flip camcorder trained on Maisie's crotch. Maisie was willing to bet that that particular bit of footage was going to wind up on the Internet, playing in ultra slo-mo.<br><br>Yet while some of the crowd just stood and gawped, a fair few were decent enough to come inside, see what was going on and buy a copy of the book. Sitting just off to her right, Jean-Louis was kept busy doing signings, and there was a steady crackle of camera flashes as people took photos and selfies with the author, with naked Maisie forming the backdrop. People who had never heard of him before suddenly wanted to know who Jean-Louis Robbe was. By now those intimidating piles of paperbacks she and Miss Tweedle had unpacked yesterday must surely be looking less steep.<br><br>Then, peering out through her sunglasses over the top edge of her book, Maisie suddenly noticed something that made her blood run cold: a police uniform among the throng.<br><br>A pretty young female constable was staring in at her, eyes narrowed, lips drawn in a thin, tight line, one hand on her utility belt, the other on her walkie talkie, as if poised to call in a case of flagrant public disorder.<br><br>Maisie blenched. If she hadn't been frozen with fear she would have bolted from the deckchair. She jumped as a hand touched her bare shoulder. It was only Miss Tweedle, leaning in to reassure her. “Don't worry, poppet, I'll handle this.”<br><br>Miss Tweedle hurried outside to engage the constable in conversation. All the time they were talking, the girl in uniform kept her eyes locked on Maisie. The way she was fingering the end of her baton was enough to make Maisie feel faint with terror. The slim redhead heaved a sigh of relief when the constable finally went on her way.<br><br>“There we go,” Miss Tweedle returned and whispered into her ear. “All sorted. She said we can have another ten minutes.”<br><br>“How did you get rid of her?” Maisie whispered back.<br><br>“She's one of my regulars, always having a nose around the lezdom section. Anyway, she agreed to turn a blind eye so long as you would go out on a date with her.”<br><br>“What?” Maisie wailed.<br><br>“Shush! Stay in character. Anyway, I gave her your number. Expect a call.”<br><br>Maisie buried her face in The English Naked Girl, stifling a moan. Pimped out to a butch WPC! Could this week get any worse? Still, look on the bright side – at least now she knew that she only had another ten minutes to go before she could experience the bliss of wearing clothes again. And while she was counting her blessings, it was a bloody good thing that Ben hadn't turned up early and seen her flaunting herself – that would have been totally galling! What if he'd taken a photo and published it on Litstop, where her auntie might have seen it? No, don't think about it … Christ, she was sure she was going to get it in the neck from Aunt Barbara for this.<br><br>When the ten minutes was up, Miss Tweedle tucked a shawl around Maisie's shoulders and helped her to her feet. The crowd's phones jumped into action smartly. The shawl left Maisie's lower body bare and for a moment, as she struggled to get up, they had a nice view of her baby-smooth cleft, followed by her perky little backside and another glimpse of plump labia from the rear. She came down off the deckchair trembling but excited, and darted as quickly as she could into the office, cameras crackling in her wake.<br><br>“We've shifted fifty copies, that's one for every two minutes you were up there!” Miss Tweedle had followed her into the office, beaming. “Took some brilliant photos too. Look!”<br><br>Given that she hadn't even had a chance to put her knickers on yet, Maisie wasn't really in the mood for admiring amateur photography. But, clutching the shawl about her, she glanced politely at the back of the camera while Miss Tweedle shuffled through the shots she'd taken. She recoiled as she got an eyeful of bare flesh – her own, which only made it worse.<br><br>“Well, I never said I was David Bailey,” snapped Miss Tweedle, sensitive as ever.<br><br>“No, they're … er … very artistic. Just please don't show them to Auntie Barbara.”<br><br>“Why not? She's as artistic as they come, that one.”<br><br>“I suppose. But she's also my aunt. It would make me feel funny.”<br><br>“So she gives you bed and board and she's the only one who doesn't get to see you with your clothes off? Doesn't seem very fair.”<br><br>Maisie's sugary little mouth opened into a perfect oval of outrage. But before she could think of a cutting reply, Miss Tweedle peeped out through the door, which was still a few inches ajar, and remarked airily, “Hello, here's your friend Ben.”<br><br>“Oh lord! Don't show him the pictures either!”<br><br>Miss Tweedle shook her head, as though to suggest that it was hard work dealing with such a diva, then trotted off, patting at her wiry hair. Maisie closed the door behind her and treated herself to a heartfelt sigh.<br><br>She couldn't face seeing Ben, not until she had her clothes back on and had had a chance to calm down a bit.<br><br>By the time Maisie had slid back into her sundress, the hubbub outside had subsided. Just like that, it seemed, the shop had cleared, as people remembered that they had other places they needed to be on this busy Festival week.<br><br>Hearing Ben's soft, pleasant voice, she couldn't resist opening the door a crack and peering out. He and Jean-Louis were sitting down in the now-quiet bookshop.<br><br>“So, Mr Robbe, you've spoken eloquently about the importance of a muse, and how your wife Lise inspired many of your novels. But I can't help wondering, are any of your books autobiographical? Do they draw on any of your own experiences? The Naked English Girl for instance?”<br><br>“It is interesting that you should ask that. In most of my stories, there is probably more fantasy than autobiography, truth be told. But The Naked English Girl is different. It was based on an actual affair I had with a very beautiful young lady from your country. It is okay to mention this because Lise and I were on a break at the time. She knows everything and she is not jealous. Isn't that so, my darling?”<br><br>“Maybe a little bit jealous,” Lise laughed.<br><br>“A little jealous,” he grinned. “But the point is, there, where I had fact to draw upon, I tried to be truthful to it. Ah, excuse me.”<br><br>Jean-Louis grabbed a Kleenex and wiped his nose. The pollen count was apparently bothering him again today.<br><br>Ben lowered his eyes politely and then asked another question. Maisie was impressed by how serious and professional he was being. Not that she was totally paying attention. Maybe it was something to do with the way her nerves were all jangled from her long bout of nudity, but she couldn't help gazing at his lean shoulders in his tight-fitting Dalchester Literature Festival T-shirt, the play of muscles in his arm as he made notes.<br><br>Patting his long, regal nose with a flesh Kleenex, Jean-Louis continued to answer every question with charm and honesty, until Lise called him away to take a phone call from France. Maisie was just about to nip out and say hello when she noticed Ben doing something weird while the elderly writer's back was turned. Surreptitiously, he reached out towards Jean-Louis' crumpled Kleenex, which was sitting there forgotten on the table, and palmed it. His hands hidden under the table, he wrapped in inside a clean tissue, then slid both into his trouser pocket.<br><br>What the...? Why would anyone steal a soggy tissue? She was stumped for an explanation. All she could think was that Ben was a keen collector of literary memorabilia. Or maybe he was hoping to sell it on eBay. After all, he was just an unpaid intern, perhaps he needed the cash. But would Jean-Louis Robbe's used tissue really have any kind of resale value?<br><br>She was still pondering this conundrum when he turned and spotted her. He started, looking guilty. She reassured him with a smile and a wave.<br><br>“Hi. How's the interview going?”<br><br>“Great. He's just on the phone.”<br><br>It seemed cruel to mention the tissue, so she said nothing.<br><br>Miss Tweedle wandered up. “You missed some fun earlier, Ben. Maisie's just been –”<br><br>“Selling books,” Maisie cut in quickly. “Selling, selling.”<br><br>“Well, you are a bookseller.”<br><br>“Exactly.” Her phone bleeped, telling her she'd received a text. She checked it and pulled a face. “That was quick!”<br><br>“What was?”<br><br>“Oh, I've been set up on a date.”<br><br>She was satisfied to see that Ben didn't look at all pleased.<br><br>“With another woman,” she added.<br><br>“Oh?” Now he looked intrigued. He was a normal guy after all.<br><br>“Jean-Louis' waiting.” she pointed out. And indeed the author had finished his call and was now sitting, ready to resume the interview and dabbing his nose with another collectible tissue.<br><br>“Did you say something about a date?” Miss Tweedle said to Maisie. “Not tonight, I hope. Everything's gone so well, I'm having a little celebratory dinner. I'm counting on you being there.”<br><br>Maisie had been looking forward to having some free time again, but she nodded agreeably. A celebratory dinner couldn't hurt.`

                    content: `After all she'd been through, Maisie thought she was well within her rights to expect a slap-up meal at a nice restaurant, with the wine flowing. She was therefore decidedly underwhelmed to learn that Miss Tweedle would be cooking for them and that they would be eating in her little flat above Heart's Desire.<br><br>Given how little care Miss Tweedle took of herself, Maisie worried that the flat would be plain and untidy and the food likewise. In fact, she was surprised, that evening, to find herself in an attractive double-aspect room decorated in antique bordello style. There were erotic prints on the walls, a small round mahogany dining table at one end, a plush Victorian chaise longue and two matching chairs at the other. In the middle was a broad, leather-topped desk.<br><br>Off this room were a tiny bedroom, a bathroom and a galley kitchen whence some delicious smells were emanating.<br><br>Apparently Miss Tweedle was serving some Provencal dishes in the Robbes' honour. Jean-Louis was in there with her to see how she was doing, and to judge by the happy noises he was making, they were on course for a tasty supper.<br><br>That left Maisie alone in the lounge with Lise, who pressed a large glass of red wine into her hand and drew her away to stand among the heavy velvet furniture.<br><br>“You look more beautiful than ever tonight, my dear,” Lise observed. She spoke, not to flatter, but with the acuteness of an experienced ex-model, turning Maisie by the elbow so that she could admire the line of her back, bare to well below the shoulder-blades.<br><br>“Why, thank you,” Maisie preened. Restaurant or not, she had pulled out all the stops. She looked sleek and tidy in a short, strappy Desigual slip dress in a bold chrysanthemum print, with her hair up in chignon. And why not? It was every day she dined with a famous author – or once famous, soon to be famous again, fingers crossed.<br><br>“Listen, little one, you have done much for us already, but I need to ask one more favour of you. You know Hattie gave us money for a new book? We would return it if we could, but regrettably we can't. It's killing Jean-Louis, not to be able to do this, it makes him feel like an old man. So it's for his sake – and also for Hattie's, so she'll have something to show for her investment, something to sell – it would be nice if, before we go home, she could announce on your friend's website that a new Jean-Louis Robbe novel will be published very shortly.”<br><br>“I couldn't agree more, Lise. But what can I do to help?”<br><br>&nbsp; “Isn't it obvious? It stares us in the face, no?” Lise reached up one heavily ringed hand to stroke Maisie's cheek. Her crackling little voice lowered itself to an urgent whisper. “I want you to do for him what I used do. I want you to be his muse.”<br><br>Maisie recoiled. “Me? Oh Lise, I couldn't.”<br><br>The hand dropped to her shoulder, holding her firm. “Yes, you can. I saw his eyes when he looked at you last night. You bring out the spark in him.”<br><br>“But how –?”<br><br>At this point Jean-Louis came bustling in. Maisie was left to wonder exactly what Lise had in mind. Soon they were sitting down, enjoying a Salade Nicoise and a bottle of rosé. There was only just enough room at the table for the four of them – which perhaps explained why her aunt hadn't been invited, and hadn't been surprised that she hadn't – and the atmosphere was cosy and informal. Much to her astonishment, Miss Tweedle was an excellent cook. As always when she was in the presence of good food, Maisie forgot her worries and gave herself over to the simple pleasure of clearing her plate. Only eventually, when they were on the dessert, did she notice that the conversation had reverted to the topic of muses.<br><br>Lise was saying, “Do you remember all those times, Jean-Louis, when you would be, what is the word, stumped, and I, I spent all night flaunting my body, describing my deepest fantasies?”<br><br>“And in the morning, I had a novel.” Jean-Louis chuckled fondly at the memory. “Golden years. Not that I do not still find you a constant inspiration, my love.” He lifted her bejewelled little paw, pressing it lightly and fondly to his fleshy lips. Their eyes sparkled at one another over the table.<br><br>So sweet! Maisie sighed to herself, spoon halfway to her mouth. They were still so obviously in love.<br><br>“But it is a new era. For that you need a new inspiration.” Lise looked at Jean-Louis with solemn eyes, then turned to curl her heavy lips invitingly at Maisie, who immediately wished she'd kept her head down. “I have seen how alive you have been around this young girl. I believe she can do for you what I no longer can.”<br><br>Jean-Louis nodded his big, noble head good-humouredly. “Maybe one day, perhaps, on a return visit to this delightful English town.”<br><br>“No, now, while you have this connection between you. Do you not agree, Hattie?”<br><br>“What, do an all-nighter, like back in the old days?” Miss Tweedle, who had been knocking back the wine and looked a little red in the face as a result, gave a splutter of laughter. “Well, why not, if everyone's game? I've certainly got enough snacks and booze to last us till dawn.”<br><br>Lise sapped her beringed hand down on the little round table, making the glasses and plates vibrate. “Then it is agreed! You will write! Maisie will be your muse!”<br><br>The French lady smiled at Maisie, who looked down at her pudding, having suddenly lost every bit of her appetite. I would never have come to dinner if I'd known that flaunting was on the menu, she reflected miserably. And what was being suggested seemed especially abnormal. Stripping off in front of Jean-Louis, while Lise and Miss Tweedle watched? She'd rather be back in the shop window. But she couldn't see any way out. Once again events had snowballed beyond her control, and her throat had closed up, preventing her from uttering so much as a squeak of protest. She glanced up sheepishly.<br><br>“Don't be scared,” said Lise soothingly, pulling her to her feet. “You will help create great literature, yes?”<br><br>Was The Naked English Girl great literature? Well, it was no time to split hairs. She gave a resigned nod.<br><br>“Excellent!” Lise squeezed her arms, then ushered her husband over to the desk and sat him down behind it. Miss Tweedle put an A4 writing pad down in front of him.<br><br>“No, no, no lines,” he said, pushing it away impatiently. “Loose blank sheets only. I cannot be confined.”<br><br>The tetchiness, Maisie guessed, was a symptom of fright. He, she realized, was being put on the spot just as much as she was, perhaps even more so. The thought went some way towards placing her own problems in perspective.<br><br>Scurrying around, Miss Tweedle dumped a sheaf of blank printer paper in front of Jean-Louis, and a selection of pens from which he chose a thick felt-tip. He clicked the pen-top off and on nervously. Beads of sweat were collecting in the folds of his impressive brow.<br><br>“Come, you must tempt him, you must bring him out of himself.”<br><br>Lise frogmarched Maisie across the carpet until she was standing before the waiting author. She hooked her fingers under the girl's shoulder straps and was about to push them down. Then stopped. “It is better if you do it.”<br><br>Maisie nodded. Reached for the straps. Then hesitated. Was Jean-Louis a boob man? Perhaps it would be better to start lower down? If she was going to do this, she might as well do it right. The last thing she wanted was for her and Jean-Louis to put themselves through all this for nothing.<br><br>Standing in profile to Jean-Louis, she teasingly lifted her skirt a little on one side. Let's see how he reacts to a flash of lacy purple panties. The results were promising. All at once his eyes seemed to snap into focus and he gripped his pen with a new sense of readiness.<br><br>She swivelled on her heels, trailing the skirt through her fingers, unveiling the lower curves of her juicy little derriere. The smallest of jiggles, not so much that it would be obvious, but enough to draw attention to the pertness of her creamy white cheeks, and the way the flimsy, near transparent material clung to their every contour seamlessly.<br><br>A faint squeaking sound. Jean-Louis had begun to poke at the page with the felt-tip, spasmodically at first, then picking up speed. Maisie smiled to herself. Lise and Miss Tweedle exchanged a glance of triumph. Not for the first time, she wondered if they'd been plotting something like this all along. Not that it mattered. If she were honest, there was a part of her that quite liked being taken advantage … got off on it even. It was one way of making life interesting, wasn't it?<br><br>“Would you like to undo my hair?”<br><br>Moving round his desk, she bent forward at the waist, showing Jean-Louis the back of her slender neck.<br><br>The author dropped his pen and fumbled with her chignon. Her hair fell loose in a sheet of glimmering tangerine shades. He played with the fine strands, enjoying the feel of them on his fingers. He looked pained when she flicked her hair away, righting herself. But almost immediately she made it up to him by resting both palms on the leather writing top. The pose stretched her forward, sliding the tight little dress up to the very tops of her thighs. The invitation was clear.<br><br>Large brown hands alighted on her waist. Jean-Louis pushed the flimsy printed fabric up over her hips, baring her panties.<br><br>“Smoothness against smoothness,” she quoted, as fingertips plucked at her briefs and guided them down the slopes of her backside. Her flesh tingled. She had to admit, she was quite getting into writing.<br><br>Her panties were now down over her knees. Her bottom had never looked lovelier, taut as a drum, flawless as twin pearls, framed like a work of art by the shiny folds of the frock up around her waist and the whisky-red hues of the old writing desk. He took it gently in his hands and buried his face in it.<br><br>Oh wow! She hadn't been expecting that! Aware that Jean-Louis' wife was watching intently, she tried to keep a straight face, but she couldn't stop her back from arching like that of a cat being tickled in its favourite spot and her hips from grinding against the edge of the desk. Jean-Louis snorted, then exhaled, his breath buffeting her most intimate parts.<br><br>Who would have thought he had it in him? And with Lise looking on too? But even as these thoughts flitted through her mind, Maisie realized that what he was doing was more than just sexual. He was breathing in her essence. Taking in her youth and beauty in one great gulp. Filling his lungs with something that was as essential to him as oxygen. Or at least she hoped that was what he was doing, and he wasn't just some sad old bum-sniffer.<br><br>Jean-Louis sat back, sighing, his eyes sunken in thought. Was it over? Maisie glanced at Lise, who was topping up Miss Tweedle's wine glass for the umpteenth time. The little Frenchwoman signalled her to go on. Feeling slightly weak-kneed, Maisie slipped off her heels, disentangled her panties from around her ankles and tossed them casually aside. They landed on a red lampshade fringed with tassels.<br><br>He was scribbling again – squeak, squeak, squeak. Maisie's skirt was still rumpled around her waist. She didn't bother to pull it down. She was in that state of euphoria that she always seemed to enter into sooner or later whenever she stripped off. Self-assurance wasn't something she had a great deal of usually, but she had confidence in the appeal of her nude form as an object. If the idea was to get a new novel out of Jean-Louis, surely she had the goodies to make it happen. Resting her bare bottom on the desk, she watched him until he slowed and stopped, seemingly running out of inspiration. Then she swung one smooth, slender knee against his, parting her legs invitingly wide.<br><br>Straying from the page, his eyes followed the line of her milky inner thigh up to her smooth, hairless mound with its honey-moist cleft. Then they rose still further as she hiked the dress over her head in a swift, impulsive movement, tossing it into one of Miss Tweedle's ancient velvet chairs. He smiled fondly, eyeing her pointy little bust.<br><br>There, there had to be a paragraph at least in that. Sure enough, he started scrawling away once more, dots, dashes and squiggles flying from his pen. Maisie nodded to herself with satisfaction, then glanced at Lise and Miss Tweedle. They had flopped down on the sofa with a plate of snacks between them, as though settling down to an evening's telly. Miss Tweedle was giggling with happiness at the sight of Jean-Louis with a writing implement in his hand.<br><br>Things seemed to be going pretty well. Deciding that she had earned a treat, Maisie padded, naked, across the room and poured herself a glass of wine.<br><br>“You have what I would call a smiling bottom,” Jean-Louis observed, looking up.<br><br>Twisting at the waist, Maisie peeked at her rump complacently. She was getting to the stage where any reference to her nudity gave her a little thrill.<br><br>“No boyfriend though?”<br><br>I've got my eye on someone,” she answered, thinking of Ben.<br><br>He leaned forward on his elbows, peering at her shrewdly. ”Or maybe you're in love with yourself? Who could blame you?”<br><br>“Maybe,” Maisie agreed, sipping the wine. “Whatever suits your story best, Jean-Louis.”<br><br>The pen scratched, then stopped. “I see you... where do I see you? A beach? A hotel? A spa?”<br><br>“Oh yes, a spa, being pampered.”<br><br>“Good. But don't stop there. I want to know everything about you. Who are you? What do you feel? What do you want?”<br><br>She didn't know quite what to say. She never tried to articulate what was inside her, but she was like a cat really; she just wanted a cosy home, she liked to be petted and made a fuss of; she thought of herself as willing and good-natured, but she was aware of a kind of tenuousness in her connections with other people that made it easy for her to walk away when it suited her. She couldn't tell him that though.<br><br>“Sorry, Jean-Louis, I was hoping you could tell me. I'm just a bookseller really, or at least that's what I want to be.”<br><br>“Maisie, for this to work, I need to be close to you.”<br><br>“Fine. How's this?”<br><br>Emboldened by the wine, she climbed onto the desk and knelt with one knee either side of Jean-Louis' untidy mound of papers.<br><br>Now stop asking stupid questions and lose yourself in all this beautiful bare flesh. That's what she willed him to do, and it seemed to work. Something clicked at last. He clung to her thigh as he wrote, glancing up every now and then to stare straight at her holy of holies for inspiration.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” said Lise quietly.<br><br>“Was that how it was for the two of you?” Miss Tweedle asked her.<br><br>“I can't really remember, I was high the whole time. Is he writing?”<br><br>“Yes, he's writing,” Maisie told them. Words, lots of words, were forming under his pen. But not, perhaps, complete sentences.<br><br>“No, no.” He screwed up what he had written and threw it away. He tore out his hair. “I am too old. I do not understand you, I do not see you. You are a muse, but not my muse. You are for another.”<br><br>“No, Jean-Louis,” Lise shrilled. “The night is still young. You must not give up now.”<br><br>Jean-Louis slapped down his pen in disgust, planted his elbows on the table and bowed down, his head almost between Maisie's legs, forgetting she was there for the moment.<br><br>Maisie sat back on her heels, full of sympathy but uncertain what to do.<br><br>The author looked up at her from under his feathery grey brows. “Maybe if I can't write about you, I can write on you.”<br><br>He grabbed her wrist and pulled. The next moment she found herself stretched out on her back on his desk, her legs dangling over the side, the chilly texture of old morocco leather under her shoulder-blades and rump and a smell of beeswax reaching her nose. He lay the sheaf of printer paper on her flat tummy.<br><br>“We begin again, yes?”<br><br>She nodded, gave him an encouraging smile.<br><br>Jean-Louis took a deep breath. He muttered to himself, praying to the patron saint of erotica writers perhaps, if there was such a thing. Then he put his felt-tip pen to the blank page awaiting him and began driving it furiously from side to side, down and down. Maisie felt the weight of his fist on her navel, the force of his... probably not inspiration, but certainly determination. His other hand fondled her breast as he worked, the way someone else might clutch a prized good luck charm.<br><br>There was a deathly quiet in Miss Tweedle's bordello-style parlour. No one dared move for fear of breaking Jean-Louis' concentration. He called for strong black coffee, and while that was being served, Maisie turned over onto her front and propped her head on her folded arms. Jean-Louis drained his coffee cup, smacked his lips, eyes blinking rapidly. He hunched over her, sheaf of loose leaf paper on her bottom, heavy forearm draped across the small of her back.<br><br>He worked and worked.<br><br>Maisie made herself comfortable and drifted off to sleep.`

                    content: `The next morning, Maisie awoke to find herself still sprawled face-down on the desk. As she stirred, something – lots of somethings – slithered off her. She swung her feet to the floor and stretched her arms above her head to work a kink out of her neck. Only then did she notice the papers lying around her on the floor, every one covered from top to bottom with a large looping scrawl.<br><br>Jean-Louis's new book! She would have cried out in delight, if not for the eerie stillness of the room. Everyone else was still out for the count – Jean-Louis slumped back in his chair, ink-stained fingers folded over his paunch; Lise and Miss Tweedle collapsed together on the chaise longue.<br><br>Dropping to her knees, Maisie gathered up the pages. They were out of order, but they were numbered. There seemed to be well over a hundred. She was no expert but it looked like a lot of words. A novel's worth? Perhaps, at least one of the shortish ones that Jean-Louis wrote.<br><br>She tingled with excitement. The moment didn't seem quite real. Kneeling there naked, surrounded by these slumbering figures, she felt as if she wasn't quite awake herself, a figure of dreams. Patting the manuscript into shape, she padded silently on tiptoe over to the window, meaning to take a closer look at it.<br><br>She tried to ease back the curtain a little way. The stiff loops resisted, then jerked back more sharply than she had intended, casting a shaft of light across the two women, who snorted and opened their eyes.<br><br>“Did he do it?”<br><br>“Of course I did.” Their bellows had roused the author. He grinned at Maisie. “All thanks to your delightful rump. It spoke to me like a seashell.”<br><br>Maisie smiled vaguely, not quite sure what to make of the compliment. Glancing at the manuscript, she noticed something that caused her thin, pretty eyebrows to shoot up. “Jean-Louis, did you write it in English?”<br><br>“As a tribute to you, Maisie, and to this beautiful country and to my brave publisher. There might be a few infelicities, but they can be corrected umph-...”<br><br>“Umph” because his face was being smothered in kisses from Lise, who, having gotten over her initial surprise, had hurled herself across the room on her little legs to congratulate him.<br><br>“English, French, who cares!” Miss Tweedle was pumping her pudgy fists in triumph. “I just can't believe you actually wrote something, anything. What's it about? Let me see.”<br><br>“No.” Jean-Louis held up an inky hand. “Maisie and her delightful bottom inspired it; it's only fitting that she should be the first to read it.”<br><br>Maisie's sugary little mouth gaped open. “Me? Really?”<br><br>“Yes, if you will be so kind.”<br><br>A glance at the faces of the two other women apprised her of the enormity of the honour. His first novel in twenty years, and she would be the first to read it!<br><br>“Jean-Louis, I don't know what to say. I'm really touched.” The manuscript made a crunching sound as she hugged it tightly to her breasts.<br><br>“Why don't we put that in a folder for safekeeping?” said Miss Tweedle, anxiously prising it away from her and straightening the pages.<br><br>“Well,” Lise spoke with satisfaction, “this calls for a celebratory breakfast. Some tea and toast and English marmalade!”<br><br>“Good idea,” said Miss Tweedle. “I'll put the kettle on. Maisie, would you set the table?”<br><br>“Okay, er, where are my clothes?<br><br>“I hung them up. Don't worry about them for now. We've all gotten so used to you being naked all the time, none of us think anything of it.”<br><br>That was all very well for them, but Maisie hadn't gotten used to it, not in the least. Nonetheless, she obediently padded off to the kitchen to fetch some knives and plates. She was just placing them on the dining table when she happened to glance out of the window down into the street and backed away sharply.<br><br>“Miss Tweedle, who are all those people outside?”<br><br>“People? What people?” Miss Tweedle set down the teapot and took Maisie's place at the window. She saw what Maisie had seen – a crowd (well, almost a crowd; it was no more than ten or twelve strong really) gathered outside Heart's Desire, eagerly squashing their noses against the plate glass.<br><br>“What are they doing?”<br><br>“Isn't it obvious?” Miss Tweedle's plump face wore a strange expression Maisie had never seen on it before – an expression of complete vindication. “Our publicity blitz has finally paid off! Word's gotten round! They're Jean-Louis' fans!”<br><br>By now, Jean-Louis and Lise were at the window too, peering down incredulously.<br><br>Miss Tweedle frowned. “What I can't understand is what they're doing here so early. Unless –“ She glanced at her watch. “Shit! Quarter past nine! We'll have to skip breakfast, I'd better go down and open up!”<br><br>“I will come too,” said Jean-Louis firmly. He brushed back his hair, straightened his lapels, dabbed his cheeks and the back of his neck with some cologne that Lise produced from her handbag. “I'm ready to meet my public and sign a few more books.”<br><br>“I can come back and help later,” said Maisie, “but would you mind if I went off and rested for a couple of hours, Miss Tweedle? I'm zonked.”<br><br>“That's fine, plus you need to read Jean-Louis' book asap and get it back to me.”<br><br>Miss Tweedle handed Maisie the manuscript. She had put it in an old scrap folder with faded pink covers tied shut with a red ribbon. “Whatever you do, don't lose it!”<br><br>“Will do! I mean, absolutely not!”<br><br>While the others hurried down, Maisie went to put on her dress. By the time she followed them downstairs, Jean-Louis was surrounded by his fans, who seemed even more impressively crowd-like now they were surging about indoors. Fans? Maisie half-suspected they were just people who had heard something on social media about the shop's recent escapades, and had come to check the place out for themselves, in case they were some more naked girls hanging around. Fearful of being roped into another display of bare flesh, Maisie kept her head down and slipped quietly out of the front door.<br><br>She couldn't resist a backwards peek. Tall and distinguished, Jean-Louis played the part of the author so well, when he was given half a chance. And the fact that she had helped to give him that chance – surely that was something she could be proud of? Even if it had meant taking all her clothes off and humiliating herself...<br><br>“Hey, thought I'd run into you here. But you look like you're going, not coming.”<br><br>She turned to find Ben smiling at her. He scratched his stubble and hitched his canvas bag onto one thin shoulder. “Fancy a coffee?”<br><br>One bat of his big, long-lashed eyes, and she ditched her plan to go home and crash. It would be nice to spend a bit of time in the company of someone her own age.<br><br>“What's that interesting-looking folder thingy?” he asked a few minutes later when they were sitting down in a nearby cafe over savoury croissants and mugs of frothy latte.<br><br>“Jean-Louis' new novel,” she told him reverently as she gobbled her breakfast. “I was his muse.”<br><br>“How did that work?”<br><br>“How...?” Maisie choked on a crumb of pastry. “Well, I – just, er, inspired him... generally... You know, the normal muse stuff.” Idiot, why hadn't she thought before she'd spoken? Ben seemed easy-going enough, but she wasn't sure how he would react if he found out she'd been taking her clothes off yet again. She cleared her throat. “Anyway, I've got the only copy and I'm going to be the first person to read it.”<br><br>“Big responsibility. What if it's a load of old poo? What will you tell him?”<br><br>She stared at him, crestfallen. “Oh lord, I hadn't thought of that! That would be terrible. It might give him a heart attack or something. I hate it when I do that to old people.”<br><br>“Not to worry. It's bound to be amazing, with you as the whatchamercallit.”<br><br>He was probably just saying it, but the compliment went a long way towards cheering her up. She leaned forward confidentially. “It'd make a juicy piece of gossip for your site though, wouldn't it? Sources close to the author reveal that the twenty year wait for a new Jean-Louis Robbe novel might soon be over.”<br><br>“Definitely.”<br><br>“You can use that word for word, if you like.”<br><br>“Thanks.”<br><br>She sat back. Miss Tweedle would be proud of her for plugging the book so quickly. “And just think, when they hear what it's done for Jean-Louis, lots of other authors will want to come to the Festival too.”<br><br>Ben said nothing. As he glanced at her over his coffee mug, his wry expression seemed to suggest that the obliteration of Jean-Louis Robbe's writer's block had less to do with the Festival than with a certain redhead sitting not too far away from him. Then it was his turn to clear his throat. “Can I ask you a personal question?”<br><br>“Sure. I'm an open book.”<br><br>“No, seriously, tell me if I'm out of line?”<br><br>She nodded and waved for him to continue.<br><br>“It's just, doing things like the talk, you know, the modelling? Is it nerve-racking, or does it get you, er... hot under the collar?”<br><br>“I wasn't wearing a collar.”<br><br>“Yeah, so I remember. Vividly.”<br><br>She wasn't quite sure how it was that they found themselves back at her place. As she'd hoped, her aunt wasn't there – she'd already gone off to open up the bookshop. They kissed and cuddled inside the front door, on the stairs. Finally they made it to her little bedroom.<br><br>He started to unbuckle his belt.<br><br>“What are you doing?” she asked.<br><br>“Bad manners to make love with your trousers on.”<br><br>“Yes, but don't you want to undress me first?”<br><br>“Narcissist.” He refastened his belt and moved towards her. “Well, at least let me take this off so it doesn't poke you in the eye.”<br><br>He tossed his identity card to the ground. His hands slid up the backs of her thighs and cupped her bottom. He tugged on her panties, pushing them down to mid-thigh. Wanting them off, she wriggled and made them fall the rest of the way, then stepped out of them. The muscles in his forearms flexed as he lifted her up by the waist. “The dressing table,” she hissed in his ear. From there she hoped she would be able to see herself in the wardrobe mirror. He sat her down on it, knocking aside pots of cream and tubes of lipstick. Its painted top was cold on her bare behind, making her open her lips in a silent gasp. He kissed her, his furry cheek tickling her small, pointed chin, his tongue brushing her even white teeth.<br><br>He pushed her legs wide. His eyes smouldered at the sight of her blushing labia in the shadow of her rucked up skirt. He stepped between her open knees.<br><br>“Alright. You've shown me. Now I'll show you.”<br><br>She nodded, her heart in her mouth. Ben unzipped his flies and yanked out his cock. It was narrow and lean, its head an angular as a snake's. It pointed straight towards her as though she was the only thing in its world. He touched it to her inner thigh. She gnawed her lip. It was hot, almost scalding against her sensitive skin. He dragged it up one leg, then across her smooth-shaven mound and down the other thigh. Then, snuggling closer still, he let it nose its way up under her skirt until it butted her in the belly button. She arched her back, her bottom wiggling sexily, grinding her flat belly against his erection.<br><br>Craning her head over his shoulder, she glanced into the wardrobe mirror. All she could really see of herself were her knees, either side of Ben's taut, chino-clad bottom. Maybe if she leaned sideways...<br><br>“Where are you going?” Pulling her upright again, Ben hoisted the dress up over her head, exposing her small round breasts and rose-pink nipples to the dappled sunlight breaking in through the tree-shrouded bedroom window. He took half a step back, the head of his penis slithering down and rubbing itself against her clit. It stayed them for a moment, its moist heat causing firework displays behind her eyeballs. Then it dipped, dove inside her, thrust. She heaved a deep breath, her diaphragm tightening with desire, her eyes closing, her bottom lifting clear of the dressing table as she wrapped her arms around Ben's neck, and she forgot about the mirror for the moment.<br><br>Later, she was snoozing happily among the tangled bedsheets, when she was became dimly aware of Ben getting up, shuffling around, zipping up his flies or that bag of his or both. He kissed her lightly on the forehead.<br><br>“Places to go, I'm afraid. But this was lovely.”<br><br>She nodded, too contentedly sleepy to respond. Even if she wanted to move, she couldn't have – her limbs felt like warm butter, half-melted into the mattress. She heard him tiptoeing downstairs, closing the front door gently behind him.<br><br>Eventually, Maisie dragged herself out of bed. She needed a shower. Sauntering back into the bedroom, all cleaned up, she was tempted to climb back under the duvet again, but she decided she ought to read the manuscript. She wasn't exactly a fast reader, and if she was going to get it back to Miss Tweedle any time soon, she'd better make a start. Besides, she was curious – what sort of book had she inspired? Standing there in a towel, yawning, Maisie reached for the pretty antique folder and untied the faded red ribbon. Suddenly she was wide awake, a chill running over her from head to foot.<br><br>The folder was empty.`

                    content: `Maisie stared at the empty folder. Jean-Louis' manuscript! Gone! And only one person who could have taken it – Ben!<br><br>But why?<br><br>He had to be some kind of mad literary memorabilia collector. Or perhaps an unscrupulous dealer, who was prepared to go to any lengths to service his crazed clientele. It seemed absurd, but all the evidence pointed in that direction. Look at the way he had snatched up Jean-Louis' Kleenex! And now he'd used her to scoop up the biggest prize of all!<br><br>For a moment, she felt helpless with horror. She couldn't even imagine what Miss Tweedle would do to her when she found out she'd lost the manuscript. As for the Robbes, it would devastate them. And this would prove once and for all to Aunt Barbara that her niece wasn't fit to run a bookshop. Yes, she'd be chucked out like a set of old encyclopedias.<br><br>No, no, I can't let that happen. I've got to get the manuscript back!<br><br>But how? Call Ben, threaten him, plead with him, tell him she knew what he'd done! Only one problem with that. She'd slept with Ben without even bothering to get his number. Not only am I a rubbish bookseller, she moaned to herself, I'm a total slut too!<br><br>She sat down on the bed, eyes leaking tears, shoulders shaking as she began to snivel. Her bare heel touched something cold. On the floor, between her feet, was Ben's identity card. The thieving bastard must have been so keen to make off with his prize that he'd forgotten to take it with him. She snatched it up and glared at it. There, under his photo, was a contact number for Litstop.<br><br>Hallelujah!<br><br>She keyed the digits into her mobile phone. After a few rings, a bored-sounded man with a Northern accent picked up. When she asked for Ben, he mumbled something about him being out on assignment.<br><br>“Where?”<br><br>“Um, can I ask what this is regarding?”<br><br>“I want to punch him in the face.”<br><br>It probably wasn't the best thing to say, but her show of exasperation worked, because the terrified man blurted, “The Reading on the River event. Down at the Riverbank Leisure Centre.”<br><br>Maisie hung up. The Riverbank Leisure Centre! If she took the cycle path she could get there in five minutes. She threw on the first item of clothing that came to hand, which happened to be last night's dress. Then she slipped on a pair of red Converse trainers, seized her tote bag, grabbed her auntie's bike and headed out. As she climbed onto the saddle, she realized she'd forgotten her underwear. Oh well – no time to worry about a little thing like that when Jean-Louis' manuscript was at stake.<br><br>Dumping her bag in the bicycle basket, she pedalled to the end of the street and turned off onto the cycle path. Lined with trees that striped it with deep shade, it ran in a bee-line down to the river, through a leafy park and past the High School playing fields. With the cathedral spire and the university buildings beyond, the vista never failed to impress Maisie – usually. Not today. She pumped her knees furiously, one hand on the handlebars, the other hovering over her skirt, which began to flutter dangerously as she picked up speed, earning her some curious glances from the joggers and dog walkers who were sharing the path with her.<br><br>Her phone rang. Praying it was Ben, she fished it out of her bag as she careered along.<br><br>“Well? What's the verdict?”<br><br>Maisie tried not to groan as she recognized Miss Tweedle's voice.<br><br>“I'm guessing you've steamed through Jean-Louis' manuscript by now. So – are we looking at a best seller?”<br><br>If I can lay my hands on it, Maisie thought unhappily.<br><br>“Give us a hint, then. What's it about?”<br><br>Maisie just about had the presence of mind to stammer, “Wouldn't you rather wait? I'd hate to spoil it for you!”<br><br>“Fair point. So can you pop it back some time later today? I know Jean-Louis' eager to hear what you think too!”<br><br>Brilliant, no pressure then. Maisie couldn't help heaving a sigh. Then she let out a shriek.<br><br>A freak gust of wind appeared out of nowhere, making her skirt balloon up to her armpits. The left hand, the one that was supposed to be protecting her modesty, was currently clutching her mobile phone to her ear, leaving her no choice but to wrestle the flimsy garment back down between her knees with her right. That meant she was now cycling along with no hands on the handlebars. And as her shopper swerved and teetered, another bike suddenly shot out of the patch of deep shade right in front of her.<br><br>It was touch and go for a moment, but Maisie finally managed to stop without doing herself or anyone else an injury. The other cyclist – a pretty teenage blonde in purple bib shorts – stopped too. She swivelled in her saddle to throw Maisie a nasty look, which turned into a sneer of amusement.<br><br>In her efforts to regain control of the bike, Maise had lost her seating and almost toppled over the handlebars, but the back of her skirt was still draped over the saddle, with the result that at least one of her blushing pink bum cheeks was clearly visible to the other girl. Before Maisie could yank the dress free, the blonde snapped a picture of the wardrobe malfunction with her smartphone.<br><br>“What was that?” Miss Tweedle was still on the line. “Did you have an accident? Has something happened to Jean-Louis' manuscript?”<br><br>“It's nothing,” Maisie sing-songed into her phone. “Sorry. Gotta go.”<br><br>With the girl still clicking away, Maisie cycled on at top speed. Another few minutes, and she emerged next to the Riverbank Leisure Centre, an award-winning piece of architecture that looked like a giant blue and white soap dish. She hopped off her bike. By the looks of it, the Reading on the River was already under way. A group of punts laden with tourists, literary themed picnic hampers and presumably one or two authors had just pushed off from shore and was making its way awkwardly upstream, towards the green lawns of Bishop's Mead. Shading her eyes, Maisie scanned the punts, but Ben didn't seem to be anywhere among them. Maybe he had been and gone? Or maybe he was somewhere nearby, writing up what he had seen?<br><br>Hoping and praying that was the case, she pushed the shopper a little way further along the pathway. And that was when she spotted him, sitting on a bench beside the riverbank.<br><br>The manuscript was on his knee. He was reading the pages one by one and tossing them into the river, where they undulated gently on its glassy surface.<br><br>“Oh my God!”<br><br>Maisie dropped her bike, ran forward and jumped in to rescue them, gasping as the icy-cold water shot up under her dress. Tossed about by the ripples that spread out from the point of impact, the pages began to sink. She snatched at them wildly.<br><br>“Maisie, what the fuck?” Shoving the rest of the manuscript in his bag, Ben leapt to his feet and approached the edge of the water. “Have you gone mental? Get on out of there!”<br><br>He offered his hand. She ignored him, grabbing at the soggy pages and clutching them to her chest. Only when she had every last one did she grudgingly let herself be hauled out onto the bank.<br><br>“Christ, you could have done yourself an injury. What were you thinking?” Ben was staring at her, as were one or two passers-by who had stopped to see what was going on.<br><br>She was certainly a sight. She glared back at him, oozing water from every pore, her hair and trainers a squelchy mess. Fuming, she covered a boob that had popped out, tugged her skirt down over her shiny-wet rump. Not that it helped much – because of the way her thin frock stuck to her body, an opaque film that hid nothing, she still looked almost naked. On top of that, she was freezing cold standing there in the shade; it was only anger that stopped her teeth from chattering.<br><br>“What was I thinking? What were you thinking, you pillock? You've no idea what we went through to get this bloody book written, and you go and toss it in the river? Jean-Louis is going to hate me, Miss Tweedle is going to kill me. Oh fuck, oh fuck.”<br><br>She tried to straighten out the pages with her wet hands. Only then did an uncomfortable thought strike her. Jean-Louis' new book had been handwritten. These pages were word processed and had come off an inkjet printer.<br><br>What was going on?<br><br>This wasn't Jean-Louis' manuscript...<br><br>“Don't worry,” said Ben, “your manuscript's fine, bone dry the last time I checked.”<br><br>“Then what...?”<br><br>She blinked at him, completely nonplussed. He took advantage of her state of surprise to steer her out of the shade towards the sunny bench, where she sat down numbly.<br><br>“What you saw was this.” He pulled another bundle of papers, rather thicker than Jean-Louis' manuscript, out of his bag and showed it to her.<br><br>Squinting through watery eyes, she peered at the topmost page. A letter of some sort. Long, rambling, typed on a word processor. Then she jumped as she saw to whom it was addressed.<br><br>“This a letter to Jean-Louis!”<br><br>“Well spotted. To be exact, it's my letter to Jean-Louis.”<br><br>“Your letter? What were you writing to Jean-Louis for?”<br><br>“Because I had a lot to say to him, or thought I did. I wrote a whole bunch of versions, pages and pages. That's what I was destroying when you arrived on the scene in your inimitable fashion.”<br><br>She was still completely lost. Noting how thick the bundle of papers was, she remarked, “That can't all be one letter. What's the rest?”<br><br>“This little lot? These are letters written by Jean-Louis to my mother. Or scans of them, at any rate. The originals are –“<br><br>“Whoa!” she cut him off with a wave of her still-soggy hand. “Backtrack. Jean-Louis knew your mother?”<br><br>Now she was totally confused. Forgetting for a moment that she was a wet girl in a see-through dress in a public place, she stared at him all agog.<br><br>“Freaky, right?” said Ben, sitting down next to her. “I only found out after she died.”<br><br>His mother knew Jean-Louis and she was dead? Maisie couldn't keep up. By the time it occurred to offer her condolences, Ben was already speaking again, with a wistful smile:<br><br>“She was a free spirit, my mum. Kind of embarrassing, actually. She was into all kinds of mad stuff – healing crystals and ley lines and UFOs. Even the way she died – in a road accident on her way to Stonehenge with a bunch of her hippy-dippy mates for the winter solstice. Apparently they were all baked out of their skulls. Still, she lived her life the way she wanted to, fearlessly, that's the main thing.”<br><br>Taken at face value, this wasn't the most fulsome of eulogies perhaps, but she sensed the warmth and love behind his words. He quickly came to the point. “Anyway, afterwards, when I was going through her belongings, I found this cache of letters, and you won't believe what they prove.”<br><br>“The two of them had an affair!” Then, digesting the full implications of this, “Your mum was the original naked English girl?”<br><br>“It was just like it was in the book. Girl escapes her stifling suburban family and dull fiancé and goes on her hols to the south of France, where she meets a sophisticated older dude and has a wildly passionate affair. The dude, of course, was our Monsieur Robbe. He and Lise were on a break at the time. These,” Ben explained, patting the stack of papers, “were the letters that Jean-Louis wrote to her after she got back. They recreate the affair in loving detail, reliving the whole thing on the page. He stopped writing them when she got married, by which time she was already extremely pregnant. With me.”<br><br>“Wait a minute... You mean you're... that's to say, Jean-Louis is...”<br><br>She gaped at him.<br><br>Tall, handsome, literary-minded.<br><br>It made sense.<br><br>Ben lowered his eyes, keeping whatever emotions were churning inside him to himself. “I always knew Denis – that was my mum's first husband – wasn't my real dad. I think he knew it too. The guy's ginger with freckles for Pete's sake, whereas I'm kind of dark and Mediterranean. As soon as DNA testing became widely available, I checked and sure enough... So you see, on one level, these letters only confirmed something I'd always known. Anyway, after I found them, I researched Jean-Louis, bought his books second hand and kept my eyes peeled for any news of him online. There wasn't much, which was frustrating. Then I read about the book launch, and its tie-in with the Dalchester literary festival. I wangled an internship on Litstop and I've been sleeping on a friend of a friend's couch, all just so I can be in the same town as him.”<br><br>“But why didn't you say anything? To Jean-Louis? Or to me?”<br><br>“Well, when I saw how elderly he was... I thought the best thing was to grab something of his and do a quick DNA test, just to be absolutely certain.”<br><br>The Kleenex! That's why he snagged the used Kleenex! He wasn't a mad memorabilia collector after all. And oh Jesus – the coatstand man! The shadowy figure lurking in Miss Tweedle's office at Jean-Louis' talk, who saw Maisie pleasuring herself in a moment of complete abandon... That was Ben!<br><br>Suddenly feeling very cross and embarrassed, she snapped, “But that still doesn't explain why you stole Jean-Louis's manuscript. You weren't going to test that for DNA, were you?”<br><br>He grimaced. “Sorry about that. I just couldn't help myself, I was overcome by curiosity. I thought I had a right to be the first to read it. In my defence, I was going to return it to you right away. I would never have destroyed it. I'd have given it back to you already, if you weren't still a bit moist about the edges.”<br><br>“It's not funny,” she scowled, not at all appreciating the way the corners of his lips were twitching with amusement.<br><br>“It is kind of,” he said. “I haven't told you the best part yet. The reason why I was throwing my letter in the river when you found me.”<br><br>Maisie turned from him with a shrug, feigning indifference. Ignoring her play-acting, he continued. “I sent Jean-Louis' snotty Kleenex off to an express testing lab, and I just got back an email about twenty minutes ago.”<br><br>“And?” She gave up pretending she wasn't listening.<br><br>“Turns out he's not my father after all. ”<br><br>She squeaked like he'd just poked her with a sharp stick. “He's not? How's that possible?”<br><br>Ben rubbed his stubbly chin. “Well, now I come to think of it, in the book my mum's character does sleep with a couple of other guys as well, so maybe it was one of them.”<br><br>Maisie swallowed a sudden fit of giggles. Poor Ben. His mother sounded like a right goer...<br><br>Ben bent his features into an expression of mock outrage. “You do realize this is emotional dynamite for me? Could you try not to laugh in my face?”<br><br>“Sorry. What are you going to do now?”<br><br>He shrugged. “Don't know. One thing's for sure, I can't spend my whole life chasing after random Frenchman.”<br><br>Maisie shifted her soggy bottom on the bench. Now that Ben's story was over, she was conscious of the spectacle she was making of herself in her soaking wet frock.<br><br>“Ugh! That's it, I'm off home for a hot shower and a change of clothes. Come on.”<br><br>“I can walk with you?”<br><br>“I need you to carry the manuscript. Oh, and I'm borrowing your T-shirt.”<br><br>He pulled it off and tossed it to her. She wriggled into it gratefully. Within moments it was almost as damp as her dress, but at least now she had the benefit of layers. Leaving a trail of wet footprints behind her, she picked up her auntie's shopper and began pushing it back along the cycle path.<br><br>“I'm dead sorry about everything.”<br><br>She half-smiled. She had already more or less decided to let him off, what with his impressive tale of woe and the fact that he looked so lithe and limber with his shirt off, but it was nice to have a formal apology.<br><br>“So what's it like?” she asked. “I'm assuming you've read it?”<br><br>“Jean-Louis' manuscript? I had a look at it, yeah.”<br><br>“And?”<br><br>“Don't you want to wait and see for yourself?”<br><br>“Well, obviously I'll form my own opinion. But I'm curious to know what you think.”<br><br>Actually, it had crossed her mind that, with Miss Tweedle pressing for the manuscript's return, she could just get the low-down from Ben and save herself the bother of deciphering the great author's handwriting.<br><br>She quirked an eyebrow, inviting an answer. Ben looked uncomfortable. “To be honest, I wasn't exactly blown away. I know you were his muse and everything, but –“<br><br>“Go on.”<br><br>“Well, if you must know, it just seemed like a rather tired rehash of The Naked English Girl. Of course, it's hard to tell from a rough copy, but I don't think this is going to be the triumphant return to form you were all hoping for. Sorry.”<br><br>“Thanks for your candour.” She walked on, wheeling her bike.<br><br>“You don't seem too disappointed.”<br><br>Maisie treated him to a sly smile. “That's because I've got a plan.”`

                    content: `Maisie caught up with Miss Tweedle at Heart's Desire at closing time and returned Jean-Louis' manuscript.<br><br>“You made photocopies?” said Miss Tweedle, opening the folder and seeing clean white extra pages along with the handwritten ones.<br><br>“Well, you know. Can't be too careful.”<br><br>“How thoughtful of you. I'll hold onto these for safekeeping and we can give the original back to Jean-Louis. So – what did you think of it?”<br><br>This was the moment Maisie had been dreading. After treating herself to a nice long shower, Maisie had dipped into the manuscript, only to find herself agreeing with Ben: Jean-Louis did appear to have written the same book all over again. Of course, Ben had the advantage of her in that he had actually read The Naked English Girl, but Maisie felt as if she had come to know it pretty well over the past days. And if the broad similarities were apparent even to her, they would presumably be glaring to any Jean-Louis Robbe aficionados out there.<br><br>Miss Tweedle was still awaiting her verdict. Maisie flapped her hands excitedly.<br><br>“Loved it. Couldn't put it down. There's just one thing...”<br><br>“Yes?”<br><br>“Some people might think – just here or there – that it's a little bit like The Naked English Girl –“<br><br>“Oh, don't worry about that,” Miss Tweedle shrugged, locking the photocopies away in a filing cabinet and retying the folder. “Authors rewrite the same book all the time. It's a brand new novel by Jean-Louis Robbe, that's the important thing. We've accomplished something that no one else has managed to do. Who cares if it's a little samey? Just tell Jean-Louis that you liked it.”<br><br>Maisie nodded obediently. “Are we still meeting them at that wine bar like you texted earlier?”<br><br>“They should be there by now. Did I tell you I got them a radio interview?”<br><br>“You did. Congrats. Sounds like interest is really picking up.”<br><br>“Shame they're going home tomorrow, but Lise is anxious to get back to her cats, and you know Jean-Louis, no way he'll stay without her...”<br><br>Miss Tweedle chattered on as she locked up the shop and they walked the short distance to the wine bar. Although her face wore a truculent expression out of habit, she was almost bubbly, her financial anxieties alleviated for the time being. Maisie couldn't help being a little shocked at her cynical attitude to Jean-Louis's new book, though. She was worried about Jean-Louis – what would he think? It was unsurprising that, last night, in all the excitement, the fact that his new book bore a strong resemblance to The Naked English Girl had escaped him, but he was sure to spot it eventually, and wouldn't that be a wee bit depressing? And even if he failed to notice, the reading public surely wouldn't. As Ben had pointed out, it was hardly the triumphant comeback everyone had been hoping for.<br><br>Then again, what do I know? Maisie reflected. I'm not even a proper bookseller, not officially.<br><br>They found the Robbes ensconced at a corner table. The interview had gone well and Jean-Louis was positively purring with pleasure. Kisses on the cheek and small talk were exchanged, drinks ordered, then they looked at Maisie expectantly.<br><br>“We're anxious to know, how did you enjoy the book? Be gentle and remember that it was only a rough draft.”<br><br>Maisie felt her mouth going dry. This was her cue to glance across to the bar and give a small nod.<br><br>“Oh, it was awesome. Really, I don't know where to begin. But actually, I've got a surprise for you.” She gestured nervously towards the tall, slender figure who had approached at her signal and was now hovering over them. “You remember Ben?”<br><br>“My friend the almost writer,” said Jean-Louis.<br><br>“Ben's got something to tell you.”<br><br>Ben swallowed. He hadn't wanted to do this at first, but she'd talked him into it. She was convinced it would be cathartic for him. Plus he owed her big time.<br><br>“May I sit?” he asked.<br><br>Jean-Louis and Lise wore expressions of polite confusion, Miss Tweedle a not-so-polite expression of annoyance. Maisie was grateful for Ben's charm, which carried him smoothly through the next few moments as he pulled up a chair and flashed a touchingly awkward smile around the table.<br><br>“It's kind of personal actually,” he said to Jean-Louis. “Look, I'll just blurt it out. You knew my mother a long time ago.”<br><br>“I did?” Jean-Louis waited for Ben for explain, but the young man simply gazed across the table at him with mild brown eyes.<br><br>Then the penny dropped. Jean-Louis looked at Ben more closely. There was a new tone in his voice – something calm and grave – as he asked, “Who exactly are you, young man?”<br><br>“I'm Caroline's son. You remember Caroline?”<br><br>If this was a shock to the old man, he didn't show it. He simply nodded, a tremendous stillness seeming to fall upon him.<br><br>Ben lowered his eyes. “Sorry I didn't tell you who I was earlier.<br><br>“These things are never easy,” the writer murmured softly, almost to himself.<br><br>Faced with this blast from the past, Maisie reckoned that nine people out of ten would have bolted for the door. Jean-Louis did get up, but only to sidle around the table and throw his arms around Ben in a hug that was solid and deliberate. It confirmed her impression that, whatever his failings as a writer, he was at heart a decent sort of bloke.<br><br>“But how is Caroline?” he wanted to know.<br><br>The elderly writer's face fell when Ben told him that she had passed away. Was that a moment of unsteadiness as he sat back in his chair? The next moment he was his full, ultra-civilised self again. Lise, ever loyal, squeezed his arm. She smiled bravely. “This certainly is a wonderful surprise. You'll have to forgive us, we're not used to such excitement.”<br><br>“The thing is, Mr Robbe, I have something for you.”<br><br>All eyes were on Ben as he reached into his shoulder bag. What was he going to pull out? A gun? An old souvenir? Maisie felt a swell of excitement at being the only one to know what was going to happen next.<br><br>“These are the letters you wrote Caroline all those years ago.”<br><br>Maisie's heart thudded as Ben passed the scans over the table. The author's long brown hands trembled slightly as they accepted the weighty bundle.<br><br>“I had forgotten,” Jean-Louis murmured. “I thought they were lost.”<br><br>“It's all there,” said Maisie, “reminiscences about the time you spent together, erotic fantasises. Anyway, we were thinking that they would make an amazing book. The Real Naked English Girl... like the sound of that, Miss Tweedle? You know how people love true-life stories, and there are lots of photos as well – Ben added some at the back there.”<br><br>That was all Miss Tweedle needed to hear to take command of the pile of papers and start flicking through them.<br><br>“I can't believe Caroline is gone,” said Jean-Louis sadly.<br><br>“Don't worry,” said Ben. “It's all good. She led a full life, from the moment she met you.”<br><br>They began to reminiscence. Maisie glanced across at Lise, but she seemed happy, relaxed about past affairs and glad for her husband to be reminded of such precious memories. As for Miss Tweedle, she was looking through the letters with an expression of rapture, because this bundle surely had the making of a bestseller.<br><br>Pleased with her work, Maisie decided to excuse herself after she'd finished her drink, and leave them to iron out the details and get to know each other better. Her job here was done, and she suddenly felt eager to see her aunt.`

                    content: `Aunt Barbara's bookshop was still open, although the lights were dimmed, a sign she was about to close up. She was inside, taking advantage of the early evening quiet to put some new stock on the shelves.<br><br>“Hello, stranger. Gosh, I've hardly seen you this last week.”<br><br>Was that her aunt's way of hinting that some people had seen far too much of her? Or was Maisie being paranoid? “Well, the Robbes are leaving tomorrow, so Miss Tweedle won't need me any more … So I'm all yours again,” Maisie added hopefully, nervously picking up the nearest book to hand, an illustrated guide to meerschaum pipes.<br><br>“Oh, I see.” Aunt Barbara tucked a bulky techno-thriller into place.<br><br>What now? Am I staying or am I going? The need to have this question resolved was now almost painfully urgent. Maisie stared at her aunt's shoulders and the back of her head, interrogating them for hints as to her state of mind. Finally, feeling as though she was going to burst, she blurted out:<br><br>“I do love working here, Auntie Barbara.”<br><br>“Oh, good.”<br><br>“I was, er....”<br><br>“Hmm?”<br><br>The willowy redhead steeled her nerve. “I was wondering... hoping... maybe I could stay on permanently?”<br><br>Her aunt faced around again, slowly. Don't show any weakness. That's what people said about lions and tigers. Maisie was pretty sure it applied to aunts as well.<br><br>Aunt Barbara smiled. “The truth is, Maisie, you've made such an impression on my customers, I wouldn't dare get rid of you, even if I wanted to. Of course you can stay on. I'm sure you'll more than earn your keep.”<br><br>“Oh, Auntie, thank you! Thank you!” Tripping forward, Maisie wrapped her slender arms around her aunt's capacious midriff and snuggled her face affectionately against her greying hair. “Auntie, I love you so much!”<br><br>“Yes, yes, I know you do. But would you feel that way if I didn't have all this?”<br><br>“Auntie!” Maisie's eyes brimmed with shock and hurt. Not because it wasn't true, but because her aunt had been mean enough to mention it. It wasn't her fault she was shallow.<br><br>“Never mind. I wouldn't want you any other way.” Aunt Barbara's bosom heaved in a silent chuckle. “Oh, and about all that going up the stepladder.”<br><br>“Never again,” Maisie vowed solemnly.<br><br>“Well, that would be a pity. I'd hoped I could count on you to keep the top shelf fully stocked at least a couple of times a day. I wasn't above spending a fair amount of time up the stepladder myself in my younger days, you know.”<br><br>Maisie's eyes widened a little. These days her aunt looked like a tea cosy, so it took her a moment to get her head around this disclosure and the mental pictures it conjured up. But she nodded eagerly. “Anything you say, Auntie! Whatever it takes to be a totally kickass bookseller!”<br><br>They were grinning at each other, when there was a sharp rap on the window.<br><br>A female face, surmounted by a policewoman's chequered bowler hat, was scowling in at them over the displays of leather-bound books.<br><br>Oh god! The butch WPC! The one Maisie was supposed to be hooking up with! The one whose phone calls she'd been ducking!<br><br>“That constable seems very irked about something.”<br><br>“Does she?” said Maisie, who was doing her best to hide behind her aunt.<br><br>“See the way she's crooking her finger at you? You'd better go and see what she wants.”<br><br>“Er – do you I have to?”<br><br>“Whatever it takes, Maisie.”<br><br>Maisie sighed and went.`
