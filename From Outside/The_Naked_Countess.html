      { title: "Prologue", summary: "A tale about a woman from a CMNF world.", content: "The concept of alternate realities has populated fiction for many decades, sometimes to the detriment of actual physicists who had their works misconstrued by the general public. But how can you blame the people eager to think that the sci-fi multiverse idea can be real? After all, it was interesting for many to imagine that our universe was a part of a bigger whole and that other versions of them lived somewhere in the endless cosmos. Of course, most knew that while the existence of alternate realities could not be disproven, it also couldn't be proven due to humanity's lack of knowledge, so these ideas remained in the realm of fiction. At least up until the year 2000, when a group of scientists working on a secret project in Nevada discovered an actual alternate reality.<br><br>Their experiment was originally meant to discover means of teleportation by severing the inherent connection between space and time. While the research team didn't reach their goals, they got even more than they'd bargained for, and their experimental portal became the most notable scientific advancement of the century. However, nobody was willing to use the invention at first. Not even the best scientists could predict what they would see on the other side. There could've been deadly viruses, horrific monsters, or just a landscape so alien it would scare them for life. However, the first thing the research team saw was none of that. It was a fit, attractive woman, which could've easily been mistaken for the resident of their own world. Of course, outside of the fact that she was completely naked and didn't seem to have any modesty whatsoever.<br><br>Shortly after the first contact, the newly discovered civilization became the talk of the entire world. Linguists, sociologists, biologists, chemists, and physicists from around the globe competed for a chance to participate in the exploration while the media reported every new finding. After a year of hard work, humanity learned enough to establish diplomatic connections with the locals. Both sides were humans, a commonality used by their leaders to bridge the initial gap. The other earth was labeled Sanflaria, after the giant transcontinental empire that was the only state in that world. Sanflarians weren't hostile but maintained an entirely different society, which seemed advanced to some and barbaric to others. They only used solar energies, lived in tight-knit communities, and had a complex social hierarchy that was hard to grasp for an outsider.<br><br>But the main difference was the fact that all Sanflarian females were obligated to remain naked at all times, regardless of circumstances. While this fact surprised many, it turned out to be for their own safety: the researchers established that the local sun's rays caused an odd reaction that was completely different for the owners of XX and XY chromosomes. Men were mostly fine, although prolonged direct exposure to the rays could cause sunburns, heatstroke, and even vomiting, like from minor radiation poisoning. Women, on the other hand, were completely immune to their star's light as long as they didn't wear clothes. Putting something on caused rashes, fever, and sometimes could even lead to death. This seemed to have been caused by a genetic mutation that all Sanflarian females had contracted through exposure to their sun's light.<br><br>As expected, this division was a cornerstone of Sanflarian culture, being an important part of the locals' social, religious, and professional lives. It also created tensions between the two worlds: many earth residents thought that Sanflaria was rooted in sexism and discrimination, while Sanflarians considered the sight of a clothed woman offensive and immoral. However, Sanflaria's advanced science and solar-based technologies forced the earth governments to continue pursuing an alliance, even if it meant making concessions along the way. This led to the historical Interworld Cooperation Pact finally being signed in 2025, which opened many doors for both civilizations<br><br>Aside from that, the newly formed ties between the worlds also meant that the earth's male population will see a lot more nude girls in their lives... While some parts of the female one will find themselves in positions where they'll have to get naked themselves." },
      { title: "Chapter 1", summary: "Clerk with a Dream", content: "Arnold never had luck with women. He didn't try it much either: the twenty-year-old's shyness and meek demeanor made talking with any girl a challenge, and it only got harder with each rejection he received. At some point, it didn't seem like it was worth trying. After all, even if Arnold got a girl to go on a date, he simply didn't offer enough to keep her interested. Nobody wanted to hit on an office clerk with no higher education who was skin and bones and whose height was average at best. He was kinda cute with his nice-looking face and black hair, but less like a boyfriend and more like a little brother, leaving him with no hope whatsoever. At least before he met Eleonora, a girl literally out of this world.<br><br>His fascination with Sanflaria started more than a year ago, ever since he got his job. Working at the Interworld Communication Agency, or ICA for short, Arnold had plenty of opportunities to observe the otherworldly civilization. Especially its female part, which often fueled his fantasies and desires. The clerk enjoyed seeing naked girls, even more than most males did. No girl ever stripped for him, but many photos and videos of them doing it online were enough to stir his interest. Especially when they did it in public. Arnold couldn't help but admire them for their courage and generocity. That's why even a mere sight of a confident, nude female filled him with a peculiar mixture of happiness and anxiety.<br><br>Naturally, when Arnold learned about the entire civilization where women walked around naked all the time, he fell in love with it. The clerk imagined Sanflarian girls as soft and understanding, eager to give up their modesty for their men. While his female coworkers scoffed at the Sanflarian gals, calling them shameless or â€¶poor things forced to live in patriarchy,â€¶ Arnold approved of their lifestyle and dreamed of meeting one of them himself. Like it often happens, fate gifted him this chance when he least expected it.<br><br>â€¶Hey u there?â€¶ A message appeared on Arnold's phone as he was slaving at his computer, â€¶remember, it's gotta be today!â€¶<br><br>Arnold's hand trembled a little when he picked up the device. The contact's name was simply â€¶Travel Buddyâ€¶, an alias the man gave to the clerk himself.<br><br>â€¶I will come. No worries,â€¶ the clerk texted back and looked over his shoulders just in case.<br><br>â€¶Cool! Get to the hill by 6 PM and don't forget the codes. I'm sure she'll like you.â€¶<br><br>The last phrase caused goosebumps with an odd mixture of pleasure and anxiety. Even though Arnold has been working for ICA for more than a year, that'll be the first time he'll meet a Sanflarian girl in person. And not just some regular girl, but Eleonora, a young countess of one of the Empire's largest provinces. The clerk's â€¶travel buddyâ€¶ sent him her picture too, and she was a knockout. A tall, beautiful woman with an hourglass figure that flawlessly combined athleticism from long training and feminine curves gifted to her by mother nature.<br><br>Arnold spent more than an hour looking at that photo back then, as it was a sight to behold: from the girl's large, round breasts contrasting with her flat belly to her long legs and taut backside, her proportions seemed perfect, as if she were not a mere human but a statue of a goddess created by a renowned sculptor. Her face was no worse than her body, with elegant features and a bold gaze in her sapphire eyes. The cherry on top was the girl's hair, a long blonde mane freely falling on the countess' shoulders behind her back.<br><br>Arnold's gaze slowly traveled across Eleonora's voluptuous form, finally landing on her pussy, tight and completely shaven, which was customary among the Sanflarian females. Thoughts rushed through the clerk's head when he imagined himself near that knockout, not even sure how he'd cope with his emotions. He didn't reach an answer, as a female voice interrupted him.<br><br>â€¶Arnold, are you going to do your job today?â€¶<br><br>He turned around and saw Debrah, a local administrator, and his higher-up. The Eleonora's picture was a stark contrast to this overweight, middle-aged woman in an old sweater.<br><br>â€¶Re-check the emails sent by the transportation department. We need to make sure everything works as intended... And stop being gross,â€¶ Debrah scoffed as she saw the busty blonde on his phone screen.<br><br>â€¶Um, but I need to learn Sanflarian features to know whom we're working with. It's part of our job, r-right?â€¶ The clerk made a meek attempt to defend himself.<br><br>â€¶Sure. Just don't forget to look at her face at least once,â€¶ the administrator said with skepticism and went away, leaving Arnold alone with his embarrassment and an endless stream of workmail.<br><br>The last few days were stressful here at ICA, even for the office plankton. Recently, the Sanflarian government sent one of their noblemen to negotiate terms of an upcoming construction project, something about a new portal to increase the flow of goods. Considering how hard it was to make reclusive Sanflarians sign any kind of deal, the local government made it their primary goal to ensure that everything goes smoothly.<br><br>â€¶That noble will probably haggle the portal's price, like they always do,â€¶ one of Arnold's employees named Derek said in a tired tone.<br><br>â€¶Too bad they didn't send a woman. She'd convince the heads to build it for free in no time!â€¶ Arnold jested, to which several of his female coworkers rolled their eyes.<br><br>The clerk awkwardly giggled and went back to his computer. There were several hours of work waiting for him today, so he tried his best to concentrate. It wasn't easy since the job was boring even on normal days, much more so when his mind was occupied by a hot, otherworldly blonde. Once in a while, Arnold's attention strayed from the emails and focused on the database containing many articles about Sanflarian culture.<br><br>He thought about what he could ask Eleonora about her homeland, how he could show his approval of her lifestyle, and which topics he should discuss. It was hard to decide since even ICA employees could only see glimpses of Sanflaria due to its inhabitants' secluded culture. But even those bits of information made many want more, especially the photos!<br><br>Arnold opened a text about Sanflarian education. It showed an image of five freshmen girls walking on the pavement outside of a large university building. They were smiling, talking to one another, and showing off their record books, as if unaware that all of them were naked except for bows in their hair. Each of them was thin and athletic, a result of sports being common and often mandatory for Sanflarian females.<br><br>The second article was about agriculture, showing a vast field and a maroon sunset in the distance. Two curvy, shapely women were standing near a machine resembling a harvester, wearing nothing but sandals. Their bodies were covered in sweat and lumps of dirt. Little scratches were also visible here and there, due to the lack of protection. And yet, the women were smiling, clearly proud of their work.<br><br>Another report was about one of the Sanflarian cities and had a large photo above its header. It was a crowded street with futuristic, smooth-edged buildings surrounded by solar panels and greenery filling the background. Of course, the first thing that Arnold noticed were the people: clothed males and naked females of different ages and body types. The latter often had tattoos, jewelry, colorful make-up, or other accessories that could help them stand out from the naked crowd. Women, Arnold thought with a smirk.<br><br>â€¶Did you check the seventh form yet?â€¶ Arnold's colleague Adam asked again.<br><br>The clerk quickly closed his tabs, even though his apathetic coworker didn't even seem to notice them.<br><br>â€¶N-not yet, I'll get to it asap!â€¶<br><br>â€¶You better.â€¶<br><br>Indeed, Arnold thought it was better to just finish this ordeal and focus on his upcoming date later.<br><br>The hours passed in nervous anticipation. Debrah tried making the clerk work overtime again, probably still jealous about Eleonora's naked form attracting him more than her abysmal sweater, but Arnold found the right moment and snuck home while she had a coffee. Knowing the administrator that coffee will probably turn into a full pastry dinner, so she won't even know the clerk was gone for some time. He stopped in the restroom to make sure he looked fine, then got on the bus and prepared for his long ride. His â€¶travel buddyâ€¶ must've already been waiting.<br><br>Anxious thoughts flooded the clerk's brain as he looked at the town soaked in the orange rays. He became doubtful whether he should've trusted this man he barely knew. They met online in a group dedicated to appreciating the Sanflarian girls' naked lifestyle. This guy went by the name â€¶Sungoodsâ€¶ and posted many pictures there, claiming that he made them himself and the girls willingly posed for his camera. Once he even posted himself standing in-between two beautiful, shameless brunettes, but his face was blurred so nobody could truly tell. This man never told Arnold what he did for a living, but the clerk figured he was some sort of smuggler, having both money and connections to avoid being caught.<br><br>The two weren't that interested in each other until they talked one evening, and Arnold shared his dream about finding love with a Sanflarian gal. It soon turned out that he was in luck: the smuggler was planning to help one of them get into our world, and he needed somebody from ICA to assist him. This wasn't anything bad, too. That gorgeous blonde Eleonora said she needed this to find her cousin, who apparently came to Earth sometime earlier and got into trouble. The girl's parents disallowed her from going, so she decided to take on this naked quest on her own, eager to aid her family.<br><br>Arnold was in awe when he first heard about this. He imagined this soft, cute girl who neverless was ready to face dangers and difficulties simply to help one of her own. The clerk dreamed about her stepping from a portal with a smile and them waving to each other awkwardly before going on their adventure, during which they'll fall in love and live happily ever after. Of course, there was no concrete proof that the smuggler wasn't lying to steal Arnold's ICA documents, but the clerk chose to believe him, as he was really convincing.<br><br>â€¶How is she doing?â€¶ The clerk texted, getting bored on the bus.<br><br>â€¶Id say quite well,â€¶ his partner in literal crime replied and and sent him a screenshot of the blondie's message.<br><br>Arnold smiled while reading the text. It simply said: I'm coming, all of you be ready! <3 <3 <3<br><br>The bus arrived at a desolate stop at the edge of the town. Only desert and the dark evening sky awaited beyond it. At least that's what most civilians would think. To the contrary, the clerk knew that behind the hills there was a fenced house. It looked like a shack from the outside, but on the inside, it was much bigger, leading into an underground ICA facility. The government planned to use this hidden portal to transport objects and materials they didn't want the general public to see. Then the heads cut the project since apparently finding more effective ways for their legal contraband. Of course, anything more specific than that explanation was above the clerks' clearance.<br><br>But neither Arnold nor his buddy care much about the politics. They were interested in a portal, which apparently was still functional if one knew the codes. The same codes Arnold illegally copied yesterday, risking the loss of job at best, but most likely jailtime. The clerk would never believe he could do it, but each time he began shivering and wanted to turn back, he imagined Eleonora somewhere in her world, all cute and naked, and this drove him forward. Testosterone truly was one hell of a drug.<br><br>The facility was usually guarded, but due to the nobleman's arrival, the staff was needed elsewhere, and the old abandoned facility was left alone like a relic of a bygone era. When the clerk walked up to the gate, he heard a gun click behind his back. Like any responsible adult, Arnold fell on his knees with his hands behind his head and begged the guards not to kill him. Two voices, male and female, giggled at his pleas, then one of them spoke:<br><br>â€¶No worries, man. It's us, your travel buddies. We've mistaken you for a guard ourselves.â€¶<br><br>Arnold got up and let out a nervous laugh, cleaning his pants from the sand. Then, a disturbing thought came to his mind:<br><br>â€¶And what you'd do if I were a guard? Why did you bring guns anyway?â€¶<br><br>His companions were both armed with six shooters and clad in dark clothing; even their faces were hidden behind masks. The man who introduced himself as Sungoods also wore a stetson, like he mistook their scheme for a western.<br><br>â€¶Don't know about you, but we feel safer like this when in the desert at night,â€¶ the woman said jokingly.<br><br>â€¶Alright, let's not waste any time. Our friend's waiting for us,â€¶ Sungoods said and nodded at Arnold to open the gate.<br><br>The clerk was already feeling that this was more of a command than a request. Maybe trusting a random stranger on social media wasn't his best decision after all. Still, he was willing to endure this discomfort for Eleonora. Ella, as he now called her in his mind with hopes of soon using this name in reality. So Arnold complied and opened the gates, then used his ICA keycard to unlock the door and led his companions into a gray, imposing corridor beneath the surface.<br><br>In several minutes, they reached a large room filled with computers and control panels. In its center was a machine resembling a doorway made of metal and covered in wires. This sight would be exciting for many civilians since the majority only ever saw such portals on photos. However, all three interlopers were familiar with the technology, so they didn't waste time and began the operation. Arnold carefully stepped through the danger tape covering the main panel and activated it with his code. The portal began buzzing, slowly activating.<br><br>â€¶Alright,â€¶ Sungoods hid his gun, then pointed at his female companion, â€¶now you strip naked.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sure, I... What?!â€¶ The girl was taken aback by this, just as Arnold was.<br><br>Sungoods rolled his eyes and explained that they needed to create a comfortable atmosphere for their guest and avoid anything she'd consider offensive. Such as a woman wearing clothes, which was a known taboo in the Sanflarian society.<br><br>â€¶We didn't discuss this,â€¶ the woman's voice became quiet, â€¶I did not agree to this.â€¶<br><br>â€¶You can either do it or we'll continue without ya,â€¶ Sungoods said in a stern voice.<br><br>Arnold flinched a little but continued working. The woman let out a couple of swears, muttered something like â€¶pervertâ€¶ and began undressing. She took off her outer clothing, then got rid of her shoes and reluctantly dropped her pants, revealing alluring red panties. Arnold tried averting his gaze at first, but his fascination with nudity got the better of him, and he began glaring at the smuggler's toned body. She was in her mid-twenties and quite athletic, probably trained for her job. Looked nice in her red underwear too, a nice contrast to the cold steel of the machinery.<br><br>The clerk became short of breath when she took off her bra. Even though she had an A-cup and didn't have much to show, the realization that he was observing a topless woman was enough to make Arnold hard. It became even better when she finally let go of her panties, revealing her pussy with carefully trimmed pubic hair that resembled an arrow.<br><br>â€¶Nice haircut,â€¶ Sungoods jested, clearly enjoying the view.<br><br>â€¶Shut up,â€¶ the woman said, putting her hands on her sides despite the obvious desire to cover herself.<br><br>She now stood in front of her male companions clad in only her mask and a holster attached to her hip.<br><br>â€¶Come, Arnold, take a good look at her to prepare for our guest,â€¶ Sungoods said, â€¶you do know that Sanflarian women consider it rude if you don't admire their looks, right?â€¶<br><br>The girl sighed and turned toward the clerk, then stretched out her arms and legs, allowing him to freely ogle her figure. Arnold thanked her as his cheeks became rosy. She was obviously blushing too, even if it wasn't visible behind her mask. Right after turning 18, Arnold started to often imagine when and how he'd see his first pussy in real life. Sometimes his fantasies were bold, strange, or downright absurd, but this situation surely was crazier than all of them.<br><br>â€¶I'm s-sure I'll be fine,â€¶ the clerk said after a minute.<br><br>â€¶Let's just get this over with!â€¶ The naked smuggler replied, not enjoying this embarrassing show in the slightest.<br><br>Sungoods asked Arnold to hurry up and got into contact with Eleonora. The ICA clerk finished with the codes and launched the sequence, causing the space within the portal to glow in different colors. Soon, a vague silhouette appeared in its light. Arnold worried for a second. What if this wasn't whom they were expecting? Yet, his doubts ended in the very next minute, as the figure stepped closer. The clerk saw Eleonora enter their reality like a goddess of beauty descending into the mortal world.<br><br>The men couldn't help but gaze as the blonde strode forward on her bare feet, with those large breasts and backside of hers hypnotically bouncing along with each step. Finally, Eleonora stopped near the smugglers and put her hair behind her back, her eyes shining with confidence. Arnold let out a gasp, the countess was even more beautiful than in the picture. This really took him by surprise, especially after all the Instagram girls he tried to date in the past.<br><br>â€¶So you are the ones who brought me here, correct?â€¶ The blonde eyed the trio, then stopped at a woman and smiled, showing appreciation<br><br>â€¶Indeed, m'lady,â€¶ Sungoods tipped his stetson.<br><br>Everybody cringed, except for Eleonora, who took this for a strange Earth habit.<br><br>â€¶Good,â€¶ the naked countess said in a surpsingly strong voice, very unlike what Arnold thought she'd sound, â€¶then you all must know why I'm here. Bring me to my cousin this instance, you dirty frauds, or there'll be consequences!â€¶<br><br>The room fell silent as the pressure the air became palpable.<br><br>â€¶W-what?â€¶ Arnold finally asked, unsure what to make of this.<br><br>For a moment, the clerk thought everyone equally confused, but then Sungoods replied:<br><br>â€¶Apologies, sunny, but there's been a change of plans!â€¶<br><br>Before Arnold could react, his â€¶travel buddyâ€¶ pointed his gun at Eleonora with a grin on his face. His naked partner did the same, clearly embarrassed by this situation but forcing herself to go through nonetheless. The clerk glared at the scene in shock, not even sure what to say. He then started screaming at his partners to stop this and urged them to lower their guns. Unfortunately, Sungoods wasn't convinced.<br><br>â€¶Sorry, man, but there's been a change of plans for you as well. I very much empathize with your love story and all that, but this girl is needed elsewhere.â€¶<br><br>Eleonora furrowed her brow and leaned forward a little, as if preparing for a fight. But that'd be crazy since she was one naked woman against two armed criminals. Granted, one of them was also a naked woman herself, but the six shooter in her hands made all the difference.<br><br>â€¶Elsewhere?!â€¶ Arnold yelled, â€¶what do you even mean? What do you even do?!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'm a smuggler, and you already figured that out,â€¶ Sungoods replied. â€¶I mean, most would from my nickname. It's just that I've been thinking about branching out for quite some time. Most of my contraband used to be Sanflarian metal junk for reverse engineering or certain chemicals the government doesn't want here. But, you see, this is an entirely different level. Come now, blondie, the client's waiting for you. And Arnold, I'm sorry that I roped you into this, but we'd never get inside without an ICA guy. It's always sad to lose someone who shares your fetish. I'll miss our DMs.â€¶<br><br>The clerk froze from what he just heard. Not only did his â€¶travel buddyâ€¶ trick him into coming here, but he also planned to kidnap this beauty and commit murder. Arnold's murder, no less! His eyes began darting around the room, trying to find something that could help. He simply couldn't bear the thought of these two leading Eleonora away, locking her up somewhere, and making her cry with their cruelty... But what happened after was even crazier.<br><br>â€¶Easy now, girl, our client is a nice guy who'll treat ya alright,â€¶ Sungoods approached the countess and poked her back with the six-shooter.<br><br>â€¶Oh, it's gonna be easy. For me,â€¶ Eleonora replied and ducked in an instant.<br><br>The smuggler fired but missed and hit the wall. The countess was quicker: she swiftly turned toward him and hit him in the balls with her elbow so hard that he squeaked. Then she raised her leg and kicked the weapon out of his hands in a graceful maneuver. Sungoods pulled out a knife, but Eleonora twisted his arm and got behind his back with snake-like agility, using him as a human shield against his partner's gun.<br><br>â€¶What are you waiting for?! Shoot this bitch!â€¶ The criminal screamed at his naked friend.<br><br>â€¶I... I can't aim that well, stop moving!â€¶ The mask-clad woman shouted in a fit of panic.<br><br>Sungoods continued urging her to take the shot, and eventually she did, hitting him right in the stomach. The naked girl panicked and began yelling. Eleonora used this chance and pushed Sungoods forward. Then the naked girl jumped to the side, her tits eagerly jiggling along, and charged toward the remaining smuggler. Sungood's friend took aim, but the countess' strike sent her pistol flying across the room.<br><br>â€¶No, no, please, he made me do this!â€¶ The girl screamed and tried running away.<br><br>Eleonora was faster yet again and caught her by her dark, short hair. The brunette made a final desperate attempt to get away, but the naked noble put her in a chokehold and knocked her down. Arnold stood there speechless as the girls lied on the floor, their naked bodies tightly pressing against each other, all hot and sweaty from the fight. It could pass for one of the videos the clerk liked watching during sleepless nights, but he still couldn't believe it was all happening before his eyes. Finally, the dark-haired nudie passed out, and Eleonora shifted her attention to Arnold.<br><br>â€¶You're with them, aren't you?â€¶ She quickly leaped back on her feet and menacingly walked toward him, a mixture of strength and beauty in their pure, physical form.<br><br>The clerk began mumbling something and backed away, only to trip on one of the wires and fall down right in front of the naked countess. She walked to him slowly, like a predator who knew that her pray couldn't run anymore. Arnold looked up at her and couldn't help but notice that she looked simply amazing from this angle! Still, his fear and confusion prevailed, as this imposing woman seemed nothing like the kind and submissive Ella Arnold imagined, and he had no idea what to make of her.<br><br>â€¶Ella, please,â€¶ his desperately whispered.<br><br>â€¶I prefer Leo. Now, about my cousin...â€¶ Leo squatted right in front of the guy, enjoying his reaction, â€¶you look like you could help me find him, and something tells me that you will.â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 2", summary: "The Naked and the Afraid", content: "Arnold kept staring at the naked Amazon before him, both allured and terrified, unable even to form a coherent sentence due to his conflicting emotions. Just like during his first date in high school, only this one was even stranger. Eleonora seemed to notice this and, oddly enough, simply put her hands on her knees and waited until the clerk calmed down.<br><br>â€¶Thanks,â€¶ she said with annoyance, but not sarcastically, â€¶my form is known to be remarkable, you're free to watch as long as you want. But don't think that being polite will save you. You were with them, weren't you?â€¶<br><br>Arnold tried explaining that he was tricked by Sungoods just like the countess and didn't mean any harm, but words barely came out of his throat. Still, the blonde seemed to understand at least some of it and toned down the anger.<br><br>â€¶Clearly, you weren't the brain in this scheme,â€¶ she said with a hint of sympathy, â€¶but you still helped them, so you'll have to pay. Now, tell me everything you know about my cousin, you kidnapper!â€¶<br><br>â€¶What? Which cousin?â€¶ Arnold suddenly came to his senses.<br><br>â€¶The one your pathetic world stole from my family! Ugh, I knew that signing the Cooperation Act was wrong. You weaklings simply waited for us to put down our guard, didn't you?â€¶ Leo furrowed her brow once more.<br><br>Before he could answer, the blondie got up and ranted about how Sanflaria shouldn't have trusted a planet that pollutes its own air with fossil fuels, measures power with money, and, worst of all, forces their females to wear clothing and hide their natural beauty. She then repeated her question and grabbed Arnold by his coat, ready to interrogate him. Some would fantasize about this scenario, but the clerk had enough new experiences for today and so told the naked lady everything he knew.<br><br>â€¶I might help through my ICA contacts, but I don't even know whom you are talking about, I swear.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Milran of the Kir'ador Province, sent to your Nevada Province a few days ago to discuss financial matters regarding the new portal. Does that ring a bell?â€¶ Eleonora threw an eager gaze at him, clearly expecting that an interworld agency employee would know at least something.<br><br>And Arnold remembered. Why wouldn't he? Milran was the same noble their higher-ups wouldn't shut up about for the entire week.<br><br>â€¶That's your cousin? But he's supposed to be fine, we provided the best accomodations...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Lies! You robbed and wrongfully imprisoned him!â€¶ Leo put her hands across her boobs, making them seem even bigger and distracting the clerk from her furious words.<br><br>When Arnold managed to reply, he could only ask why she'd even think that.<br><br>â€¶Don't play dumb. I know this because several days ago he sent me a message. Milran said that he was forced to give your people all of his money and was being held in some kind of palace with no exit. He also asked me to find a way to send him more money because his captors demand it! Did you truly expect me to simply let your people hold my kin for ransom?!â€¶<br><br>Between dodging Leo's emotional gestures and staring at her jiggling tits, Arnold barely managed to perceive what she was saying. And even if he did, he doubted it'd make sense. ICA surely would keep an eye on an otherworldly nobleman, making sure nobody could hurt him. Arnold even wanted to ask whether the blonde had the device with the message on her but realized how dumb this question would sound.<br><br>â€¶I'm sorry, I truly don't know what you're talking about, but like I said, I can check through the database,â€¶ the clerk tried reassuring the naked woman, â€¶all of this must be one big misunderstanding.â€¶<br><br>She doubted Arnold's words at first, but something in his anxious demeanor convinced her that even if he was lying, he didn't know about it, so she agreed.<br><br>â€¶Let's not waste any time then. Lead me to your agency, and don't even think about running away or pulling something. If something happens to me, my house will know!â€¶<br><br>â€¶What about them?â€¶ Arnold asked quietly, pointing at the unconscious smugglers.<br><br>â€¶Sure. We indeed have to ensure they won't come after us!â€¶ With these words, the naked girl jumped to Sungoods and began tying him up with loose wires.<br><br>Then she did the same thing to his companion, who now looked especially silly lying on the floor only clad in wires and a mask. Then, Eleonora got up and casually walked to the entrance. Meanwhile, Arnold checked on his former â€¶buddyâ€¶ and saw that his vest took the bullet, and he probably just fainted from shock. So much for a fearless criminal. The clerk considered taking one of the six shooters but realized it'd not look right if he got caught with it.<br><br>â€¶So, uh, you've planned for this all along? I thought you were happy to come here! With your hearts and all,â€¶ Arnold asked, still a bit confused by Leo's cold behavior.<br><br>â€¶Hearts?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, yeah, when you wrote him that's you're coming...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Those were not hearts. I sent you pikes, showing that whoever is responsible for my cousin's peril will suffer! That's why I told you to prepare,â€¶ she humphed.<br><br>Arnold wanted to blame Sungoods for misreading this girl's intentions so poorly but couldn't since he fell into the same trap. So he simply followed his new naked friend, still shaking his head to make sure all of this was real. But then they reached the stairs. Arnold saw her majestic ass up close and realized that those questions were meaningless. Testosterone kicked in again, and the clerk's main priority became helping this naked girl out. After all, wasn't it what he wanted from the beginning?<br><br>The two left the house and walked into the desert. Leo continued to freely go forward, not caring about the cold winds or the rough dirt beneath her tender feet. It truly seemed like she was determined to walk right up to the ICA headquarters. There was a problem though; one Arnold only dared to voice once they reached the road.<br><br>â€¶Um, the office doesn't work at night. We'll have to wait until morning.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Hm, I hope it's not some trick of yours,â€¶ the blonde stared into the distance.<br><br>â€¶Not at all,â€¶ Arnold hurried, â€¶although my administrator says the same thing when I remind her that the workday's over.â€¶<br><br>The joke didn't land, and the clerk fell silent again. This didn't go according to plan at all, the only thing left was to improvise. The two discussed what to do next since they were in the middle of nowhere and Arnold's home was in miles. Leo tried looking strong at first, but eventually yawned and confessed that she didn't have an easy day either, so some rest would be appreciated.<br><br>â€¶Don't you have one of those dirty smoke vehicles of yours? Cars?â€¶ The blonde asked with pressure.<br><br>â€¶I... Actually got here by bus, and the last one was about an hour ago.â€¶<br><br>The girl humphed with disappointment. Indeed, just like in high school. But there was no time for drama, so the duo went toward the town, with Leo commanding the clerk to come up with some ideas along the way. Then she suddenly pulled Arnold closer and began walking arm in arm with him.<br><br>â€¶What are you...â€¶ The clerk's cheeks got rosy again.<br><br>â€¶Making sure you won't just run away and abandon me here,â€¶ she explained.<br><br>Arnold didn't protest. Mostly because of Leo's dominant attitude, but also because it just felt nice to walk with a naked girl like that. They didn't know where they were going at first, but then settled on a 24/7 diner nearby, lured by its flickering neon burger. There was only one patron inside, some old man eating either his dinner or breakfast.<br><br>An elderly woman was cleaning a colorful counter while a waitress was dozing off nearby. The clerk became anxious imagining these three seeing the naked countess, but this thought also felt oddly enjoyable, like he's got a front row seat on one of those public nudity videos. The blonde herself didn't seem to mind at all, confident and proud of her nakedness.<br><br>â€¶Wow girl, you go!â€¶ A raspy voice said with a whistle even before the duo walked in.<br><br>It turned out to be a homeless guy ogling Leo from across the street. The noble smiled while Arnold hurried to get into the diner. He could only imagine how much ruckus the girl's nudity will cause when she'll have no one, but dozens of spectators. The old woman gasped in surprise when Arnold and his new companion walked up the the counter.<br><br>â€¶Uh, hello, we're just here for a late night snack, pay us no mind.â€¶<br><br>â€¶That's right, we're here for your food!â€¶ Leo said like it was a threat.<br><br>The old lady shrugged.<br><br>â€¶Could've at least put a dressing gown on before going out, but that's none of my business. Order, please.â€¶<br><br>Arnold chose the least unappeling item on the menu, which turned out to be a regular burger, and asked for some tea to go with it. The two walked past the row of seats and tables to find a clean one. Leo stepped slowly, letting the old man enjoy her looks as she passed him. A large grin appeared on the man's face and he even stopped eating for a minute.<br><br>â€¶The youth knows how to have fun nowadays,â€¶ he said with a chuckle, causing Arnold to nod awkwardly.<br><br>Finally, the two found a nice place and sat facing each other. The clerk wanted to offer the countess some paper or even his coat to sit on, but she just landed her majestic ass right on that old bench without a second thought, proving her bravery once again. Their meal took some time, especially considering the cook kept peeking out of the kitchen to gaze at the noblewoman's breasts, so the two had time to talk.<br><br>The countess was still pretty hostile, as she seemed to think that everyone around her was working for the mysterious kidnappers. Arnold decided to play along for now and use this opportunity to learn a bit more about the naked countess. Who knows, maybe it all still could work out.<br><br>â€¶Your English is quite good, by the way,â€¶ Arnold gave her a compliment.<br><br>It was true, too. Leo didn't seem to make any mistakes, to the contrary of most Sanflarians, and while her accent was noticeable, it was soft and only added charm to her speech.<br><br>â€¶Thanks, I'm not proud of it.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Why is that?â€¶<br><br>â€¶The first portal opened four years before I was born, so my parents made me learn it to communicate with your world as a noblewoman. I never understood why we couldn't just keep living like we did before, but they know better, so I obliged.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, um, I'm sure they had your best interests in mind. Y'know, there are plenty of trade and projects that benefit both of our nations... It's good, right?â€¶<br><br>Leo was having none of this positive talk, all of her focus was on that poor cousin of hers. The clerk reasurred her once more, even though he already realized that words won't be enough and she'll need proof to believe him. Finally, the burgers arrived. But when the sleepy waitress approached the table, she suddenly stopped.<br><br>â€¶Wait...â€¶ she blinked, looking at the naked woman, â€¶have I woken up, or is it like, one of those dreams when you're naked, but instead of me it's you?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I can assure you that I'm very real,â€¶ the countess replied, highling her breasts by crossing her arms, â€¶but if I were you, I'd consider taking this blue rag off, it covers all of the best parts.â€¶<br><br>This wasn't entirely wrong. The waitress was a young, Latino woman with an attractive hourglass figure, but her plain blue dress hid most of it from view. Still, she wasn't convinced and simply put the food in front of the duo. The countess went a step further though: she decided to check the dress out by pulling its hem up, revealing the girl's legs and white panties. The dress' owner nearly spilled tea on herself as she stepped away.<br><br>â€¶Stop! I can't just go around naked like you, I'm not that shameless,â€¶ the waitress exclaimed as she left their table.<br><br>â€¶Poor thing,â€¶ Leo simply shook her head and began eating.<br><br>Arnold found the burgers to be surprisingly decent, but observing the naked blonde eat in front of him was even better. She had a nice posture and table manners that contrasted with her blatant nakedness. They talked a bit more, and the atmosphere finally got a bit more relaxed. The only problem was that the clerk's phone died, so he couldn't call a taxi or even open the map.<br><br>â€¶I hope it's not poison,â€¶ Leo said half-seriously as she bit into the burger.<br><br>â€¶Well, um, not entirely,â€¶ the clerk replied with doubt in his voice.<br><br>The tasty meal eased Leo's tamper a little, and she waited until Arnold got directions with no issues. It turned out, there was a motel nearby, and while sleeping there wouldn't be luxurious, it was better than the street. When he called her, the countess got up and did a couple stretches to prepare for the road. Arnold wanted to note that some may consider it impolite, but realized that most people won't even notice it due to the nudity.<br><br>â€¶I'll pay. Uh, unless you want to split the bill or...â€¶<br><br>The countess slapped her bare hips where the pockets would be, stating the obvious.<br><br>â€¶Oh, right. Sorry.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Ha, it's alright, at least I'm not afraid of thieves,â€¶ The blonde smirked, glancing at the other females.<br><br>The duo left the diner with everyone's eyes following Leo's bare behind as she walked out to the night street. It took them five minutes to reach the motel, and a couple more people saw the duo walk arm in arm on the road. They mostly didn't react at all, probably questioning whether that girl in the dark was actually naked. A car passed Eleonora by near their destination, illuminating her gorgeous form with its headlights. The driver honked as he drove away, this probably made his night.<br><br>â€¶H-hello, we'd like a room, please,â€¶ Arnold approached the dimly lit counter.<br><br>A large, bald man turned around and glared at the naked woman for a second. He didn't comment on it, but simply gave them the key and said typical stuff about the motel's rules and breakfast in the morning. Only when Leo went to the staircase, the owner called the clerk up and said:<br><br>â€¶She's a hot thing, but I think you're a bit too young for those kinds of services, kid. Find yourself a real girlfriend who'll love you!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, it's, uh, it's not what you think, we...â€¶<br><br>Then the clerk heard Leo's voice calling from upstairs and ran away, escaping the man's judgmental look. The key swiftly opened the rusty lock, and the two saw exactly what was expected. The place was cramped, the furniture looked century-old, and there was an odd smell in the air, the source of which neither of them wanted to guess.<br><br>Arnold invited the countess in with a sigh. She said it was her first time visiting Earth, and the clerk didn't know what it'd take to fix this impression. There was also only one bed, but Leo saved Arnold from awkwardness by taking her sheets and moving them to the floor.<br><br>â€¶Oh, you don't need to...â€¶ he tried to be a gentleman.<br><br>â€¶Sleeping on the floor is healthy and builds character,â€¶ the blonde replied, â€¶and what are you waiting for? Come here.â€¶<br><br>The brunet was taken aback by her words. A second before, he was sure she wanted to leave him the bed, but it turned out the girl's plan was entirely different.<br><br>â€¶I need to be sure you won't pull something or run away during the night. You've been quite useful today, but that might be a mere attempt to trick me. We'll sleep near one another and without blankets, so I can be sure I'll see you tomorrow.â€¶<br><br>This girl surely had trust issues. But once again, Arnold didn't protest and slowly moved his sheets to the blonde. The clerk shyly lied beside the girl, not sure whether to be happy or intimidated. Turning around, he felt his hormones taking control once more, as the view of Leo's feminine curves in the moonlight was something he could only dream of seeing before.<br><br>â€¶Won't you be cold without a blanket?â€¶ The clerk finally asked.<br><br>â€¶No, not at all. I know a perfect way to keep us warm.â€¶<br><br>Arnold didn't even have time to ask what it was, as Eleonora decided to demonstrate it right away: the naked girl urged the man to take off his shirt, then pulled him up close, tightly pressing her body to his. The clerk felt the warmth and softness of her skin all around his torso, while his face got right in-between her boobs. He instantly got hard and became short of breath, not ready for this excitement at all.<br><br>â€¶Now we'll share our body heat and sleep just fine. Trust me, I've been doing it with other girls since forever,â€¶ the naked girl said confidently, enveloping the clerk's body with her strong arms.<br><br>â€¶Mmhphmfp,â€¶ Arnold replied, his voice muffled by the girl's curvy chest.<br><br>The blonde didn't quite get that, but she knew that even if he was protesting, deep down he enjoyed this far more than she did. They tussled and turned for a bit, but then fell asleep in each other's arms, with Arnold's head on Leo's breast as if it were a pillow. It was difficult to fall asleep with his boner at first, but soon the exhaustion took over and he closed his eyes, dreaming of naked girls and shiny portals." },
      { title: "Chapter 3", summary: "Shameless Sunny Show", content: "When the clerk got up in the morning, their floor bed was empty, and he was alone. Arnold almost believed he imagined the yesterday evening, but the feelings were too real, and he was still in the motel, which looked even worse in daylight. Unsure of what to think, the clerk went to the bathroom but stopped right after opening the door.<br><br>â€¶Hello again, my hostage. I hope you're ready, we'll travel to your office first thing today,â€¶ the countess was standing in the shower, enjoying the water running down her naked curves while the curtain remained in the corner like a useless rag.<br><br>The clerk wanted to avert his gaze, but then giggled at himself and greeted the girl back. Soon, they switched places, although Arnold's naked companion quickly left the bathroom before he began undressing, and he still closed the curtain for comfort. It was interesting to see how nonchalant Leo was about showing off but respectful of male modesty at the same time. Arnold liked Sanflarian culture more and more with each day.<br><br>Then came breakfast, during which Leo's body again became the center of everyone's attention. The duo sat nearby since the countess was determined to keep her â€¶hostageâ€¶ close, and, once again, he didn't protest. Others noticed Eleonora too, particularly when she paraded around the dining area with her tray. There were less than a dozen people here, and surprisingly, nobody seemed to have a problem with the naked girl.<br><br>Everyone tried to look like they were just minding their own business, but Arnold could tell most of the men threw horny gazes at the countess and even snapped pictures. Leo was like a star among fans and probably thought that the attention was due to her noble origin, even though nobody here even knew who she was. Finally, the two left this mediocre place and prepared to walk out on the street.<br><br>â€¶Uh, maybe you wait while I catch a cab?â€¶ Arnold gently grabbed Leo's hand.<br><br>â€¶Why is that?â€¶ She raised her eyebrow.<br><br>How could he put it? While the clerk enjoyed seeing a confident, naked woman, he wasn't sure the general public would as well. He considered just letting her show off at first, but now, after he let out some steam in the shower, his thinking became more clear, and he realized that most US citizens were probably not ready for this culture shock.<br><br>â€¶I mean... You're not wearing clothes, and, well, I mean, some might see issues with it?â€¶ Arnold tried to soften this as much as possible.<br><br>It didn't work.<br><br>â€¶You're seriously asking me to hide my body because your people are afraid of seeing a woman? And that's after you insulted my family by kidnapping my cousin? The nerve!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Listen, I told you already, it's unlikely anyone kidnapped...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Look!â€¶ Leo confidently walked outside with the clerk close behind.<br><br>Before Arnold could react, the girl sat on the motel's sign and spread her legs as wide as she could. The street wasn't too crowded, but there was a fair share of passersby, all of whom turned their heads toward this sexy sight. Leo didn't wait and leaned backward, then raised her long, bare legs into the air, showing off her entire body like a shameless stripper. The countess' pussy attracted stares, whistles, and mobile cameras from everyone around her. Arnold was one of them while his horniness and common sense battled each other.<br><br>â€¶Wow, look at that chick, she's so hot!â€¶ some dude shouted to his buddies.<br><br>â€¶What a slut,â€¶ a minidress-clad girl scoffed, clearly angered by the sudden competition.<br><br>â€¶Must be a dare,â€¶ a middle-aged man looked at her with a hint of sympathy.<br><br>Arnold finally got hold of himself and intervened, apologizing and suggesting they hurry up to find her cousin.<br><br>â€¶And that's how I feel about your rules! Hopefully I won't have to explain twice,â€¶ Eleonora jiggled her breasts, full of cockiness.<br><br>The clerk urged her to calm down and proposed to catch a ride. They could've also gone by bus, but using public transport could've caused even more trouble. At first, the guy tried hitchhiking himself while Leo waited on the sidewalk, but soon realized that the girl's shamelessness might actually be useful here. Nobody wanted to stop for some weird, pale-skinned dude in a dark coat.<br><br>â€¶Just hold your finger like... Yeah, like this, and stand over here. I'm sure you'll attract more attention than I did,â€¶ he said and finished with an awkward laugh.<br><br>And so Leo stood, hitchiking naked on the side of the road. The sun caressed her amazing body while her mane fluttered in the summer breeze. Who wouldn't want to stop for such a passenger? It soon turned out that some people didn't, because the blonde had to stand like this for several long minutes with no luck. The drivers honked, shouted compliments, and even tried slapping her butt from their windows, but all of them passed her by.<br><br>Arnold was shocked but quickly found an explanation: most guys thought it was some kind of prank or a social experiment. Nobody believed a butt-ass-naked knockout would both need a ride and risk to get it like that. One guy was an exception, but as soon as he hit the brakes, his wife began nagging on him and forced him to drive away even faster than before.<br><br>â€¶How much longer will it take? I can't take this anymore, the smoke your machines put out is disgusting,â€¶ the blonde coughed so loudly that a couple of guys rushed to her, asking whether she was alright, clearly with no ulterior motives in mind.<br><br>â€¶I mean, I expected it to be smoother, but once I stood like this for half an hour and...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Half an hour?! Oh no, we haven't got the time! I hope you can at least drive.â€¶ Leo cracked her knuckles like a trained fighter.<br><br>Arnold could drive, but he couldn't understand why it was relevant if he didn't have a car. But he understood the next minute, when Eleonora, her legs at shoulder-width and her arms outstrched, stepped right onto the road like she was trying to stop the next car by force.<br><br>â€¶W-what are you doing? Get away from the road!â€¶ Arnold shouted, his voice filled with panic.<br><br>A red vintage convertible was approaching the naked blonde at a rapid speed. The clerk froze, already imagining the gruesome collision of the metal and her tender flesh. But when he closed his eyes, he heard the sound of brakes, then the man's laughter and a conversation. The clerk saw a man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, who clearly enjoyed Leo's bold hitchhiking tactic. Especially after the girl leaned over his car's door to talk to him, providing a great view on her boobs.<br><br>â€¶Wow, ya need a ride girl! I can let ya ride something even better than this!â€¶ he began laughing at his own vulgar joke.<br><br>There was something wrong with this guy. His speech was slurry, and his pupils were dilated. Arnold knew that seeing a nude hottie in public could cause many weird things to people, but surely not this.<br><br>â€¶Are you on drugs?â€¶ the clerk asked awkwardly.<br><br>The driver stopped for a moment and tilted his head, as if not understanding the letters in his words.<br><br>â€¶Well... I had two bags of grass, seventy-five...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Alright, we'll be glad to hear this later. But right now, I'm commandeering your vehicle!â€¶ Leo said and swiftly grabbed the druggie by his clothes.<br><br>Arnold silently watched as she opened the car's door and drugged its owner out. Then, the blonde jumped onto the passenger's seat, much to the shock of both the clerk and everyone else around them.<br><br>â€¶Are you going to stand there all day?â€¶ the countess asked with agitation.<br><br>â€¶Whoa, not cool, man.â€¶ The driver spun his head around like a snake near a flute, probably not even grasping what just happened.<br><br>There was no time to think. Arnold looked over the passersby, then sat on the driver's seat and slammed the gas pedal in an adrenaline rush.<br><br>â€¶Good, finally you figured it out,â€¶ Leo said with a cocky grin.<br><br>The naked girl, clearly satisfied with herself, stretched out her arms and put her legs on the front panel, letting her bare feet touch the windshield. Arnold, on the other hand, was still in panic mode, acting on a pure instinct. He couldn't decide whether they just committed a crime by stealing a car or, to the contrary, prevented a DUI charge. In any case, this much initiative was new to him and seemed terrifying.<br><br>â€¶You can't just do that to people, y-you know. We're not criminals!â€¶ the clerk blurted out.<br><br>â€¶Oh, big deal. We'll return it after getting to our destination. It's not the worst thing in the world. After all, I already stole you before this,â€¶ she chuckled.<br><br>The brunet had no idea whether that was supposed to demean or motivate him, but he was already in too deep to worry about that. Hopefully, ICA will understand and help him deal with the consequences... At least as long as he doesn't tell them where Sungoods got the codes, of course.<br><br>â€¶Nice tits, baby!â€¶ a cyclist yelled at Leo, to which she waved back, clearly flattered.<br><br>Ah yes, the clerk nearly forgot about her nakedness for a second. As they drove through the streets in broad daylight, Leo attracted the attention of both drivers and pedestrians all around her. Even though the Interworld Cooperation Act was signed months ago, Sanflarian girls were still a rarity on Earth, so nobody would even think that Leo was an alien.<br><br>The fact that they were in a convertible and Leo's shameless pose made the situation even better for all the gawkers. Especially when they stopped during traffic lights. One or more folks would suddenly remember that they needed to tie their shoe or text somebody right in the middle of the crossing.<br><br>â€¶You seem to enjoy the attention quite a bit,â€¶ Arnold couldn't help but notice.<br><br>â€¶I must admit, it is nice to see that many of you aren't afraid of showing your appreciation of female form. It makes me wonder why you make your women wear all those rags in the first place. And what can I say? Every girl likes to receive compliments, that's just in our nature,â€¶ she smiled.<br><br>â€¶But aren't some of those comments... Vulgar?â€¶<br><br>Leo raised her eyebrows again. Clearly, she didn't understand it at all. Arnold explained that you couldn't just walk up to an Earth woman and say that she has nice tits, that'd be inappropriate. This confused the countess even more, and she asked why it would be bad to point out someone's attractiveness.<br><br>â€¶So, Sanflarians compliment you like this all the time?â€¶ The clerk tried distracting himself from the chaos they were in.<br><br>â€¶Not always. Men in my world are far less interested in our bodies than your kind is. But that makes the comments we do get even cuter! Although I'll agree that the tits one is a bit bland. If you truly want to boost a girl's self-esteem, comment on her ass. Breasts are gifted to us by mother nature, but a good-looking butt requires hard work.â€¶<br><br>Arnold nodded, realizing that their cultures had even more differences than he originally thought. It made sense: you won't get obsessed with naked females if you see dozens of them every single day. For a moment, the clerk was jealous of Leo's people, but then questioned whether that'd make his fetish feel uninteresting. The time quickly passed with their talk and catcalls from the passersby, and the duo found themselves near Arnold's workplace.<br><br>â€¶Alright, I'll go in there and find everything I can about Milran. Just wait for me here and...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Wait for you here? Why would I?â€¶ Leo got up and skillfully jumped out of the car without opening a door. â€¶How can I be sure you won't just run to your higher-ups and abandon me here? Oh no, I'm going with you!â€¶<br><br>The brunet tried explaining how hard it would be to get her in, how his administrator would get angry, and how there were a ton of other reasons for him to enter alone. However, Leo just grabbed his arm and said she's not going anywhere until she gets proof that Milran is safe and sound. He couldn't beat this kind of argument, especially not with the blonde's hot body pressing against his coat as she stood beside him.<br><br>â€¶Alright, we'll figure something out,â€¶ the man sighed and walked in along with Leo, who smiled proudly.<br><br>The sliding door in front of them opened and let them into a governmental office building with white walls and fake plants all over the floor, placed to bring at least some color into the employees' monotonous lives. The first person they met was a bulky, broad-shouldered security guard, who was somehow less surprised to see a naked knockout in front of him. Probably because he knew more about Sanflarian women than the regular civilians. Still, it didn't mean he was going to let her in.<br><br>â€¶This is a carefully guarded facility. State the purpose of your arrival,â€¶ he furrowed his brow.<br><br>Arnold explained that the shameless girl with him is the young countess of Kir'ador, and they were on an urgent diplomatic mission.<br><br>â€¶I'm here for my cousin Milran, although I prefer to call him my brother. Let me in now or suffer consequences!â€¶ The blonde raised her voice, destroying all of the clerk's efforts with one sentence.<br><br>The guard let out a laugh, clearly not convinced. By then it's like something clicked inside his head. He must've remembered the name of that noble after hearing it a hundred times during the last few days.<br><br>â€¶Alright, but it's gonna be a standard procedure. I'll have to make sure you're not carrying illegal items.â€¶<br><br>With these words, the guard began waving a metal detector around Arnold. It didn't take longer than a couple minutes, and the bulky man switched his attention to Leo. He obviously joked, saying that he'll have to frisk her as well per protocol, but she misunderstood and did something neither men could expect.<br><br>â€¶Alright, I have nothing to hide, so go ahead.â€¶<br><br>The blonde shrugged, then suddenly turned around and bent over, landing her hands on her backside. In a swift move, she grabbed her buttcheeks and spread them as far as she could, confidently showing off her pussy and anus. The guard was taken aback by this move and even blushed a little, unable to stop staring at her gorgeous behind. The clerk hurried explain the joke.<br><br>â€¶Gods, make up your mind!â€¶ Leo threw an annoyed gaze at the man and strolled toward the reception.<br><br>Arnold followed her with an awkward giggle. He couldn't blame the girl for embarrassing the guard, as she just understood the concept of frisking in her own way. Clearly, the mandatory nudity of Sanflarian females left them with only a couple places to hide illegal items, so the conclusion Leo jumped to wasn't strange at all. Their next task was taking to a lady at the reception, where Arnold had to clock in.<br><br>â€¶Alright, it'll be quick, just let me handle this, o-okay?â€¶ the clerk whispered.<br><br>Leo agreed for once and waited, leaning on the desk. The employees turned their heads as they passed her by. The men's eyes were filled with both admiration and anger at their strict schedule that didn't let them stop and strike a conversation. The Sanflarian was going to get a lot of thirsty gazes here: a good chunk of men went to ICA for the sole purpose of tying their career with naked girls, only to realize that these two things had nothing in common aside from occasional pictures they'd see while searching through the database.<br><br>â€¶Thanks for coming, Lady Eleonora, we hope you have a nice stay,â€¶ the middle-aged woman said in a mechanical voice, so tired of this job that even Leo couldn't surprise her.<br><br>â€¶It depends on the stay Milran has here,â€¶ the countess replied.<br><br>Arnold worked on the fourth floor and suggested they use an elevator. As soon as he said it, he noticed a bunch of clerks rushing inside of the cabin, as if taking the front row seats before a show. However, Leo disappointed them by taking the stairs to â€¶stretch her legs a little.â€¶ The clerk was fine with that, especially once he started running closely behind his naked companion, enjoying the view on her jiggling backside.<br><br>Finally, they reached Arnold's office, with cubicles and detached workers all around them. A couple women gasped when they saw Leo, while the middle-aged men drinking their coffee gave the clerk nods of approval. The brunet reached his computer and started typing away, hopeful to find everything he needs before Debrah finished her 10th donut in the office kitchen. Leo observed his actions very carefully, spreading her legs shoulder-width and leaning on the table, which created a very suggestive view for Klara, a clerk whose workplace was right beside Arnold's.<br><br>This was a mistake, as Leo reacted right away by turning around and staring down the unfortunate employee.<br><br>â€¶Do you have a problem?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, yes, your ass is right in front of my face,â€¶ Klara replied.<br><br>â€¶And?â€¶<br><br>The female clerk sighed.<br><br>â€¶I know that you Sanflarians aren't afraid of being all out there, but I mean, it's our world, maybe you could follow our customs for a bit? I heard they recently made hypoallergenic clothes for you girls to wear.â€¶<br><br>Leo scoffed. Of course, she heard about it too. And just like half of other Sanflarian women, she seemingly took this offer as an insult to her dignity as a woman. This shouldn't have been surprising since the countess was so patriotic and loving of Sanflarian culture, she even refused to wear shoes, jewelry, or any other accessories, which made her look naked even by her own people's standards.<br><br>â€¶How about I show you OUR customs for a change and rid you of these clothes here and now?â€¶ the blonde approached Karla and bent forward, covering the girl's view with her large breasts.<br><br>â€¶W-what? Oh, no-no-no, you've misunderstood, to each their own, I guess, he-he.â€¶ Klara's confidence evaporated in seconds, and she nervously looked away, conceding to the blonde's pressure.<br><br>â€¶Good,â€¶ Leo smirked, savoring her little victory.<br><br>Arnold didn't react to this aggressive yet sexy conflict. He was too busy searching through all the data he could find. His hands became sweaty as he typed faster and faster, not getting anything in return. Then he realized that he already found everything he could about Milran, and that was useless, general information that he already knew. The nobleman's route, the place of his stay, and other details were omitted. Nobody in ICA trusted a bunch of poorly trained clerks with confidential matters.<br><br>â€¶Well? What's the hold-up?â€¶ the blonde looked at the screen from right over his head.<br><br>The clerk felt goosebumps covering his skin when Leo's tits landed right on his neck. Too bad he had to disappoint his sexy companion once again.<br><br>â€¶It's... Not here,â€¶ he finally conceded, â€¶the data about Milran's whereabouts is not in the general database. It must only be accesible for higher-ups.â€¶<br><br>Higher-ups like Debrah, Arnold added in his mind. He grimaced like he just ate an entire lemon. Just talking to his administrator was enough pain, but asking her for help? The duo would probably have more luck with the central ICA headquarters in D.C. The clerk kept pressing the keyboard keys if by inertia while the weight of Leo's boobs on his back became heavier and heavier. Suddenly, he felt her tender yet strong hands envelop his chest while feeling her warm breathing on his neck. The men drinking their coffee gave the clerk more nods while he tried guessing how soon he'd need another shower.<br><br>â€¶So, what are we going to do next?â€¶ she asked, looking him right in the eyes, â€¶I'm sure you have an idea, right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, I mean... We could...â€¶ Arnold began talking while coming up with a new implausible plan.<br><br>â€¶Arnold!!! What is the meaning of this?!â€¶<br><br>The clerk turned out and gasped. Debrah was staying in the doorway like a monster from a horror movie, looking at him from behind her glasses while cleaning her sweater from the pastry crumbs.<br><br>â€¶Oh, good day! I was just working on... Educating my coworkers on Sanflarian culture?â€¶ he said with a silly smile.<br><br>â€¶My office. Now!â€¶ the administrator said as she left the room, closing the door behind her so loudly that everyone flinched.<br><br>The colleagues glanced at Arnold and his companion again, but this time with less surprise and more pity, as if this was the last time they were going to see him. The clerk gulped and began packing his things. He realized they still had a couple of minutes before Debrah realized Arnold wasn't coming, and this time would be enough to take the elevator and escape the building. The only thing left was to tell this to Leo, but once the clerk raised his head, he saw her walking right into Debrah's office, hypnotizing the male employees with her beautiful hips.<br><br>â€¶Finally somebody who'll tell us everything we need to know,â€¶ the countess remarked as she opened the door, â€¶follow me.â€¶<br><br>Arnold sank into his seat as he watched the blonde enter that room with no second thoughts. For a moment, he just wanted to escape, file for resignation, and never step foot into this office again. But then he remembered Leo's graceful body, her warm breathing, and the softness of her breasts. He couldn't just turn back now. That beautiful, naked countess still needed his help, and he had to provide it. Maybe then his dream about their romantic adventure will get closer to becoming a reality, even if he already lost hope for it.<br><br>â€¶I'm coming,â€¶ Arnold entered the room with a meek whisper, preparing for a disaster." },
      { title: "Chapter 4", summary: "The Unstoppable Force", content: "Arnold saw Debrah sitting at her desk and staring at Leo with suspicion. The naked countess boldly approached the administrator until her bare legs stood right beside Debrah's table. The clerk let out an awkward laugh, already thinking where he could apply for his next job.<br><br>â€¶Well, do I have to ask this again? Tell me about my cousin!â€¶ The blonde put her hands on her hips, creating an even more alluring image.<br><br>If Debrah was a man, she'd surely give Leo Milran's whereabouts, his guards' numbers, and even the codes to all portals in Nevada. Instead, she turned her attention to Arnold and furrowed her brow.<br><br>â€¶I feel like you've got some explaining to do, aren't you?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Don't you dare ignore the countess of Kir'ador!â€¶ The naked girl's shout eachoed through the room.<br><br>Before anyone could react, Leo jumped into the air in a furious yet elegant feat. Her feet landed right atop Debrah's desk, and now the naked blonde was squatting in front of the administrator, both showing herself off and preparing to grab her by that old tacky sweater if need be.<br><br>â€¶Remove your dirty feet from my documents, you freak!â€¶ Debrah yelled, ready to call security.<br><br>Leo caught her hand in mid-air and let out a satisfied grin.<br><br>â€¶Only after I learn everything I need, you textile pile,â€¶ the blonde replied.<br><br>Arnold's eyes widened from this scene, yet he couldn't help but feel vindicated for all the suffering Debrah has caused him during the past year. Still, the clerk felt it was time to break them up, so he rushed to the women right when they were about to start exchanging blows. Of course, the first couple of blows still flew out, and both of them hit Arnold, but the clerk managed to stop the women while ouching from pain.<br><br>â€¶P-please, stop, I... I can explain everything!â€¶ Arnold yelled and fell silent right after, imagining how weird it must've sounded to other clerks.<br><br>After some deep breaths and a glass of water, the clerk managed to tell Debrah about his naked companion, her mission, and how he was trying to help her. Obviously, he omitted the details about getting Sungoods the codes. Instead, the clerk told her a fascinating tale about trying to stop a criminal who stole ICA data and who was now tied up at the abandoned facility, ready to be apprehended. Debrah calmly listened to his scuffed speech, then leaned back on her chair and began rubbing her temples.<br><br>â€¶Well, that doesn't give her an excuse to stand on my desk,â€¶ she finally retorted, â€¶but... I see that it's indeed an ICA problem. I just don't understand why you couldn't keep your head down and let others handle it, Arnold.â€¶<br><br>Meanwhile, Leo left the table, but only after landing her bare butt right on Debrah's office appliances and causing her to cringe. Arnold could tell the administrator was about to lash out again, but learning Leo's high position eased her temper. So instead, she chose diplomacy:<br><br>â€¶Lady Eleonora, I'm sure my employee is right, and there's nothing to worry about in Milran's case. I think it's better to notify your parents and escort you to the nearest portal to protect you from harm.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I've already proven I can protect myself,â€¶ Leo looked at Arnold with a smile.<br><br>The clerk confirmed it, remembering the terror on Sungoods' face that was visible even through his mask.<br><br>â€¶Besides,â€¶ the blonde raised her voice again, â€¶why should I trust any of your governmental agency talk if you were the ones who couldn't keep my cousin safe in the first place?! He claimed he's being held in a palace with no exit, and someone from your nation is demanding money from him!â€¶<br><br>Debrah raised her eyebrows, then suddenly turned to her computer as if remembering something she forgot a long time ago. Leo ran up to see it too, much to Debrah's discomfort due to having to share her personal space and seeing that pair of boobs right before her eyes.<br><br>â€¶I think I know what he was talking about... At least partially. It must be about Caesar's Palace, the hotel in which he chose to stay before the meeting,â€¶ the administrator pulled up some information, after which Arnold cautiously looked into the screen as well.<br><br>There was a map with a red line painted across the roads and streets of Las Vegas. It must've been Milran's route to the hotel, during which, according to Debrah, there were no accidents. Leo kept suggesting something must've happened later, to which the administrator proposed to call Milran right now and make sure he's okay. Arnold breathed a sigh of relief at first, but then realized that Milran wasn't responding to the call. They phoned him once, twice, and thrice, but it didn't even seem like the calls went through.<br><br>â€¶Odd.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Maybe he forgot to charge his phone?â€¶ Arnold whispered.<br><br>â€¶His device works on a solar battery crafted in Sanflaria and is capable of holding charge for a week of constant usage!â€¶ Leo protested, â€¶I told you there was something wrong with him.â€¶<br><br>Debrah tried convincing the blonde that Milran must've been busy or lost his phone. She didn't believe it herself, of course, but was still hoping to make the countess go away so ICA could figure this out without a scandal. Too bad Leo didn't believe her words and forced the woman to give her the address and room number, so she could check on Milran herself. While Debrah wasn't supposed to give out such confidential information, she was also taught to satisfy the needs of high-ranking Sanflarian nobles, and today the latter seemed much more important than the former.<br><br>â€¶Of course, Lady Eleonora, our best employees will escort you to Caesar's Palace, where you'll meet your cousin in person.â€¶<br><br>â€¶And I will...â€¶ Arnold tried interjecting.<br><br>â€¶And you will go back to your workplace and finish with the emails! You've already made a mess of things.â€¶<br><br>The clerk fell silent and lowered his head, but not after throwing a glance at the majestic blonde for what he thought would be the last time. Indeed, it didn't matter what he said, Debrah would never trust him with such an important mission. The only thing that was left is returning to his boring office reality, where the only naked women he'll see will be on the news article illustrations. Yet, after he made the first step, Leo grabbed him and pulled him close.<br><br>â€¶Arnold?! What the hell are you doing?!â€¶ Debrah got up from her seat as she saw the clerk's body pressing against Leo's.<br><br>Arnold would like to defend himself very much but couldn't say a word since Leo pushed his face right into one of her boobs. He could barely process what happened, but his body already reacted with excitement that was visible even through his pants.<br><br>â€¶Hold on! I didn't say he could leave!â€¶ The blonde said with pressure.<br><br>â€¶You... want to travel with him? Him?!â€¶<br><br>Leo nodded while Arnold freed himself from the â€¶boobyâ€¶ trap and looked at the countess with even more surprise. The blonde explained that while Debrah might trust her best employees more, the countess couldn't, so she won't let ICA select staff to take her anywhere. Instead, she'll opt for the help of Arnold, who's already proven his loyalty to her.<br><br>The blonde didn't question whether this feeling was based on his honor, fear, or horniness since it was fine either way. Debrah fell back into her chair after hearing the news, and for a second, Arnold thought she fainted. But she wouldn't make it in ICA if she couldn't deal with the unexpected.<br><br>â€¶Lady Eleonora, I understand your points, but I must urge you to reconsider,â€¶ Debrah finally looked up. â€¶ICA wants to guarantee your safety... But with him, we just can't.â€¶<br><br>Arnold frowned and was already preparing to respond, unable to take this abuse any longer, yet Leo cut him off.<br><br>â€¶No worries, I'll guarantee it myself. Don't be afraid for your employee either, I'll bring him back safe and sound. As long as he does what I say,â€¶ the blonde glanced at her companion with an odd smirk.<br><br>Debrah made a couple more attempts to convince Leo, but soon gave up and let the blonde have her way. That's how Arnold was assigned the important task of escorting the countess to Caesar's Palace, which could've brought him ample career opportunities if done correctly and lots of trouble otherwise. Debrah decided to emphasize the last part and grabbed Arnold by his coat when he was leaving.<br><br>â€¶Remember: if something happens to her, your desk job will become a happy dream!â€¶ The administrator said, glaring at the man like a predator.<br><br>Arnold nodded rapidly, then followed the blonde to the office exit.<br><br>â€¶Um,â€¶ the clerk reluctantly turned around, â€¶also, we kinda stole a car on the way here. ICA will help us sort this out, right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?!â€¶ Debrah's eyes widened in shock.<br><br>***<br><br>Leo was enjoying the gentle sunlight in their convertible, her legs on the front panel once again. Arnold would've enjoyed staying here all day, just enjoying her naked body with all the drivers and pedestrians glancing at her with surprise and desire as they passed by. But this girl was here for a reason, and the clerk couldn't let her down. He had to be a man and protect Leo at all costs, at least that's what his hormones kept telling him.<br><br>â€¶Come on, come on,â€¶ the clerk was desperately turning the ignition key.<br><br>Earlier he suggested they change the car, but Leo was sure that an ICA vehicle would be bugged, tracked, and possess a bunch of other qualities that would allow anyone to spy on the duo. On the other hand, an old car belonging to a random junkie was obviously safe.<br><br>â€¶So, is this Vegas far away from here?â€¶<br><br>â€¶If we start driving right now, we'll get there at sunset. T-thanks for choosing me, by the way, and for that scary speech of yours. It, uh, really convinced Debrah,â€¶ the man smiled awkwardly.<br><br>â€¶The speech? I wasn't bluffing, you know. You better be useful, or there will be problems.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh.â€¶<br><br>Finally, the car's engine responded to his attempts, and they could start their long way to Las Vegas. The clerk suggested raising the top, but Leo claimed she liked the wind and didn't see any reason to hide.<br><br>â€¶Indeed, you've got nothing to hide at all,â€¶ Arnold shared a laugh with his naked passenger.<br><br>The two made a couple more cracks at each other, and the atmosphere turned friendly without either of them realizing it. Arnold felt his anxiety subside while driving through his hometown's streets, hearing whistles and honks directed at Leo from all around. After all, even if the situation wasn't what he expected, he was still riding in a red convertible with an amazing naked chick, why not enjoy this moment? Apparently, the car disagreed since it pierced Arnold's ears with a horrible sound, indicating that it was low on fuel.<br><br>â€¶Huh, seems like that junkie forgot to fill his tank. We need to stop at a gas station if we're trying to reach Vegas,â€¶ he concluded, pulling up to a driveway near a shiny sign with the ever-increasing fuel prices.<br><br>There was one small car in line before them, so the wait shouldn't have been long. A suit-clad man was filling up its tank; he looked like a pastor. Leo honked the car's horn to make him go faster, to which he turned around and froze for a moment. This reaction was nothing new, except for the fact that he was clearly not pleased.<br><br>â€¶Atone for your lust, children!â€¶ the pastor said in a disappointed tone, â€¶the pits of hell await those who cling to their vices.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What are you even on about?!â€¶ Leo shouted back, â€¶what vices? I'm not sinning by wearing clothes like most of your women, at least!â€¶<br><br>The pastor was utterly confused by this response and quickly returned to his car. Arnold was glad he didn't continue the argument. This religious clash would mean trouble. He understood Leo's reaction, though. It was expected of Sanflarians who believed in their Many-eyed Star God to not understand some Christian dogmas, especially considering that their deity deemed covering a woman's body to be a sin.<br><br>The duo finally reached the fuel pump, and Arnold urged Leo to leave the car for safety. When she heard that gasoline was highly flammable, she was even more surprised the Earth residents were using it at all. The clerk tried his best to explain that not every planet was blessed with solar energy capable of meeting all of its civilization's needs. As the two got up, a naughty thought crossed Arnold's mind: he really wanted to see Leo's butt up close once more, but he couldn't just ask for it right away, so instead decided to disguise his desire.<br><br>â€¶Do you want to help me fill up the tank? You seem to have strong hands!â€¶<br><br>Leo smirked at the compliment and approached the clerk. It was hard for her to get the hang of it, but soon she grabbed the fuel nozzle along with Arnold and put it right into the tank. The clerk gasped when her tender hand touched his and nearly dropped the nozzle from excitement.<br><br>â€¶Oh, I see why you need my help. Your grip needs some serious training,â€¶ the blonde shook her head.<br><br>The two stood right beside one another, Arnold enjoying the view on Leo's naked butt as she leaned forward to better see the fueling process. A couple cars appeared in line behind them, but their male drivers surely didn't mind the countess taking her time. However, all joyful moments must end, and Arnold soon realized it was time to go and pay. As he was telling this to Leo, she suddenly went into a coughing fit. The reason turned out to be a muscular biker redhead who stood nearby, leaning on her motorcycle. Or, to be more precise, the reason was her cigarette.<br><br>â€¶What are those devilish fumes? Is the car smoke not enough for all of you?!â€¶ Leo covered her nose.<br><br>â€¶You don't smoke in your world?â€¶<br><br>â€¶We do, but not this... Substance. The stench is unlike anything I've smelled before!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, um, I'll explain this later. Just p-please, wait for me and don't do anything too reckless about it. I'll come back in a minute!â€¶<br><br>Arnold ran to the counter, leaving Leo one-on-one with the smoking tomboy. Of course, it only took a couple seconds for the countess to approach her and start the argument. While the clerk was chatting with the cashier, he heard rising female voices coming from outside. The short-haired redhead spread her arms around and spoke in a mocking tone, while Leo showered her with active gestures, once again not noticing the jiggling of her breasts.<br><br>Apparently, the countess tried to explain that she won't stand for poisoning others with this smoke in a public place, while the biker called her a hypocrite for preaching public decency while walking around butt-ass-naked. Soon, Leo had enough and simply snatched the cig from the redhead's hands, throwing it right into the nearby bin. The clerk managed to overhear the last two phrases before their confrontation turned physical.<br><br>â€¶I've got many more, try frisking me if you're bold enough!â€¶ the biker showed Leo her large fist.<br><br>â€¶Gladly,â€¶ a mischevious spark shone in Leo's eyes as she lunged forward.<br><br>Arnold couldn't leave as his card was still getting processed, plus he didn't feel like breaking up another fight, still feeling the bruises from the previous one. So he watched Leo masterfully dodge the biker's blow, then got around her and put her jacket on her head in a swift maneuver. The redhead tried fighting back, but the countess danced around her, setting her sights on the girl's clothes. In a moment, a loud sound was heard through the station when the biker's shirt got ripped to shreds. Her bra followed shortly after, its lock destroyed by Leo's precise strike.<br><br>â€¶What the hell are you doing?!â€¶ the biker tore off her jacket and covered her large, round breasts while the male drivers honked their car horns in appreciation.<br><br>â€¶Frisking you, just as I was asked!â€¶<br><br>Leo ducked as if making a bow and evaded yet another punch, but not only that. She also pulled down the biker's black leather pants, leaving her only in goofy-looking granny panties. Now the redhead's fit, muscular body was almost fully on display, her impressive physique starkly contrasting with her face that was burning from shame. The passersby laughed, probably mistaking this for a show or a desperate ad campaign, and the redhead finally realized there was no winning this battle.<br><br>â€¶Please, stop, I surrended!â€¶ she ran to her bike but suddenly stopped, feeling the pulling sensation on her backside.<br><br>Leo firmly grabbed the redhead's panties and, before their owner could react, swiftly ripped them off. The waistband burst, hitting the biker's hairy pussy and leaving it completely exposed along with her taut backside. The redhead screamed from both pain and embarrassment while running away as if from a wildfire. She managed to start the bike and leave, but only after the countess gave her a final butt-slap. The motorcycle drove off through the streets with whistles and laughs following its naked, red-faced rider.<br><br>â€¶Leo, what did you do?!â€¶ Arnold ran outside, observing the biker's destroyed clothes.<br><br>â€¶I did these streets two favors: removed a smoker and added a hot naked babe, you can thank me later,â€¶ the countess smiled proudly.<br><br>â€¶B-but I told you not to do anything too reckless!â€¶ he whined, understanding how many troubles this assault could cause.<br><br>â€¶True, and I didn't. She left completely unscathed, minus the waistband part of course, but that's her fault for wearing panties. That was just a little lesson for her.â€¶<br><br>The countess grabbed a cigarette pack poking out of the leather pants' pocket and threw it into the bin, completing her altruistic act.<br><br>â€¶Okay, okay, I guess I needed to clarify what my phrase meant by my standards,â€¶ the clerk sighed, then got into the car and hurried to drive off before somebody called the cops.<br><br>They caught a glimpse of the biker's naked ass as she speeded away, trying her best to cover up while driving. One part of the clerk's mind was filled with anxious thoughts: it was a lawsuit AND a traffic accident ready to happen. The other part, the same that prompted him to team up with Sungoods, couldn't help but enjoy what he saw. Still, it was probably best to try controlling Leo more from now on. They overcame less than a quarter of their road to Vegas, and there was no telling what other ideas the naked countess would come up with to spread Sanflarian culture on the way." },
      { title: "Chapter 5", summary: "To Vegas", content: "The red car quickly moved through the streets, gusts of wind blowing on its passengers' faces while the sun caressed their skin. At least now Arnold could relax a bit, letting his reflexes control the car while he made small talk with his majestic companion. He still had to keep his eyes from shifting focus to Leo's nudity, but his fear of crashing the car was greater than his lust, so for now it was alright. The countess herself also took an opportunity to rest from her agitation, raising her hands up high to breathe in the cool wind. When they turned toward the sun and headed out of town, Arnold offered her sunglasses, but she declined.<br><br>â€¶I prefer enjoying the sun fully. Even if it's not Sanflarian, the Many-eyed God still looks upon me as we speak,â€¶ the blonde said, closing her eyes and letting the sunlight envelop her whole.<br><br>She must've done this often, judging by her clean, pretty tan. Arnold made an awkward joke about religion, then felt his lack of social skills showing and decided to turn on the radio. The local news reported about a recent sandstorm, a PR disaster involving a senator, and then mentioned a blonde streaker riding around the town in a red convertible.<br><br>â€¶What's a streaker?â€¶ Leo asked in confusion.<br><br>â€¶Uh, not sure, some radio slang, I suppose,â€¶ Arnold took the safe route, not sure if explaining this would satisfy or anger the countess.<br><br>The news got replaced by music, and while Leo was skeptical at first, the American hits soon caught her attention and even made her move her head in rhythm. On this funky note, the duo rode into the desert, watching as fewer and fewer town buildings flew by. Arnold even allowed himself to add some speed, enjoying how Leo's tits jumped up and down due to the car's poor suspension.<br><br>â€¶Ha, is that fast for you? Milran is waiting! How about you show me real speed, Earth boy?!â€¶ the countess glanced at him with a challenge.<br><br>Usually, the clerk would've quietly declined, but right now, as he was driving with a gorgeous blonde beside him, he felt in control for a moment and didn't want this feeling to slip away. That's what driving a hot date home must've felt like for those bullies in high school! So he accelerated even more, then barely retained control over the car as it moved off the road into the sand for a second.<br><br>A stressful moment, but it was fine... until the duo heard a loud popping sound and felt the convertible moving slower, as if it just got into mud. The clerk pressed the brakes and walked out of the vehicle when it stopped, trying to figure out the problem. Unfortunately, the worst assumption turned out to be true: one of the front tires got punctured and already began deflating.<br><br>â€¶If all of your inventions are so feeble, I won't have problems freeing Milran,â€¶ Leo shook her head as she sat on the seats' backs to see more clearly.<br><br>â€¶Well, at least we didn't lose an entire wheel, positive thinking, he-he,â€¶ Arnold tried reassuring his companion or, rather, himself.<br><br>The countess ignored his words and looked around to find anything that could help. Then a smile appeared on Leo's face, and she pointed at a distant sign.<br><br>â€¶Look, there is a car on it. Just what we need, right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, not exactly. It's a car dealership, not a service... But they should have a spare tire or two.â€¶<br><br>The blonde nodded, then jumped out of the car and bolted right to the sign. Arnold could barely keep up with her phase. Sweat engulfed his entire body in seconds as he stepped on the hot, very hot asphalt under the Nevada sun. Leo's nakedness even made the clerk a bit jealous, though he'd never dare to walk on the road barefoot like she fearlessly did right now. Soon, a large, filled parking lot surrounded by several old-looking buildings came into view, but there were no people around. The business didn't seem to be booming.<br><br>The blonde reached it first but waited at a barrier, wondering whether it meant that the place was closed. Arnold jumped on the opportunity to help and explained that it was only for cars, so they entered and began looking for the owner. Instead, they found rows and rows of used cars, standing here quietly like on a graveyard.<br><br>â€¶Well, I'll give you that, you do have design variety,â€¶ Leo looked over the old vehicles, admitting she was a little impressed.<br><br>â€¶Oh, customers! Good day, hello!â€¶ A voice rang out from behind the cars.<br><br>The duo turned out to see a middle-aged, chubby man with eager sparks in his eyes. He was unshaved and wore a wrinkled jacket, clearly not expecting anyone. His eyes widened as his gaze landed on Leo, who stood with her hand on her hip like a model posing for an erotic photo. This only made the man more excited, and he ran up to the duo, offering deals before they could even say a word.<br><br>â€¶I'm honest Peter, from honest Peter's vehicles! Great to see you here!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Apologies, there might be a misunderstanding. We're just here because we need help,â€¶ Arnold shook his head, cautious about the salesman's enthusiasm.<br><br>â€¶Of course, that's what I'm here for. You're young, successful,â€¶ he threw an awkward glance at Leo's boobs, â€¶you're naked... You want a car with a radio, right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Actually, we already have a car. I took care of it myself,â€¶ the blonde smirked, â€¶we're just missing a tire, that's all.â€¶<br><br>Honest Peter's enthusiasm instantly went out as he realized that this CMNF couple wasn't looking for a deal. The man began talking about the tires being expensive and him not wanting to dismantle the cars, finding a way out of helping the two.<br><br>â€¶Don't you have a stack of spare tires right there?â€¶ Leo pointed in the distance.<br><br>â€¶That's, uh, the tire tower for decoration! You can't have them, sorry.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'm honest Peter, from honest Peter's vehicles! Great to see you here!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Apologies, there might be a misunderstanding. We're just here because we need help,â€¶ Arnold shook his head, cautious about the salesman's enthusiasm.<br><br>â€¶Of course, that's what I'm here for. You're young, successful,â€¶ he threw a shameless glance at Leo's boobs, â€¶you're naked... You need a car with air conditioning!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Actually, we already have a car. I took care of it myself,â€¶ the blonde smirked, â€¶we're just missing a tire, that's all.â€¶<br><br>Honest Peter's enthusiasm instantly went out as he realized that this CMNF couple wasn't looking for a deal. The man began talking about the tires being expensive and him not wanting to dismantle the cars, finding a way out of helping the two.<br><br>â€¶Don't you have a stack of spare tires right there?â€¶ Leo pointed in the distance.<br><br>â€¶That's, uh, the tire tower for decoration! You can't have them, sorry.â€¶<br><br>Arnold sighed, realizing Peter actually expected them to buy an entire car along with a tire. Meanwhile, Leo grew impatient and finally stepped in between the men, demanding the salesman help her get to Vegas in the name of Sanflaria.<br><br>â€¶L-listen, no disrespect to your exhibitionism. I don't want any trouble,â€¶ he was taken aback a little, â€¶but the business is slow and desperate times call for desperate measures.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Aren't you in a good spot for business?â€¶ Arnold looked around.<br><br>â€¶I thought so too. But it turned out that nobody needs a car dealership near Vegas. See, people who go into the strip usually have better cars already, and those who come back through this town often have spent their money on gambling. I need a new way to attract attention to the dealership and make people turn their heads when they see my advertisement.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I don't see how this is our problem,â€¶ Leo showily leaned against one of the cars, making her seem like a pin-up girl.<br><br>Suddenly, something clicked in the heads of both men, and they looked at each other with understanding.<br><br>â€¶S-say, Leo, you're fine with showing off your body, right?â€¶ Arnold asked, even though the answer was obvious, â€¶would you mind posing for a bit if that meant getting the tire?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Posing for what?â€¶ Leo looked at Peter with clear interest in this deal.<br><br>â€¶For an ad campaign!â€¶ The salesman replied and hurried to get his camera.<br><br>In a minute, Leo was already standing near the hood of a vintage sports car, bending backward to show off her majestic breasts while her butt touched the metal. Following Peter's directions, she longinly stared into the camera like a prize waiting to be claimed by the car's lucky future customer. Then the blonde turned around, landing her hands on the hood, and gracefully moved forward with catlike agility. Peter kept taking pictures while Leo got on top of the hood, assuming different poses that highlighted all parts of her amazing, naked figure.<br><br>It was like a game, with the blonde trying to vow the lusting men more and more with her shameless display. When she got on all fours, Arnold couldn't contain himself and pulled out his phone, taking some photos as well. Leo didn't mind that at all. To the contrary, she seemed flattered. This wasn't surprising: women generally loved being admired, it was a part of their nature, and what's a better way for a girl to get admiration than to be completely naked?<br><br>â€¶It's just, uh, for documentation,â€¶ Arnold giggled as he made a close-up of Leo's ass.<br><br>â€¶Sure,â€¶ the blonde playfully wiggled her butt, â€¶document all you want!â€¶<br><br>With these words, Leo sat on the car's hood and spread her legs as far as she could, proudly showcasing her tight, hairless vulva. Peter was barely holding his camera, his hands shaking from the excitement. The clicking sounds filled the dealership as both photographers and their model gradually dropped their inhibitions.<br><br>Leo ended up posing around different cars, complimenting them with her nudity. She crawled in a pickup truck bed, showed off her boobs over a convertible's windshield, and sat in passenger seats as if inviting someone to come and drive her into the sunset. The advertisement already seemed to work: a couple of guys stopped in their tracks when they saw the photoshoot and entered the dealership just to see Leo better. One of Peter's colleagues came out to help them pick a car, but they were too busy staring, so he joined them along with several other pedestrians who happened to pass by.<br><br>By the end, a small crowd formed near Leo, everyone enjoying this bold promotion. The blonde finished it with a bang, too: when she got down from the last car, she did a stunning cartwheel and grabbed one of the tires from the tower right after, pridefully showing Peter her tongue.<br><br>â€¶Hey, but decorations...â€¶ Peter protested a bit.<br><br>â€¶Decorate with those!â€¶ Leo jiggled her breasts with a grin and passed the tire to Arnold, ready to continue their journey.<br><br>The owner thanked the two for their cooperation (especially Leo, of course) and wished them both good luck, promising that he'll vote only for pro-Sanflaria politicians from now on.<br><br>â€¶That was a nice retreat,â€¶ Arnold said while the duo changed the tire.<br><br>â€¶Took us long enough! But it didn't hurt, I suppose. You poor Earth males deserve to witness some unhidden female beauty for a change.â€¶<br><br>The clerk couldn't agree more, but Leo's generocity also had its drawbacks: despite quickly getting into the car, he needed a few minutes to calm down before he could drive. When he came to his senses, the duo continued their journey through the desert with radio and the wind keeping them company.<br><br>The ride went smoothly, with the car gradually leaving more and more miles behind. The next problem Arnold and Leo faced was not as urgent and far more expected: hunger and thirst. Both of them didn't have anything after the motel breakfast, and it was already afternoon.<br><br>â€¶I see a rest stop right there,â€¶ Arnold said, pointing to his right, â€¶or... Maybe you don't wanna waste time?â€¶<br><br>â€¶We need to reach Milran posthaste, but I suppose our stomachs can be a distraction if we don't fill them up. Let's go.â€¶<br><br>The clerk turned the wheel, an anxious yet naughty smile appeared on his lips. He imagined even more locals reacting to Leo's naked body and her shamelessly showing herself off, especially after that warm-up at Peter's. Soon, this idea turned into reality as they slowly drove beside a line of trucks and RVs, their owners turning their heads and catcalling the stunning blonde. The countess herself observed her surroundings with interest, slowly realizing how many different designs the Earthians have come up with and how varied everything around her was. This seemed to intrigue her, although she still didn't trust the locals and pushed this feeling away.<br><br>Leo left the car before Arnold and walked right on the gravel, declining a nearby beefcake's suggestion to carry her. The nearby women laughed, probably expecting her to ouch from pain and come back, but instead Leo calmly moved forward, avoiding larger stones and enjoying the massage from the smaller ones. Meanwhile, the clerk was so invested in his companion's public exposure that he nearly forgot that he'd been here once. The pizzeria with its large sign reading â€¶Tomato Themeâ€¶ reminded him of a family trip. Clearly, this time was more stressful but also much more fun.<br><br>They entered the Tomato Theme arm in arm, attracting a dozen stares right away. The place was actually quite nice with its pastel colors and silly tomato-themed dÃ©cor on the walls. It was also surprisingly busy, probably thanks to those tourist buses left outside. A couple of whistles echoed through the dining area and some folks pulled out their phones.<br><br>Leo must've felt like a star already, since she simply adjusted her hair and walked to the counter, suggestively wiggling her bare hips. The shiny menu board attracted Leo's attention while everyone else in the line lost interest in food and began staring at her sexy body instead. Arnold, all rosy and giggly, kept explaining to the people that his friend was a nudist activist and simply preferred to walk around this way. Technically, nothing of this was untrue.<br><br>â€¶Well, at least she's dressed according to the weather!â€¶ An old guy chuckled, wiping sweat off his forehead.<br><br>â€¶Too bad some of us still have dignity to do that,â€¶ a girl replied sarcastically.<br><br>Arnold twitched. That critic was lucky Leo was too occupied discussing what she wanted to eat, otherwise, she would've probably ended up naked too. Finally, among the surrounding laughs and catcalls, the duo decided on a pizza, and Leo made her order. Unfortunately, the young adult standing on the other side didn't catch her, as he was too busy averting his eyes.<br><br>â€¶What are you doing, huh?â€¶ The blonde raised her voice, â€¶do you think my body is too ugly to look at?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'm sorry, ma'am, but I was raised in a Christian family that prohibits... such things,â€¶ he mumbled to himself.<br><br>â€¶Well, and I was raised in a family that respects others by not ignoring them. You'd better learn this as well,â€¶ Leo scoffed, leaning on the counter.<br><br>â€¶Come on, man, it's nothing bad. You'll offend her if you don't look,â€¶ Arnold whispered, not fully believing that he was actually serious.<br><br>Leo puffed off her impressive chest and landed her hands on her hips, as if provoking the poor clerk with her shameless attitude. The man couldn't handle it and ran away. Instead, the pizzeria's manager came in, his eyes widening from this impressive view. However, his reaction wasn't similar to Peter's, and he sternly demanded Leo leave the pizzeria at once.<br><br>â€¶What example are you setting to other women with this behavior?!â€¶ he argued.<br><br>â€¶The kind that'll let them live in harmony with nature,â€¶ Leo parried with dominance.<br><br>Arnold glanced around the room as the two fought, their arguments getting them nowhere. The crowd behind them started to get agitated; only one female group of Hispanic students seemed to observe Leo with great interest, not even mad about not getting food. Clerk tried objecting to Mark's (according to his name tag) arguments about public indecency, as there were no direct laws against being naked in Nevada. Yet, this fact didn't affect the manager's eagerness to kick the duo out of the restaurant. Finally, Arnold mustered up the courage and led Mark to the side.<br><br>â€¶L-listen, friend, I'm from ICA,â€¶ he showed his credentials, â€¶this right here is an important Sanflarian noble. You must've heard about Sanflaria, right? Solar energy, gardens on the roofs, naked chicks, all the good stuff. Do I have to explain further?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes. Especially the part about why you need to bring her into our establishment!â€¶<br><br>Mark didn't back down, but ICA credentials did their part and made him doubtful. Then, the final blow came out of nowhere: one of the Hispanic girls approached Mark from behind and voiced support for Leo. Her assertive pose and natural beauty caught the manager off-guard and made him silent for a moment. The girl, who introduced herself as Ximena, was about twenty years old, with a stylish black care covering the sides of her elegant face.<br><br>She was an owner of a fit, feminine hourglass figure, which was obvious due to her tank top and jeans not covering much of it at all. Especially her breasts with perfectly distinguishable nipples due to an obvious lack of bra, at least C-cup judging by their size. It was also clear the girl was a fan of tattoos. Arnold noticed a snake sliding down her shoulder and a deadly-looking bird on her arm. A pair of fancy earrings were hanging from the girl's ears, and her dark eyes were complemented with bold mascara.<br><br>â€¶As an American, I will not stand for this neglect of human freedoms.â€¶ Ximena exclaimed. â€¶If you kick these two out, me and my friends will also leave. And those three large pizzas we were about to get... you'll have to kiss our order goodbye.â€¶<br><br>The manager looked back at Arnold, fuming with rage. There was an anxious pause, during which the clerk thought Mark was about to just throw all of them out in an instant. Yet he let out a deep sigh and allowed Leo to stay, adding that the place didn't pay him well enough to deal with this bullshit.<br><br>â€¶W-wow, thanks a lot. It could've been trouble,â€¶ Arnold smiled at Ximena.<br><br>â€¶No problem, I'm a big fan of Sanflarian culture, and seeing one of their girls here is something I'd never expect. Would love to talk once we make our orders, so don't sit too far away. Also, your girlfriend is a hottie!â€¶<br><br>When the clerk came back to the counter, Leo was already demanding pizza and enjoying the embarrassment of the poor cashiers, who had to politely stare at her naked body while taking the order. Soon, their pepperoni pizza was ready, and the duo got a table across the room from Ximena's group.<br><br>The casual atmosphere must've prevailed over Eleonora's nobility for a moment, as her table manners quickly disappeared. The countess sat with one of her feet on the chair, boldly showing off her tits and vulva to dozens of people in the dining area. Then, she grabbed the biggest slice with both her hands and bit into it like a savage beast.<br><br>â€¶Wow,â€¶ the blonde exclaimed in awe, â€¶this does not feel healthy, but I feel like it's a worthy sacrifice for this taste!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, trust me, you haven't seen anything yet,â€¶ Arnold giggled at Leo's enthusiasm, still a bit anxious due to Mark and all the spectators.<br><br>After a bit of small talk, the clerk turned around to see Ximena waving at him. He waved back, after which the short-haired girl went to the bathroom with an odd wink. It was hard to make out the meaning of this gesture, and the situation only became stranger when one of the girl's friends went in and came back, holding something. It took the clerk a minute to realize that â€¶somethingâ€¶ was Ximena's clothes! Before he could react, the same friend ran up to Leo and whispered something in her ear.<br><br>â€¶Huh, intriguing indeed!â€¶ she smiled from ear to ear, â€¶alright, I'll pay her a visit.â€¶<br><br>With these words, the blonde got up from her seat and strolled to the bathroom, leaving Arnold completely confused. The two girls stayed inside for several minutes, and when another young tourist walked in, she quickly left with her cheeks all rosy. Then, Leo came out of the bathroom, practically jumping into the dining area, full of enthusiasm and satisfaction. Arnold saw her smiles already, but this one seemed the most sincere one so far.<br><br>Then, the blonde playfully pointed at the door as if presenting a performer, and a moment later it opened again. Out came Ximena, and the pizzeria filled with gasps and whistles again. Mainly because the student, who looked even better now, was completely naked from head to toe, with only her earrings, make-up, and about a dozen tattoos covering her shapely body.<br><br>Two naked girls waved to their audience and walked to Arnold's table, holding hands and winking at each other. The clerk dropped his pizza slice back to the table, hypnotized by two pairs of breasts jiggling as if in a rhythm. When Ximena sat beside the two, he could only nod with a goofy smile.<br><br>â€¶Sorry for taking up several minutes of your time,â€¶ the student said while eyeing the pizza. â€¶I just had to prepare so we all could be comfortable. So, wanna tell me about Sanflaria?â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 6", summary: "Pizza with Bullets", content: "â€¶Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. ICA operative? I've got no hidden weapons, you can see that!â€¶ Ximena giggled while Arnold ogled her fit figure.<br><br>The clerk turned his attention to pizza, much to the delight of the two naked girls who cheerfully poked fun at his shyness. He turned out to be completely unprepared for Ximena just stripping like that. Of course, seeing Leo's naked form throughout the last day made Arnold a bit more confident around her, but she was a Sanflarian. This girl was a regular US citizen who just decided to join Leo's naked show on a whim. Arnold found this unexpected, surprising, and simply amazing at the same time. The countess reacted positively as well, looking at Ximena with a newfound respect.<br><br>â€¶Finally, someone who understands,â€¶ the blonde grinned, running her finger down the student's body.<br><br>â€¶Like I said, I adore Sanflarian culture and traditions, and it's amazing that I met you here. I won't let this chance go to waste, so take this as me showing my love for your world!â€¶ Ximena pointed at her alluring boobs and wiggled them a little, to which the blonde smiled and did the same in solidarity.<br><br>Arnold commended Ximena's bravery, though he could clearly tell Leo's comfort wasn't the only reason she stripped. The Hispanic girl's nipples were erect, and there was a naughty smile on her scarlet lips. She must've enjoyed this far more than it seemed, and not just because of the interworld contact.<br><br>It became even more apparent when Ximena strolled back to her friends through the dining area to grab some pizza. The girl's smile seemed to grow while she walked past each table. One of her buddies gave her a loud buttslap and told her to â€¶have funâ€¶ before she went back, to which others reacted with a laugh.<br><br>â€¶Now there's enough food for all of us,â€¶ Ximena said, spreading the slices she brought between the trio. â€¶So, what is the countess' business in our little state?â€¶<br><br>Arnold imitated a cough, trying his best to signal Leo that she shouldn't tell too much. The countess gave him a discreet wink, still not trusting the locals.<br><br>â€¶I suppose you can call it sight-seeing.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I see, you don't have to explain if it's a secret,â€¶ the smart girl giggled. â€¶Are you impressed with our sights so far? How do our lands hold compared to your own province?â€¶<br><br>Leo told the truth about her initial impression about the diner and the hotel. Ximena glanced at Arnold with a bit of judgment, as if it were his fault they couldn't find a better place to stay at night. Then, however, the blonde added that she enjoyed some of the Earth's inventions, the food was slowly growing on her, and the sun here was quite pleasant, even if it couldn't be compared to the solar star of her homeland. Of course, Ximena used that last remark to jump topics, clearly more interested in Sanflaria than this place.<br><br>Their conversation began flowing like a river, nice and refreshing. Leo told her naked friend about the mighty trees whose leaves were all colors of the rainbow and unique animals that seemed magical to Earthians who visited them. Then, there was a story about Sanflarian cities that beamed with solar light that moved their progress forward. She didn't forget about the spiritual life of her people, consisting of profound fields such as arts and religion, both of which were mostly dominated by women.<br><br>It turned out, Leo was a painter herself and enjoyed capturing the nature and the life of her beloved Kir'ador. Arnold felt a bit guilty after learning this fact. He was so focused on the countess' nudity that he forgot to ask about her other interests. Meanwhile, the countess bonded with Ximena over their shared passion for art. Especially tattoos, to see which Leo made her new friend stand up and turn around like she was a model on a catwalk, much to the delight of Arnold and other male customers.  <br><br>â€¶I see you've made yourself a work of art. More than your body already was, I mean,â€¶ Leo concluded with a smile.<br><br>â€¶Indeed. I'd love to see something like this on you too, but I take it you'd prefer not to?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I prefer my natural look, gifted to me by nature, indeed. But there is one tattoo I made, even though it's a bit hidden.â€¶<br><br>All the nearby patrons looked over the countess' naked body, trying to spot an image they somehow missed before. After a minute of intrigue, Leo turned her back to her friends and raised her golden mane. On the back of her neck was a coat of arms, resembling an orange and yellow shield with white wings and a massive tree growing in its center. An everlasting symbol of Kir'ador that Leo carried to always remember who her kin were. Yet she chose the only part of her body everyone won't see right away so she wouldn't flaunt her noble upgringing in front of the commoners.<br><br>â€¶It's amazing,â€¶ Arnold complemented the symbol while Ximena applauded its deep meaning.<br><br>â€¶Thanks, but it's nothing special,â€¶ Leo became shy for the first time since Arnold knew her, â€¶just an inner part of me I wanted to represent.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I have a toast. For self-expression!â€¶ The dark-skinned girl cheerfully raised her lemonade.<br><br>The duo replied in kind, their interaction naturally turning silly as they grew comfortable with each other. Ximena wanted Leo to try more pizza types, so the nudies ended up feeding one another, laughing at how far the cheese stretched and gently putting pepperoni slices into each other's mouths. It was funny when one of the slices fell onto Leo's nipple, and Ximena noticed it first, saying:<br><br>â€¶Oh no, censorship!â€¶ then suddenly leaned forward and ate it right from Leo's boob.<br><br>â€¶Good thinking,â€¶ Leo laughed in response, â€¶although you still have a lot to learn. Firstly, puff out your chest a bit and spread your legs. We don't wanna make it seem like you're shy, right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Of course not, my lady,â€¶ Ximena did what she was told, biting her lip in pleasure.<br><br>The next target were mozzarella sticks, with both girls grabbing one at the same time. Leo didn't lose her cool and offered a very creative way of eating it: she held one half of the stick with her mouth and neared Ximena with a tempting gaze. The student took the offer, and the two quickly finished the stick as their lips touched in the middle, turning this into a lovely kiss. Leo's approval for her new friend's choice to strip naked was obvious.<br><br>â€¶Like in Lady and the Tramp,â€¶ Arnold giggled.<br><br>â€¶Thanks for calling me a tramp, I guess,â€¶ Ximena couldn't contain a laugh either.<br><br>On the other hand, Leo noticed Arnold's longing gaze and decided not to leave him behind. In a moment, another mozzarella stick appeared in her mouth as she leaned toward the clerk with an alluring look on her face. The lust and heat of the moment almost made Arnold partake, but at the very last moment he noticed many patrons looking right at them and let his anxiety win this time.<br><br>â€¶T-thanks, I'll stick with the pizza,â€¶ he said, hating his own indecisiveness.<br><br>â€¶Your loss!â€¶ Leo raised her head and swalloped the stick whole, letting it land in her mouth like a circus animal catching a treat.<br><br>While Arnold felt like he spoiled the fun for himself a little, watching the two was still quite fun. Especially after milkshakes appeared on their table, both girls drank them quite provocatively, not even thinking about their public image. They thoroughly enjoyed the flavor while sucking on their straws and licking off whipped cream.<br><br>The cream helped by dripping down on their hands since there was so much of it, far more than in a usual serving. As if the staff knew this would happen. When Ximena accidentally spilled some on her impressive tits, Arnold realized he could barely contain himself and began looking all over the restaurant to distract himself and keep at least some rational thinking intact. Then he noticed something odd.<br><br>There was a man outside, clad in a suit that seemed out of place around here. He was walking back and forth near the window, holding something under his jacket. The countess noticed Arnold's concern just in the right moment to turn her head as well.<br><br>She probably didn't know that the object the man just pulled out from his jacket was a submachine gun, but was smart enough to realize it was a weapon. In the next second, Leo jumped on an unsuspecting Ximena and knocked her to the ground. Some patrons rolled their eyes, thinking that the naked duo's flirt just went a bit too far.<br><br>â€¶Wow, my lady, are you sure we aren't moving too fast?â€¶ The student blushed as their naked bodies touched, causing the girls' nipples and pussies to rub against each other.<br><br>â€¶Everyone, get down!!!â€¶ Arnold screamed in a fit of adrenaline, jumping down from his seat.<br><br>In the very second, a rain of bullets sprayed through the Tomato Theme's windows, shattering them with a deafening sound. The pizzeria filled with panicked screams as the patrons fell to the floor in terror while the shots rang out like rolls of thunder. Arnold looked up for a second, but it was enough to see confusion on the man's large, hairless face. He did not expect to miss and now had to hurry with a new plan before he was stopped.<br><br>â€¶H-hello, Debrah! Yeah, no time for formalities. We're getting shot at!â€¶ The clerk screamed into his phone, crawling farther from the windows.<br><br>â€¶Damnit, I knew your people cannot be trusted!â€¶ Leo scoffed in the background, turning her attention to the shooter.<br><br>Debrah's voice barely came through the surrounding chaos, but the clerk heard her saying that the help was nearby.<br><br>â€¶ICA operatives were closely following you this whole time,â€¶ the administrator explained, â€¶just not close enough for our nudist to get nervous. You didn't actually think we'd leave you the only person on the job, did you?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I mean... Hey, w-what does that mean?!â€¶ Arnold whined, but then heard another spray of bullets echoing through the hall and fell silent.<br><br>â€¶Just keep her safe until our guys arrive. They'll make short work of that psycho.â€¶<br><br>He was about to say that he's got this, but then turned around and saw that Leo was gone from her hiding spot. Panic struck Arnold's brain like a needle, his eyes began darting from side to side while scary thoughts rushed in his head. He looked under the tables with trembling people, at the counter with destroyed cash registers, and beside the advertisement posters with pizzas now filled with so many holes you'd think the cheese on them was Swiss. Finally, a familiar naked figure came into view, squatting right beside a window like a spy on a mission.<br><br>The shooter looked around and stepped closer to the shattered window, looking for the naked girl. Arnold managed to catch Leo's attention with his active gestures, in which he begged for her to crawl back to him and forget about any dangerous ideas. Instead, she shushed him and hit her palm with her fist, making her intentions very clear.<br><br>Leo suddenly got up while the shooter was reloading and did a quick somersault back outside, not even scared of the glass all around her. Ximena looked at the countess with pure adoration while Arnold prayed to both worlds' gods for her survival. <br><br>â€¶Looking for me?â€¶ Leo got up, looking like a model for a food play fetish video.<br><br>Her body was covered with a spilled milkshake and sauce from a pizza that fell on top of her earlier, along with dust from the road and many little scratches she got from the glass. The suit-clad man was so surprised he didn't recognize her. Leo got to attack first, hitting his arm with a sharp piece of glass she found on the floor. The guy panicked and hit her with his weapon, causing Leo to grunt in pain even though she managed to block it in time. <br><br>Seeing partial success, the guy decided to continue and lunged at Leo like a rabid dog, showering her with hits and kicks. He missed most of the time, but still landed sometimes. The countess took one hit, then another, then an opportunity presented itself, and she jumped to the left, stabbing the man in his side. A scream pierced the patrons' ears as the shooter felt the pain, but Leo didn't wait for him to finish. She knocked the submachine gun from his hands with a precise kick, showing off her beautiful front to all the patrons in the process.<br><br>The shooter tried to fight back but missed again, slowed down by the shard sticking out of his side. Seeing his pain, Leo decided to add a bit more and grabbed another piece of glass with her foot, expertly holding it between her toes. Before anyone could grasp the danger and the beauty of this move, the blonde did a spin and drove the glass right into the man's leg, causing him to stagger. As he began falling, Leo finished her work with a knee right to his ugly, bald face, kicking out several teeth in the process. And just like that, she stood above him, dirty and bruised from his strikes, yet proud of her victory and her naked combat skills. <br><br>â€¶So that's what it's like seeing Sanflarians in action,â€¶ Arnold mumbled to himself, unable to look away just like everyone else around him.<br><br>Suddenly, a car stopped nearby, and several armed men in black armor ran out of it with their rifles ready for combat. One of them began shouting commands and saying something about finding the countess, yet froze as soon as he saw her, standing with her bare leg atop of her groaning assailant.<br><br>â€¶You're ICA? A bit late, I thought you weren't coming and already took matters into my own hands,â€¶ Leo said with her head up high.<br><br>The entire rest stop fell silent for a minute, then the air got filled by Ximena's cheerful applause, to which Arnold and others joined in as well.<br><br>***<br><br>Leo was sitting on a table in a now-empty dining area while the tourists and pretty much everybody else rushed to their cars, finally able to escape the crime scene. An ICA medic circled around the girl with her tools, disinfecting her scratches and making sure there were no more serious wounds. Outside, a tandem of an ambulance and a police car began booking the shooter, whose only reaction was whining and groaning in pain.<br><br>â€¶Ugh, I already told you that I'm fine,â€¶ Leo pushed the medic away. â€¶It'd be better if you checked on that poor foe of mine. His injuries are much greater, I made sure of that!â€¶<br><br>â€¶We understand,â€¶ the broad-shouldered ICA commander clad in his combat armor didn't share Leo's enthusiasm one bit, â€¶but him appearing here still means danger, Lady Eleonora. Someone's trying to kill you, and there will be a moment before that freak can give testimony.â€¶<br><br>The blonde rolled her eyes. She already guessed what was coming. And, sure enough, the next thing the commander did was urge her to abandon the mission and return back to Sanflaria until ICA â€¶sort things outâ€¶. For once, Arnold did the same since he suddenly felt the fear of death outweighing even his social anxiety. However, all of their words accomplished nothing, maybe even making Leo more determined.<br><br>â€¶If there's truly danger, I must make sure my cousin is safe as soon as possible!â€¶ The blonde boldly got up from the table and puffed out her chest.<br><br>The soldiers shyly averted their gazes not to stare directly at her alluring boobs, but Leo caught that and smiled. After all, she was still in control, which was useful because apparently, the blonde trusted ICA even less after this incident. When Arnold came back to the table with her, he heard all kinds of theories ranging from the agency having an informant to this being an inside job. No wonder she was against following their instructions.<br><br>â€¶You're practically the only one I can trust,â€¶ Leo sighed while looking sideways at the soldiers.<br><br>Arnold felt his confidence raising for once and grabbed the girl's hand, making sure she didn't doubt him.<br><br>â€¶Don't sweat it. I know you aren't lying. You'd be too afraid to cross me even if you were one of them,â€¶ the blonde added.<br><br>Arnold felt his confidence getting destroyed again, probably shouldn't have rushed with the conclusions.<br><br>â€¶I really should've just forced you two to go away. Good thing that by some miracle nobody got hit,â€¶ the manager said, rushing from table to table and documenting the damages.<br><br>â€¶I... I'm sure ICA will cover that, sir,â€¶ Arnold caught a disapproval look from the commander as soon as he said that.<br><br>Indeed, he wasn't sure. Meanwhile, Leo finished her mozzarella sticks and looked down at her body, shaking her hands from all the dirt she got on herself while fighting. It'd be better to clean her somehow and do so quick because they had to keep moving. There was no telling who else might've followed them to the rest stop. While the clerk was thinking, Ximena hugged Leo's bare chest from behind and whispered grateful words into her ear.<br><br>â€¶Our hero,â€¶ the student giggled, having just came back from her hiding.<br><br>Leo hugged her back, enveloping the girl's head with her strong arms. The two stayed like this for a moment, then Ximena had to remove her hands since they also became dirty with sauce and milkshake.<br><br>â€¶I see you liked food here a bit too much. Don't worry, there's a hose we can use to wash it off. Just don't fall into the dirt again on your way there,â€¶ Ximena jested like an old friend.<br><br>Arnold found these jokes to be a bit in poor taste after what happened, but Leo simply laughed it all off along with her naked buddy. However, right after that she decided to get back at Ximena, which led to a nearby milkshake being spilled right at the student's alluring tits. The dark-skinned girl gasped and instinctively covered her chest for a second. Meanwhile, Leo's hand found some pepperoni lying on the floor and smeared it all over Ximena's belly. She even touched her pussy with that thick, salty liquid, which caused the student to gasp once again.<br><br>â€¶Now we're even! Or you thought you could just sit it out?!â€¶ Leo got up and stood near her friend, both of them covered with filthy, sticky foods.<br><br>â€¶Ow, yuck!â€¶ Ximena shook her hands, trying to remove pieces of pepperoni and whipped cream from her nude figure.<br><br>â€¶Let us find that hose, then,â€¶ the blonde finished by slapping Ximena's butt when the two of them went outside.<br><br>Arnold spent the next five minutes watching the scene that looked like one of his dreams: two beautiful, naked girls watered each other with a hose right in the middle of the road, while more than a dozen tourists and truckers stood around them with laughs, catcalls, and phone cameras. It took Ximena a minute to adjust to the freezing water, but Leo remained fearless and let the Hispanic girl thoroughly hose down her naked figure. Their nipples got hard from the cold, and a cute-looking pink hue appeared throughout their bodies.<br><br>The cleaning went very well since neither of the girls was shy about touches. They were grabbing and gently massaging each other's boobs and backsides, practically groping one another under this cold shower. It didn't last long since the grumpy old owner of the hose got tired of looking at the girls wasting his water. He was truly too old to see it in a more pleasant way, so the naked beauties had to stop with their bodies clean and glistening under the sun.<br><br>â€¶I applaud you, it was a nice idea,â€¶ Leo said, wringing out her mane.<br><br>â€¶Yeah, pretty cool... actually cool,â€¶ Ximena shivered and hurried inside, â€¶okay, where are my clothes?â€¶<br><br>As soon as Leo heard the last word, she jumped right after Ximena and stood behind her with a disapproving look.<br><br>â€¶Clothes? Don't tell me you're planning to get dressed, darling.â€¶<br><br>Ximena turned out with a surprised look while her friends giggled behind her back.<br><br>â€¶B-but, I mean, I can't just leave like...â€¶ the student started, to which Leo just furrowed her brow and leaned closer to her.<br><br>â€¶Yeah,â€¶ one of Ximena's friends said, â€¶you started this. Now you have to go all the way!â€¶<br><br>The others nodded, high-fiving each other and laughing at Ximena's naked ordeal. The moment Ximena turned around, she saw faces all around her, many of them happy to see her nude and clearly disappointed by her idea to get dressed. The girl stood there for a minute, and then her mood suddenly changed. She looked at the countess with aroused eyes, ran her hands down her pretty body, and said in a sweet, sexy tone:<br><br>â€¶Sure, I'm not going to wear them. I was meaning to throw them in the garbage bin instead!â€¶<br><br>Applause and wooing echoed through the pizzeria, Ximena's friends supporting her bold decision.<br><br>â€¶I didn't expect anything less from you!â€¶ Leo's eyes shone with admiration while she gathered Ximena's clothes along with their owner and headed outside to throw them away for good.<br><br>A minute later, the clothing was already lying in the bin, torn up and destroyed by playful girls. Ximena was holding her last garmet, panties with a bursted waistband, and looked at it with an overly dramatic sadness. Eventually, Leo got tired of waiting and snatched the underwear right from Ximena's hands, sending it to the garbade as well.<br><br>Ximena giggled like a naughty schoolgirl, then thanked the countess and gave her a hug. Arnold could tell it was actually worrying for her to give away her clothing like that, but clearly she was also excited, as her nipples got even harder despite her no longer being cold.<br><br>â€¶Thanks for your company,â€¶ Leo said with a grin. â€¶Most girls in your world seem to find stripping naked to be a nightmare. You're the first one bold enough to do it on your own. Be proud!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, I am already,â€¶ Ximena whispered in a sexy voice, â€¶you have to go now, right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Indeed. It was nice meeting you, but we have a mission ahead of us. I cannot keep it waiting.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Alright... I understand. I just hope we'll meet again sometime. Oh, and just so we can remember this day a bit better, wanna do something even nicer?â€¶<br><br>Leo leaned closer to Ximena since she thought the student would whisper something in her ear. Instead, she enveloped her hands around the blonde's body and began kissing her on the lips, getting bolder and bolder with each moment. Leo was surprised at first, but quickly accepted the rules and replied in kind, allowing Ximena to fully realize her passion. In the next second, the two were already making out, their tongues intertwining in a wild dance of sexuality.<br><br>Leo shamelessly grabbed her friend's butt while Ximena landed her hand on the blonde's boob and began massaging it, enjoying the countess' nipples becoming erect under her touch. A couple more woos were heard in the parking lot while the local truckers enjoyed the vibrant show. Leo and Ximena finished their kiss by licking each other's lips and saying their see-you-laters with satisfied looks in their eyes. Ximena concluded by slapping Leo's butt when she went back to her car, teasing what they could do later if given enough time.<br><br>â€¶Bye!â€¶ Leo waved, jumping into the convertible like an agile feline, â€¶and remember that covering up is a sin! In my homeworld, this can get your hands tied behind your back for an entire day, so don't screw up.â€¶<br><br>The clerk couldn't help but throw yet another glance on the blonde's tits once he sat near her, recalling how soft these spheres felt when he slept on them. This bold goodbye kiss was kind of surprising but made sense if you knew Sanflarian culture. While homosexuality was somewhat less accepted in their society compared to the US, there was a paradoxical lack of judgement for such sexy little episodes if they involved women.<br><br>In many provinces, it was considered normal for females to satisfy their sexual needs with one another, and shying away from such displays of compassion was an oddity. Of course, the rules regarding Earthians were more strict in this case, but Eleonora seemed to make an acceptance just this once as to reward Ximena for her respectful nudity.<br><br>Arnold sat on the driver's seat and was about to start the car, but a phone call with Debrah's number made him reconsider. He could feel there was something wrong since his admin would never call just to chat. Something wrong other than the crazy shooter trying to kill the otherworldly naked girl, that is.<br><br>â€¶H-hello,â€¶ he said as he exited the car, making sure Leo didn't hear him.<br><br>â€¶Arnold, we've got problems.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Thanks, I'm aware.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I mean... Shut up and listen,â€¶ Debrah raised her tone, â€¶there is something strange going on. Our guys went to Milran's room to check on him, but he's nowhere to be found. His phone is still not responding, and there is no telling where he could be.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?!â€¶ Arnold's shock was so great it even caused him to forget about his shyness.<br><br>â€¶My question exactly. It seems like Eleonora's suspicions weren't just crazy conspiracies after all.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What are we going to do?!â€¶<br><br>â€¶So far, it's a disaster, but higher-ups think we need to stick with the plan. The worst thing we can do now is to scare the nudie off and make her go investigating on her own. Bring her to Vegas. Our unit will meet you there and come up with some excuse to keep her in place until we sort this out. Be extra careful though. The bosses will assign agents to assist you along the way, but it doesn't mean you can get reckless. We already saw what happened in the pizzeria. Don't waste time either. So far they only sent one guy, maybe they're still counting on him succeeding and won't try again for today. Arnold, I can't believe I'm saying this, but ICA is counting on you. The fate of our relations with Sanflaria now hangs in the balance.â€¶<br><br>The last part probably should've motivated Arnold, but instead it made him gulp again and filled his mind with so many thoughts he could barely finish the conversation. Well, regardless of how he felt about it, there was no choice. It was what he wanted, right? Right? Now came time to deliver. The clerk sat back into the convertible without words, switching topics right away so Leo wouldn't ask about the call.<br><br>â€¶You... You fought really well. Who taught you?â€¶ Arnold asked before she could speak.<br><br>â€¶Thanks,â€¶ a proud smile appeared on Leo's lips, â€¶it's a mixed martial art devised specifically for Sanflarian females. Takes into account our anatomy and the lack of clothing. Teaches us to dodge and make every strike count.â€¶<br><br>â€¶And the training was so good you can now take down armed men? Must've been one hell of a self-defense class.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, I can do much more than that. I'll tell you more while you drive. It seems like there's still many wonderful aspects of Sanflaria you have no idea about!â€¶<br><br>The red car drove through the desert as the sun began to set, its driver trying his best to keep his cool while his knowledge about his dreamed-of world rose along with the stakes." },
      { title: "Chapter 7", summary: "The Naked Battle", content: "Eleonora was born in the heart of Kir'ador, a pearl of western Sanflaria protected by the shell of vibrant forests and vast mountain ranges. Her parents, the province's proud rulers, gave her the best education they could, ensuring that Leo was trained in both body and mind. They never forgot about her spirit as well, teaching the young countess Sanflarian values that she'll have to represent as a ruler in the future. There were some Leo couldn't understand until she got older, some she was still doubtful about but followed out of respect for her family, but among them there was one that she never questioned, and which also stuck out the most: Sanflarian females had to always remain naked.<br><br>Contrary to men who could wear whatever they wanted and hide behind the clothes at any moment, women of Sanflaria lived just like they were born. They had no other choice due to their biology, but most of them didn't feel like they wanted it anyway. Female nudity was a staple in Sanflarian culture, with many considering it a blessing rather than a curse. The Many-Eyed God itself must've considered women so beautiful that it forbade them from ever hiding their bodies, also granting them immunity to the light of its stars that men couldn't achieve no matter how hard they trained.<br><br>Sanflarian women could freely work in the fields under the fiercest sunrays. They painted their god's flaming eye during its most active phases, standing outside with their easels while men hid indoors, afraid of its radiation. Those in the clergy danced under the sunlight, performing their elegant rituals to honor the divine being watching over them through the skies. The men still excelled in many other things, of course, which led to a strict distribution of labor and societal roles. Many Earthians considered this discriminatory, but Sanflarian culture was built on the notion that while males and females were different, unity is what made them strong. <br><br>But nudity wasn't without its drawbacks, and that's what Sanflarian women were taught from the start. Lacking clothes didn't just mean flaunting your beautiful form for everyone to see, it also meant being vulnerable for cold, dirt, and all kinds of bruises. Such things were impossible to avoid, so females simply had to accept them as a part of their lives. They learned to tolerate pain and cold weather, always maintained strict hygiene, and did sports that made their bodies look beautiful and toned. It was a battle they had to fight throughout their lives, but the spoils were always worth it.<br><br>The pinnacle of such training was a martial art with a difficult name, which roughly translated to English as â€¶windstrike.â€¶ This style was designed exclusively for females, taking into account their anatomy and even offering varied moves depending on their breast size. Masters of this style moved nimbly yet confidently, a mixture that would be hard to achieve while wearing clothes. They also focused on dodging, either to fully counter an attack or turn a possible wound into a mere scratch.<br><br>In Kir'ador, Leo was known as a skilled windstriker with many trophies to back this title up. She trained since childhood, as this was the wish of her father. Originally, the count sent her to one of the best masters on the continent because she was too unruly and hyperactive. The ruler hoped that the discipline required to learn the art would calm his daughter down. It didn't, but at least now Eleonora could pull her own weight if she got into trouble.<br><br>There were many competitors from other provinces who could challenge the blonde's style during Sanflarian tournaments. There was Katrina the Red from the south, known for her long braid and strong attacks. Michola, nicknamed the Queen of Frogs due to her swampside residence, was also dangerous, as her speed was far greater than one could expect from her chubby form. But, most of all, Eleonora found herself competing with Viparia of Puranad, often named â€¶Cobraâ€¶ for being able to finish a fight with one blow.<br><br>While the duo rode through the desert, Eleonora described her last encounter with Viparia in great detail. Arnold barely kept himself from salivating when Leo described her opponent's appearance, adding yet another beautiful, naked body to the clerk's imagination. Cobra was a tall, muscular woman with abs and calves that could impress even experienced weightlifters. Viparia's skin was the color of dark chocolate, her lips were always shining with lavender lipgloss, while her long dreadlocks effectively combined black and purple. The main distinctive feature of this girl, outside of her sexy, toned physique, was a giant tattoo of a snake crawling throughout her back and left leg, as if slowly rising from the ground to bite the girl's neck.<br><br>â€¶W-wow, you remember her remarkably well,â€¶ Arnold commented, breathing heavily.<br><br>The image of Leo and Ximena taking a shower and making out in public still dominated his thoughts, and now this? It's like the countess tried to make this already hard task even harder... In more ways than one, that is.<br><br>â€¶Of course, how can I forget? We're even in terms of wins, but the fights are tough. Especially after that one time when she tried to make me concede by sitting on my face,â€¶ Leo scoffed, â€¶but no worries, it was me who got the last laugh at the end... I still remember that muffled voice calling out from under my buttcheeks, ha-ha.â€¶<br><br>Arnold understood that if he'll lose control over himself, he won't be able to steer the wheel either, so he asked Leo to dwell more on the geographical and cultural side of Sanflaria rather than its naked women. He couldn't believe he was doing it either. Well, it turned out that Katrina, Michola, and Cobra were all descendants of lower nobles, and the four of them had a friendly rivarly of sorts.<br><br>One of them would be the other, then a third one would beat the previous winner and claim that she's better than the girl who lost the first fight, challenging her to a duel, and so on. Cobra was of the second highest rank after Eleonora, being a younger sister of the most influential baron in Kir'ador. This granted her the honor of competing with Eleonora like they were cousins, since the two could frequently meet and moved in similar circles. <br><br>â€¶If only other fighters were here with me, we could take on an army of these shooters without even blinking!â€¶ the blonde clenched her fists.<br><br>â€¶You ought to be careful with such claims,â€¶ the clerk shook his head. â€¶Bare flesh is no match for bullets!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Have you missed my previous two battles?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Just don't get too cocky, because the third might not go as good.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Now you sound like my father,â€¶ Leo rolled her eyes like a schoolgirl who didn't do her homework.<br><br>â€¶You don't get along with him?â€¶<br><br>The blonde let out a somewhat condescending chuckle.<br><br>â€¶Of course we do! I was just fooling around. He's a great man who'd do anything for Kir'ador and our noble house. His punishments are sometimes harsh, but always just,â€¶ Leo added after a second of contemplation, â€¶mom helps him, of course, both to work and to relax. She's a wise woman, but can be incredibly silly at times.â€¶<br><br>The clerk noted that Leo must've inherited from her parents even more than she thought, but decided not to bring that up.<br><br>While the two kept up their banter, they lost interest in the lifeless desert that surrounded them and only paid attention to the road. That's why neither of them noticed a sneaky orange SUV driving out from behind a nearby hill and getting on the road right behind them. Arnold accidentally caught a glimpse of it while balancing his gaze between the highway and Leo, who now sat leaning backward with her hands behind her head, exposing her amazing tits as much as she could.<br><br>There was nothing out of the ordinary about the car, so Arnold just got a bit surprised that he didn't notice it earlier and kept driving. However, when he looked at the rearview mirror once again, the SUV was much closer and kept approaching.<br><br>â€¶Damn, this guy is in a hurry,â€¶ the clerk commented and took a bit to the side, letting the SUV through.<br><br>The orange car neared them, catching Leo's attention due to its unusual color. She was about to talk with the driver, who clearly began ogling her naked body, yet before she could do so, something odd happened. Instead of passing the duo by, the SUV suddenly swerved and hit the convertible, nearly sending it to the nearby ditch. Arnold tightly grabbed the wheel with a gasp, while Leo yelled something in Sanflarian with such rage that it was clearly not meant to be pleasant. The SUV driver didn't even flinched and instead continued to move his car sideways, trying to get the red car out of the highway.<br><br>â€¶What the hell are you doing?!â€¶ Leo yelled after the door near her was hit.<br><br>â€¶S-stop!â€¶ Arnold begged, trying his best to control the vehicle.<br><br>â€¶Sorry folks, just business,â€¶ the man shouted with a wide grin, continuing to hit the convertible.<br><br>â€¶Damnit, they're still onto us!â€¶ Arnold pressed down the gas pedal with panic, hoping to outrun the SUV before it was too late.<br><br>But the car was already too close and blocked them from freely continuing their route, using its large size and sturdier structure to its advantage.<br><br>â€¶Leave your attempts to kill us this instant, or you'll pay dearly!â€¶ the blonde said with pressure and suddenly got up from her seat, boldly staring at the criminals' faces while displaying the entirety of her gorgeous, naked form.<br><br>â€¶Wow, what a chick! Too bad your mangled corpse won't be so good-looking,â€¶ one of the bandits said, interrupted by the roaring engine of their SUV.<br><br>Arnold realized they had to think on their feet and began anxiously sorting through various ideas. They could've tried to hit the SUV back, go off the highway and ride right through the desert, or maybe ditch the car altogether. No, all of those things just seemed like prologing the inevitable. Suddenly, there was a loud thud, followed by Leo's fierce battlecry in Sanflarian.<br><br>Arnold turned to the passenger's seat and froze in shock. The naked blonde jumped right onto the SUV and held tight with her feet on the driver's window frame. The driver was surprised no less than the clerk and even more distracted by this close-up view of the countess' alluring pussy, which gave her time to act. Leo fearlessly drove her bare leg right into the criminal's face, hitting him with a knee. The SUV swerved as he lost control over the wheel, but his partner helped return it to the road with a handful of swears.<br><br>â€¶Shake her off, shake her off!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Shut up, I'm trying!â€¶<br><br>The SUV's rapid movement caused Leo to lose her footing, with one of her legs slipping from the window frame. However, she didn't hesitate and pulled herself up to the car's roof. The SUV went faster, its loud engine blocking Arnold's panicked screams. Both cars went highly above the speed limit, at least there were no civilians nearby. Eventually, the countess lost her grip and fell on the hood face-first, nearly dropping down onto the hot asphalt.<br><br>However, she wouldn't have become a windstriker if she gave up so easily. Instead, Leo decided to use her position to her advantage and got on all fours right in front of the criminals, holding herself in place with her limbs while her majestic ass blocked the driver's view. It caused plenty of distraction. The surprise, paired with an enticing effect of Leo's exposure, forced the criminal to act unwise and lose control over his vehicle, due to which it bumped into a guardrail that was handily installed on this part of the road.<br><br>â€¶Hey, be careful!â€¶ his friend shouted after flinching from the impact.<br><br>â€¶I can't see shit because of this slut!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Alright, gimme a second,â€¶ the passenger reached into his belt, pulling something out.<br><br>Arnold, who couldn't look away from this horrifying situation, quickly realized it was a loaded gun and warned Leo with his screaming. The countess leaped back onto the hood, akin to a monkey climbing a tree, right before the bullets hit the windshield and smashed it into pieces.<br><br>â€¶What are you doing, you moron?! It's a new car!!!â€¶ the driver screamed at his buddy, who was now busy reloading.<br><br>However, the two soon realized that the windshield was the last of their problems. With no glass blocking her path, Leo swung inside of the car and landed with her legs around the shooter's neck, practically hitting his face with her vulva. The driver tried his best to throw Leo back outside, but a couple of elbows quickly eased his temper.<br><br>Not wasting time, the countess opened the SUV's door and sent the armed criminal flying onto the road as he screamed in terror. With his partner rolling on asphalt far behind the car, the driver was left alone with the naked amazon.<br><br>â€¶I... I'm armed!â€¶ he tried to get his pistol with a yell.<br><br>It wasn't meant to be since Leo stopped him with a predatory grin, grabbing the gun and throwing it away like a piece of trash. Then, as if toying with him, Leo sat on his knees and pressed her boobs against the man's face while he struggled and tried his best to steer.<br><br>â€¶Your compliment was very kind, I bet you really want to see more of my body right now!â€¶ Leo began shaking her tits right into the driver's face with laughter, making him feel a mix of horniness and horror that he didn't know existed.<br><br>â€¶Stop, stop! You'll kill us both!â€¶<br><br>â€¶No worries, I'll be fine. Arnold, get my carriage!â€¶ the countess shouted as she opened the door, preparing for a jump.<br><br>The clerk got his car as close as he could, after which Leo leaped into the air and landed on the floor right beside him, her legs and butt sticking out of the convertible and providing yet another stunning view. The SUV's driver wasn't as fortunate: right when the blonde exited the car, he lost control, passed in front of the convertible, and flew straight into the guardrail. The ear-piercing noise rang out on the highway, followed by a cacophony of breaking glass and bending metal. The fencing didn't stop the car despite crashing its front. Instead, it overturned and flew into a ditch, burying its driver under its metal carcass. <br><br>â€¶Oh God...â€¶ Arnold commented, looking around.<br><br>Part of him wanted to stop and check for their enemies, but they couldn't waste time. And, seeing both criminals' injuries, it was hard to believe at least one of them survived this. And so he kept driving forward on pure adrenaline, deciding to postpone all thoughts about the chase, mortal danger, and killings he just experienced.<br><br>To the contrary, Leo didn't seem to mind any of that at all, busy with trying to get back into her seat. They passed a couple more cars like this, their drivers laughing and whistling at the sight of Leo's lower half, which was now on top as they mistook her for a pervy flasher. She managed to fix her position in a couple of minutes, wiping sweat off her brow and letting out a satisfied sigh.<br><br>â€¶Ha, we truly showed them! An exciting encounter, wasn't it?â€¶ the blonde laughed proudly.<br><br>â€¶E-exciting? Are you serious? We nearly got murdered, and then murdered someone ourselves!â€¶ Arnold's emotions poured through like a flood.<br><br>â€¶We fought a battle, and we won it. That's what life is about, my dear hostage,â€¶ she said in a wise tone, as if lecturing a child, â€¶you wouldn't expect it to always be smooth, now would you? Come on, why the long face? You liked it as well, admit it!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I... I didn't like it, I'm just helping you on your mission, that's all,â€¶ he defended himself.<br><br>But why would he do that? It was Arnold's dream to go on an action-packed CMNF adventure with a Sanflarian girl all along, yet now he just wanted to get this over with while a horde of anxious, fearful thoughts gathered in his brain. Perhaps he bit more than he could chew, but it was too late to think about it since the choice was already made. The only thing left was to finish his task and hope for the best. At least the naked girl made this process fun and kept him going.<br><br>***<br><br>For some time, the only things the duo saw around them were sand and sagebrushes, but soon a tower surrounded by several tall buildings appeared on the horizon, as if reaching to the burning sunset above it. They were getting closer to the city and the mystery of Milran's disappearance.<br><br>Arnold could feel it waiting for them, and while he still wanted to believe that nothing bad happened to the nobleman, their recent encounters threatened this point of view. As the Vegas' silhouette kept getting bigger, the duo suddenly noticed something else on the side of the road. It was a police car with two officers near it, one of whom was clearly commanding them to stop.<br><br>â€¶Great, what even is their problem?â€¶ Arnold sighed.<br><br>To him, having a naked girl in his car already became so normal he couldn't believe somebody would have a problem with it, but the local police surely had a different view.<br><br>â€¶G-good evening, officers,â€¶ the clerk said carefully while the cops looked at Leo with her feet still on the front panel.<br><br>One of the officers was a middle-aged Hispanic man who couldn't stop grinning from the surprise and the beautiful view that opened right in front of him. His colleague was a pale-skinned woman in her twenties with short, black hair and a stern gaze. While she tried looking serious, the blush on her cheeks clearly indicated that she was deeply uncomfortable, and Leo's shameless confidence already made her embarrassed.<br><br>â€¶Hello,â€¶ the countess said, spreading her legs on the panel as if trying to provoke them, â€¶are there any issues? We're in a hurry, so please, make it quick!â€¶<br><br>The man couldn't contain a chuckle, surprised even more by this attitude. He then introduced himself as officer Diego and his colleague as officer Kira and asked the duo to explain while one of them was riding in a car completely naked. Before the clerk could reply, Diego reminded him that this could be a misdemeanor, and his pretty friend can get fined for indecent exposure.<br><br>Saying that last part was surely a mistake: a hint of rage appeared in Leo's eyes once her naked body was called â€¶indecent.â€¶ It seemed like she was ready to fight for her right to be naked here and now.<br><br>â€¶L-listen, officers, we don't want any troubles,â€¶ Arnold spoke, realizing that he had to do something without hesitation.<br><br>And there was no reason to hesitate, too. Less than two hours ago, he barely survived while driving near an SUV with two armed criminals, the threats of these cops were nothing compared to them.<br><br>â€¶I'm from ICA,â€¶ his voice got louder and clearer as he pulled out his credentials, â€¶and this here is a noblewoman from a vast, powerful province of Kir'ador in western Sanflaria. She needs free passage to Vegas for an important diplomatic mission, which you are hindering by pulling us over.â€¶<br><br>Diego and Kira looked at each other in surprise but kept listening.<br><br>â€¶Moreover, your statement that Leo's... Lady Eleonora's public nudity is indecent offends her. As hosts of this diplomatic mission, we need to make sure that she and other Sanflarians feel as comfortable as possible!â€¶<br><br>Then, horniness and a weird sense of confidence took over his rational thinking for a moment, and the previously shy clerk added:<br><br>â€¶And... I'd even go as far as to say that it's offensive for Kira to be clothed right now. It's against Sanflarian religion for women to wear clothes, so if you wish to address Lady Eleonora respectfully, you need to strip naked yourself!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Indeed, that's correct,â€¶ Leo hurried to add, clearly satisfied with her â€¶hostage'sâ€¶ speech.<br><br>The hostage himself realized what he just said and let out an awkward laugh, while Kira's cheeks got even rosier.<br><br>â€¶What... How... Are you serious right now?!â€¶ The policewoman angrily folded her arms. â€¶I don't care if you're from ICA, CIA, FBI, I'm not going to degrade myself for your mission. Right, Diego? Diego?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Hm, I think he's not entirely wrong,â€¶ the male cop suddenly said, looking over his colleague's fit, slim figure.<br><br>Kira looked at her partner with shock, then glanced at Leo, who now had a cocky smile on her lips. Her eyes darted from side to side, clearly expecting all of this to be a weird joke or a prank pulled by her colleagues. It had to be since Diego couldn't seriously expect her to strip naked right here, on duty, that'd go against every code and rule in existence. Surely, this couldn't be the case...<br><br>â€¶H-here's your driver's license, seems to be okay,â€¶ Kira said in a shy voice five minutes later, handing the document back to Arnold while trying her best to cover herself and retain whatever dignity she had left.<br><br>Diego stood beside the brunette with her uniform and a large smile on his lips while she talked to Arnold and Leo wearing only her boots and police cap. The clerk still couldn't believe what he was seeing and kept ogling the girl's body as if to confirm that. His gaze wondered all over her hourglass figure, starting with her long, athletic legs, going up toward a patch of black hair covering her tender pussy, then raising toward her flat belly and, finally, thoroughly enjoying the view on her round, alluring tits that she tried so hard to cover with her hand. <br><br>â€¶Y-you may go, thanks for your cooperation,â€¶ she said with her head down and her cheeks red like tomatoes.<br><br>â€¶Thanks for your service!â€¶ Leo saluted her with a cheerful laugh while Arnold shyly got his ID back and started the car.<br><br>Good thing that junkie didn't reach out to the police about his convertible being stolen, the clerk thought, else there'd be trouble. He also wanted to tell them about Leo and him getting attacked, but the countess seemed against it, still skeptical of other officials. And so they drove toward their goal, leaving the friendly cops behind.<br><br>Diego waved and wished them a nice day while Kira stood all hunched up and kept poking her colleague, hoping to get her clothing back and end this humiliation. Now that was a situation Arnold would call exciting. Maybe Leo was right, and he did enjoy their adventure, at least a little.<br><br>As the sun began to disappear in the evening sky, the duo started seeing buildings and cars on the roadside, a clear indication that they were finally nearing their destination." },
      { title: "Chapter 8", summary: "Las Vegas Strip", content: "â€¶Alright, m'lady, we're in, now we just need to find that hotel.â€¶<br><br>Leo nodded to Arnold's words, feeling both pressure to find out what happened to Milran and a bit of awe at the view before her eyes. The barren desert was now behind them, giving way to a vast street, surrounded by skyscrapers with luxurious housing and establishments that only the loaded wallets could afford.<br><br>The sun was already gone, but the city's lights kept the road lit up with a flurry of vibrant colors. From cars' headlights to shiny letters and billboards trying to lure in the drivers, the shining was everywhere, leaving the night powerless. It was nice to see, since the city's atmosphere and architecture was certainly worth a look.<br><br>For a moment, Leo felt dizzy since the contrast with the desert was a bit too much. However, it didn't take the countess long to adjust and breathe in the view around her, finding joy in this moment despite her worries and concerns. While Arnold made sure to drive toward the Caesar's Palace, Leo volunteered to look around and even got up from her seat, causing the clerk to fear for her safety even more. However, she didn't care. She simply stood, holding the top of the windshield and enjoying the feeling of her mane blowing in the wind.<br><br>It quickly became clear that Leo wasn't the only one enjoying the view: the blonde's naked body was on display far more than before, causing entire crowds of people to turn their heads and admire her beauty. There were catcalls, laughs, and even some applause as the convertible drove through the busy city, lighting up the moods of all those who saw its naked passenger.<br><br>It felt like the countess was on a stage with the shining of billboards and lanterns falling on her curves, allowing the numerous spectators to see her breasts, her flat belly, and even her tight pussy in great detail. The drivers made sure to also check out the naked girl, and soon a small line formed behind the duo with everyone eager to get a nice look at Leo's athletic butt.<br><br>â€¶Wow, no wonder they call this place sin city!â€¶ One of the passersby shouted in disbelief while his friend tried to get a picture.<br><br>â€¶Ha, you've seen nothing yet!â€¶ Leo replied and slapped her butt like a naughty stripper, reveling in the public attention.<br><br>Arnold sighed. Now everyone and their dog knew that the countess was here, and she was completely exposed in more ways than one, meaning that one bullet would be enough to prematurely end her mission. And yet, the clerk couldn't stop admiring the naked girl for her boldness. She truly combined business with pleasure very well, and with such an attitude, it wasn't hard to imagine her being a role model for her subjects.<br><br>Their ride lasted several more minutes, with Leo posing for her spotaneous audience and not forgetting to shake both her butt and tits to â€¶treat them with a real female beauty for onceâ€¶. It was clear that even if some Earthian sights have impressed her, she'll never stop viewing her cultural customs as superior. Then again, judging by all of the positive reception she was getting, maybe some of the locals agreed.<br><br>â€¶There, I see it!â€¶ Leo's voice suddenly pierced the noisy air.<br><br>The clerk raised his head and noticed a large set of buildings in the distance. The letters on the biggest one read â€¶Caesar's Palace,â€¶ and the complex itself looked like modern and ancient architecture were blended together during its construction, as its contemporary design neighbored massive columns and acroteria.<br><br>Yet Leo furrowed her brow and grabbed the windshield harder as they approached. It wasn't a famous five-star hotel for this girl. In her eyes, it was a prison, or even a torture chamber. As soon as Arnold parked the car on the roadside, Leo jumped out of her seat and went for the main entrance so fast he could barely keep up. <br><br>Just before her bare feet could feel the hotel's floor, Leo looked down at herself and realized she looked a bit dirty. Her naked body had stains of motor oil and a coating of sand on it, probably owing to those car shenanings she did earlier. While the countess was eager to meet Milran, she realized that her look could've been by him as inappropriate, so she had to fix this. After a quick look around, Leo stopped on the Palace's fountain, a large body of water with a collection of sculptures in its center. The water poured down from the stone amphoras and animal jaws, perfect for a quick shower. <br><br>Before Arnold could say anything, the blonde walked right into the fountain, letting the flow envelop her and make her skin glisten. As Leo began her improvised shower, rubbing her alluring curves and shaking her body under the cool streams, a crowd gathered around the fountain with smiles and cameras, ready to capture this unusual tourism experience. The clerk didn't say a word, captivated by Leo's graceful movements along with all other passersby.<br><br>In five minutes, Leo had thoroughly cleaned herself and let the surrounding people see her from a wide variety of angles. Her â€¶hostageâ€¶ couldn't bring himself to look away, momentarily forgetting about the danger they were facing. He knew that most Sanflarian females wouldn't hesitate to use open bodies of water to cool off. They even had special street showers for girls and women to use on a hot day. After all, what was there to hide? Still, seeing this done in his world was unusual not only for Earthians but probably for most Sanflarian women as well.<br><br>As the countess walked back to the clerk, she turned around and pointed at her back.<br><br>â€¶I can feel there's some sand there still, but I can't reach it. Could you clean it off?â€¶<br><br>Arnold shouldn't have been too surprised by this request, especially considering how they spent last night, but washing this girl's back in public still made his hands tremble in delight. Without hesitation, he began rubbing Leo's back and carefully removing any sand that was still there. Some guy made a crack about how lucky Arnold was, and he felt it was true, despite all the difficulties. He got a bit carried away though and came back to his senses only when he was already rubbing Leo's buttcheeks.<br><br>â€¶Thanks for the help, but I could've reached that place myself,â€¶ the countess smirked, followed by a couple laughs from the crowd.<br><br>He removed his hands with a shy smile, and Leo retorted by splashing him with cold water. After adjusting her wet hair, the countess walked to the front entrance with her head up high. Arnold gently grabbed her arm and stepped alongside her, praying that neither of the surrounding tourists would try to shoot her. The two reached a spacious reception with a powerful AC. Arnold shivered a little while Leo kept her composure, even though her wet nipples became erect from the cold.<br><br>â€¶What a disgrace!â€¶ A tourist woman shouted and covered her son's eyes.<br><br>â€¶Mo-o-om, stop, I've already turned eighteen yesterday. I can look!â€¶ He protested, trying to free himself from the parental grip.<br><br>Leo replied with a scoff and turned her attention to the receptionist, a young girl who seemed equally surprised and amused. There was a couple in line before the noblewoman, but they stepped aside after seeing her piercing gaze. She didn't waste time and landed one of her legs right on the receptionist's table to assert dominance, causing the girl to blush with her exposed front, especially her vulva, perfectly highlighted by this pose.<br><br>â€¶Alright, this can go two ways,â€¶ Leo began in a seducing yet threatening tone, â€¶you can either tell me where my cousin is, or I'll get this information myself... Along with your clothes.â€¶<br><br>The receptionist blushed even more, looking at her neat set of blouse and skirt. For a moment, Arnold became doubtful about what she was going to choose, but the nearby ICA personnel stopped their exchange before she could respond. Two broad-shouldered men ran up to Leo and urged her to talk with them on a nearby couch.<br><br>Though reluctant at first, she eventually agreed. Then came a long session of them trying to talk her out of going to Milran herself, suggesting she instead focuses on protecting herself. Leo listened to this and rolled her eyes while her legs were spread and her chest was puffed out, as if mocking ICA's concerns.<br><br>â€¶Lady Eleonora, we promise you we will handle everything as...â€¶<br><br>â€¶You've already handled enough,â€¶ the countess suddenly jumped up from her seat, tired of wasting her time. â€¶Now lead me to Milran's room or Kir'ador will know of your insolence!â€¶<br><br>The big guys looked at each other, then glanced at Arnold with furrowed brows. The clerk was about to start talking sense to Leo himself, but the officers quickly calmed down and let her have her way, albeit with plenty of grumbling. Finally, the blonde went up the stairs along with the operatives, surprising and amusing tourists she met on her way. One of them got so distracted he even bumped right into one of her tits, to which she simply shoved him away, fully focused on her mission.<br><br>â€¶Milran!â€¶ She shouted, opening the door to her cousin's presidential suite.<br><br>The room was ample and luxurious, with pricy furniture and dÃ©cor surrounding the halls and staircases leading to other parts of the dwelling. And yet, Leo didn't see her cousin among this luxury. Instead, the girl met several ICA agents searching through every nook and cranny of the suite. The drawers were opened, Milran's notebooks were lying on the table, and the agents' faces instantly told Leo that everything was far from alright.<br><br>â€¶Explain yourselves,â€¶ Leo furrowed her brow, entering a fighting stance.<br><br>Each of the four armed men in front of her visibly flinched, while the two that accompanied her tried to calm the countess down. Then a confident female voice rang out from the suite's second floor:<br><br>â€¶Please, Lady Eleonora, we're not your enemies.â€¶<br><br>With these words, a blonde in her thirties descended from the spiral staircase. She was tall and athletic, clad in a military uniform that suggested she was an ICA captain. Her glasses, serious look in her eyes, and a short ponytail behind her back underlined this imposing image. It didn't work on Leo, however, as the countess walked right up to the woman and repeated her questions.<br><br>â€¶Your cousin is currently missing. We are trying to understand where he could've gone since his phone does not respond and his belongings are still in the room. I am Captain Davis, and I am leading this mission.â€¶<br><br>Everyone could feel rage building up inside Leo as she looked around the room.<br><br>â€¶Missing? He's been kidnapped, and your inability to recognize this puts you on the list of suspects!â€¶ the blonde pointed at Davis.<br><br>â€¶Lady Eleonora, we have nothing to gain from harming Lord Milran,â€¶ the captain parried. â€¶Currently, we're doing our best to locate him so our mission could proceed as usual. We've already talked to his butlers and reviewed the CCTV footage, but nothing of value was found.â€¶<br><br>The captain's voice sounded sincere, and her eyes were full of concern, but it didn't seem to convince the enraged countess.<br><br>â€¶And how can I trust that you're acting in our interests and aren't lying to me?â€¶ Leo raised her eyebrow.<br><br>â€¶We will do anything in our power to make sure the process is as clear and transparent.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Then strip naked,â€¶ the blonde commanded.<br><br>The room fell silent. Davis couldn't believe what she just heard, and her voice started to tremble.<br><br>â€¶W-what do you mean?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I said that you, captain, must show loyalty to my people's cause by removing your clothes,â€¶ Leo repeated even louder, â€¶if you're unable to do so, I'll consider this a sign of your insincerity. What are you waiting for? You said you'd do everything!â€¶<br><br>â€¶M'lady, I don't think...â€¶ Arnold gently grabbed Leo's arm and tried his best to talk her out of this crazy idea, but she seemed to remember that cop and Latino girl proving that it was the best way to test a woman's dedication.<br><br>â€¶And I do think it's a good move,â€¶ the countess interrupted her travel buddy.<br><br>A second later, Davis was already the center of attention as everyone waited for her response. Her fellow agents already began objecting to Leo's idea, saying that Earthians are free to follow their own cultural customs while on Earth and that undressing the captain would've been disrespectful. The captain kept silence for a minute, as if not sure what to say... And then she began undoing the buttons on her coat.<br><br>â€¶C-captain,â€¶ one of the operatives said, taken aback by this action.<br><br>â€¶I said that we'll ensure Leo's trust by any means necessary. Working in ICA doesn't just mean keeping Sanflarians safe on US soil, it also means doing everything to better our relations. If the countess needs me to be naked to feel safe around us, I'll do it.â€¶<br><br>The men stared at Davis in disbelief as she reluctantly took off her clothes, one item at a time. First her outer clothing, which revealed her beautiful, feminine curves that perfectly blended with her athletic physique. Then her bulletproof vest and shirt, leaving her top half covered only by a red lingerie.<br><br>â€¶Wow, I didn't know Davis' underwear was so skimpy,â€¶ one of the soldiers whispered to another, who promptly told him to shut up.<br><br>The captain's breathing became more hectic as she continued to undress, taking off both her shoes and pants. The males' gazes were now chained to her long legs and backside, covered only by a red thong. Nobody said a word, but it became very hard for the men to contain their excitement once Davis took off her bra and freed her majestic D-cup tits.<br><br>In the very next moment, she did the same with her panties, allowing everyone to glance at her backside and shaven vulva. The agents who served under this woman for years saw her like this for the first time, though some of them fantasized what she'd look like without the uniform.<br><br>Davis let out a sigh and hesitated for a second, then stood up with her head up high and saluted the countess, remaining a professional despite everything. She was now only wearing her glasses and the belt, which had her weapon and a walkie-talkie on it, while the rest of her uniform was lying on the floor like a pile of garbage. It wasn't hard to notice that it took Davis all of her courage to do this and keep herself from covering herself, yet she persisted.<br><br>â€¶I hope this satisfies you, Lady Eleonora,â€¶ she said clearly and loudly, her nipples becoming harder from the cold.<br><br>Leo slowly evaluated the captain's figure from head to toe, clearly impressed by her actions.<br><br>â€¶Indeed, I did not expect you to follow my demands so thoroughly... Let's continue the search together,â€¶ she said with a satisfied grin.<br><br>The naked ladies shook their hands, and Davis continued to lead her squad like nothing out of the ordinary was happening. Still, during their search, it became clear that the productivity had dropped: the men simply couldn't concentrate on finding clues, instead glancing at their commander's body.<br><br>Especially when her ass got highlighted by her bending down or her breasts began to bounce from sudden movements. But, of course, not a single operative was bold enough to say this out loud, and instead they pretended to work their hardest, which was true in a slightly different way than usual.<br><br>On the other hand, Leo was quite handy at reading Milran's texts in Sanflarian, though they all were about his mission and didn't provide much new information.<br><br>â€¶Hm, what is this, I wonder?â€¶ the countess finally found an odd piece of paper filled with scribbles.<br><br>â€¶Is this some kind of code?â€¶ Arnold asked, still unable to read a word in Sanflarian despite working with it for a year.<br><br>â€¶No, just Sanflarian numbers. Calculations. For what I'm not sure, but the final number is quite high... Much more than the money he had on him for sure. Maybe it was left by the kidnappers to demand ransom.â€¶<br><br>â€¶But why would his kidnappers write in Sanflarian?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Because they intended Sanflarians to read it, of course!â€¶ Leo parried, ignoring another possible implication.<br><br>Outside of this crumbled paper, the search was inconclusive. Davis was about to call her squad off, but Leo was having none of that.<br><br>â€¶I'm sure he had to leave something for us to find! If he left me a message, there must be something else.â€¶<br><br>â€¶But we've searched everywhere,â€¶ Davis landed her naked butt near Leo and put her arm on the countess' shoulder, â€¶it seems like there is nothing else of value.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, wait!â€¶ Leo got up, attracting attention to both her idea and her chest. â€¶I know where he could've hidden something. His favorite hiding spot, how could I forget?â€¶<br><br>Right after that, Leo rushed to the spacious bedroom with a king-sized bed. The ICA group followed, only to find the blonde bent over across the bed and trying to reach something between the parts of the wooden frame.<br><br>â€¶When Milran was younger, his parents once found a naughty magazine hidden in this little crevice,â€¶ Leo explained.<br><br>â€¶Wait, a naughty journal?â€¶ Arnold felt there was a logical error.<br><br>â€¶Yes. It was from Earth and had women with colorful underwear on every page. Absolutely disgusting!â€¶<br><br>Finally, the blonde emerged with a little card, showing a short message and an imprint of lips covered by red lipstick. Davis was overjoyed by this find, while the men were a little sad. They really liked the sight of Leo standing atop the bed on her knees. Still, it was a clue, and an intriguing one.<br><br>â€¶I'll see you near the third blackjack table at ten,â€¶ Leo read in confusion.<br><br>â€¶He must've attended another meeting here, and this one was less formal,â€¶ Arnold said with a laugh, but shut up once he realized nobody found this funny.<br><br>â€¶The lipstick is very dry. Someone must've given this card to him a day ago or even earlier,â€¶ the captain concluded, â€¶and the third table surely means the one on the first floor, in the casino section of the hotel.â€¶<br><br>â€¶We're heading out, then!â€¶ The countess said with a voice full of energy, â€¶I don't know who wrote this, but I'm going to find her and make her tell me everything!â€¶<br><br>Davis was quick to gather her guys to scout whether the way ahead was clear. After a couple minutes, one of them reported that no suspicious persons were found and they could move out. The captain glanced at her clothing but met Leo's judgmental stare and let out another sigh. In the next minute, both women left the room stark naked, their bare feet enjoying the carpet on the floor while their pleasant curves jiggled with each step.<br><br>Davis' face got red like a tomato once they encountered their first spectators, an old couple leaving their suite for dinner. Still, the captain kept her composure and stepped forward just beside Leo, earning both the respect and lust of her fellow employees. If not for her discipline, she'd already run and hid somewhere in a closet. Arnold followed the two and soon got in-between them, feeling his excitement rising as both females held him arm in arm, making him seem like a womanizer.<br><br>After a long hallway walk with plenty of other tourists to bump into, the group got into a glass elevator, showcasing the girls' nakedness to all the patrons dining and relaxing on the lower floors. The casino was just nearby, and the captain was sure that somebody had to remember seeing the nobleman there. Now the main thing was to determine who invited Milran and where he went after that. That surely won't be easy, but at least the two naked knockouts will keep the possible witnesses from getting distracted." },
      { title: "Chapter 9", summary: "Night at the Palace", content: "The casino was a spacious realm of beige and brown, illuminated by a system of white lights with a shining sphere in its center that looked like a little sun. Here contemporary furniture was paired with Greek dÃ©cor, and priceless statues overlooked dozens of gambling machines like rigid judges. The way there was quite crowded, it was vacation season after all. Many guests decided to use the elevator, especially male ones, which surely had something to do with a couple of naked beauties riding in it. As the free space in the elevator lessened, both women got closer to Arnold, practically pressing their boobs into his face.<br><br>All kinds of thoughts rushed through the clerk's head, starting with obvious horniness and ending with a scary realization that one of those girls was his superior, and the second was a noble whom he had to protect with his life. Good thing other operatives kept the trio safe, blocking the unwanted attention. Still, one sneaky guy managed to pinch the butts of both girls, to which Davis grunted, and Leo simply let out a chuckle. The cultural differences between Earth and Sanflaria were palpable.<br><br>Finally, they got to the casino floor, and the agents began their quick sweep around the area to ensure that it was safe. It was less than ten minutes, but for Davis it seemed like an hour as she had to stand along with Leo completely naked at the casino's entrance with all of those entering and leaving ogling her body. However, it became much worse when they walked to the blackjack tables, attracting the gazes of more than a hundred people gambling and enjoying their drinks all around the room.<br><br>â€¶Damn, what a lucky guy. He must be really wealthy!â€¶ some dude in the corner pointed at Arnold.<br><br>â€¶Are you two gamblers or a prize for the winners?â€¶ an old man chuckled, slapping Leo's butt as she passed him by.<br><br>â€¶Wait, is it CMNF evening or something? Should I ditch the dress?â€¶ a woman with a ton of jewelry and make-up on asked her husband, who seemed surprised by her idea even more than by the naked duo.<br><br>The naked women, along with Arnold, kept walking between the rows of slot machines with people turning around behind them, some of them tipsy and others invigorated by gambling. One of the guests even missed his jackpot, realizing that what he saw was far less common. This sea of patrons continued in front of them, but soon they saw a man dressed in a beige tuxedo who looked a bit different from everyone else.<br><br>â€¶Good evening! I'm this casino's manager, and I'm glad to welcome you, Lady Eleonora, into our fine establishment,â€¶ he said very quickly, kissing the countess' hand.<br><br>Leo liked this introduction but frowned upon realizing that even the hotel's staff knew of her arrival.<br><br>â€¶We intended to keep it as a secret,â€¶ Davis explained, trying her best to concentrate on the task and forget about her shame, â€¶however, it'd be much harder for ICA to secure the location that way, and, well, you don't exactly blend in with the crowd.â€¶<br><br>Leo was about to scold the captain for this carelessness but couldn't beat her argument. Besides, just seeing her naked figure and the embarrassment in her eyes was enough to prove her loyalty to the cause. The countess decided to do what she was always taught by her family and play the hand she was dealt.<br><br>â€¶We need to find a specific table. I think my cousin was playing there with a woman, and I'd like to meet them very much,â€¶ she said in a sweet tone, masking her rage very well.<br><br>The manager listened and acted professionally, leading the naked girls to their destination and only glancing at their bare curves once. Arnold followed closely behind, not sure whether to be glad about being in such a place with such company or scared for Milran's fate and its implications. The positive side gradually took over, as none of the world's problems seemed that serious when you had two amazing asses wiggling right in front of you.<br><br>Meanwhile, the naked blondes reached the table, showered by the gazes and comments of the surrounding people as if they were celebrities. Manager tried to calm the patrons down, especially those who ran up to the nudies and took selfies with them, but quickly gave up and let the girls defend themselves. Leo didn't see his help as necessary anyway since she was flattered by attention and made sure to pose whenever she could. The posing wasn't the best since she was in a hurry, but still a stark contrast to Captain Davis, who stood there blushing and unmoving with her head down.<br><br>â€¶The table's pretty busy,â€¶ Davis said to move attention toward the case.<br><br>Indeed, there were four players present, leaving only one spot open. The dealer, a skinny man in his twenties, did his job with impressive agility and refused to look up from the table even when called by Leo.<br><br>â€¶Hello?â€¶ the countess repeated and walked up to the man.<br><br>He simply continued tossing the cards around, even when all players shifted their focus to the naked ladies.<br><br>â€¶I'm addressing you, sir,â€¶ Leo placed her leg right on the table, showcasing her entire front in a dominant fashion.<br><br>A couple more seconds, and she'd just grab this stoic man who refused to pay her any attention, but thankfully the manager interjected and made him talk to her.<br><br>â€¶Apologies, miss. I was simply busy with the current round... It's not good for a dealer to lose track of his cards, you know.â€¶<br><br>â€¶You seem to be good at paying attention,â€¶ Leo replied, seeing that he looked her straight into the eyes despite her keeping her foot on the table, â€¶do you remember a blonde man, average height, who played here at ten either yesterday or a day before? He was with some kind of woman.â€¶<br><br>The man looked into the distance while doing odd tricks with his fingers, as if trying to reach deep into his memory.<br><br>â€¶No, unfortunately, I wasn't at this table those days. And, well, as you could've guessed, I don't look around much.â€¶<br><br>This response disappointed the blonde so much she even stepped back from the table, but it didn't mean she was going to give up.<br><br>â€¶No worries, Lady Eleonora, we simply need to find the dealer who was at the third table,â€¶ Davis said, reassuring her partner in nakedness.<br><br>Leo nodded, looking at the captain with a hint of respect that wasn't there a minute ago. She seemed to recognize that it was difficult for Earthian females to go naked in public, even though she found this idea completely absurd. So to see somebody going against her fear of nudity and still finding the strength to care about others was surprising, and not in a bad way.<br><br>â€¶No need to search for another dealer,â€¶ a large, old man at the table said, looking up from his drink, â€¶I was there at ten. In fact, I'm always here at ten.â€¶<br><br>â€¶So you remember where Milran went?!â€¶ Leo instantly got so agitated that she lunged forward and landed her knees on the table, throwing all of the manager's restraint out of the window as her majestic ass was now right in front of his face.<br><br>â€¶Indeed. Only he wasn't blonde... Wore some kind of a wig or something. I knew the hair looked fake, only a fool wouldn't notice,â€¶ the old-timer added.<br><br>â€¶Wait, how did you know it was my cousin then?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Because he couldn't shut up about being an upstanding nobleman from an upstanding family, and there was a naked woman on his phone's main screen. Some mistook him for a pervy Britishman, but I read the news and connected the dots. Name's Chuck, by the way, I'm a professional gambler. Looking into people is a part of my profession, you see.â€¶<br><br>The manager scoffed at the last sentence while Leo shook her head in disapproval.<br><br>â€¶Talking about his upbringing in a place like this? That's Milran alright... Uh, no offense.â€¶<br><br>She then urged Chuck to continue, but he rubbed his chin and said something nobody expected:<br><br>â€¶Huh, how about we make it a bit more interesting instead?â€¶<br><br>â€¶What do you mean?!â€¶ both the countess and the captain folded their arms, the latter even forgot about being embarrassed for a second.<br><br>â€¶Well, you are a lovely, naked lady with no shame whatsoever. I'm a wealthy, old man with too much time on my hands.â€¶<br><br>â€¶If you're going where I think you're going with this, I'd rather beat this information out of ya!â€¶<br><br>Chuck laughted Leo's accusation off, unfazed by the dozen of disapproving gazes staring right into him.<br><br>â€¶He-he, you think too poorly of me. Of course, I don't mean it like that. I was simply looking for a game. See, I'm so good nowadays that even this guy with his eyesight has a hard time beating me. These guys here aren't that simple as well.â€¶<br><br>As he pointed at the other four men sitting beside him, they grinned.<br><br>â€¶I think we could all use a challenge. How about we play blackjack, and if you manage to defeat us, I'll tell you everything you wanna know. On the other hand, if one of us wins, you'll give the victor a nice private dance. Always wanted to feel how it's like, when it's done by a noble instead of a regular stripper.â€¶<br><br>â€¶A game? We don't have time for this!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Trust me, if what I know is true, then we have an entire evening.â€¶ Chuck said, pushing Leo's interest even further, â€¶but twenty minutes of blackjack should be enough. Your cousin should be safe, at least for some time. I don't think people like her would finish quickly either way.â€¶<br><br>Leo pressured him to reveal what he knew, yet Chuck remained silent, simply pointing at the table at which he just won yet another game. Davis, the manager and even Arnold tried convincing Chuck that it was in his best interest to cooperate with ICA, that it was wrong to take advantage of a woman trying to find her cousin and that he's threatening the success of a governmental mission. Nothing worked.<br><br>â€¶Alright, have it your way,â€¶ Leo gave in, much to the delight of Chuck and other players who gave him a high-five, â€¶you just want me to play with you for twenty minutes and that's it?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes. As a dealer,â€¶ the man added, surprising everyone around him.<br><br>It seemed like he didn't just intend to win with a distraction nearby, he wanted to try winning while the distraction was right in his face. Eleonora quickly understood this and smirked at the suggestion. This man truly thought he could best her while tempted by her marvelous nudity. It wasn't just a bet now, it was a challenge. Judging by Leo's gaze, she was ready to accept it and beat the old-timer at his own game.<br><br>â€¶He probably thinks others will fold at the sight of my breasts and pussy while he keeps his composure and wins,â€¶ the blonde whispered to her allies, â€¶but we'll see... I think he'll get more than he bargained for.â€¶<br><br>Thankfully, Sanflaria had a similar game, so it didn't take the dealer long to make sure Leo understood the rules correctly, and in several minutes, the bets were done.<br><br>The countess, now taking the role of a regular employee, began giving each player cards with a smile on her face. Her boobs bounced from each sudden movement, while her vagina was right below the men's eye level, perfectly complemented by the flat belly above it. The view was so alluring that one of the players felt hot right away and had to take another sip of his drink. The game wasn't going to be simple.<br><br>â€¶Looking good,â€¶ Chuck said, glancing both at his cards, making it seem like he didn't care about the naked dealer at all.<br><br>Leo took this as a challenge and leaned forward, giving the players an even better look at her breasts while they were deciding on their next move. Larry, the youngest one sitting in the middle, already began succumbing to Leo's charm, causing her to smirk with the gaze of a predator. She bent over the cards and posed like somebody took pictures of her, making sure the men couldn't get their eyes away from her nudity.<br><br>This shamelessness didn't sway Chuck or Paul, another old-timer sitting at the other end of the table. On the other hand, a large man named Oswald was clearly tempted, even though he tried hiding it. He had that sleazebag look to him, so Leo was confident she'd get her way.<br><br>â€¶Hit,â€¶ Larry said with a goofy smile.<br><br>He and Arnold had a lot in common, the countess thought as she handed him another card.<br><br>â€¶I'm standing,â€¶ Chuck said with a grin.<br><br>â€¶He's got nothing. Double down,â€¶ Paul reacted.<br><br>Seeing that Oswald hesitated, Leo clouded his brain even more by shaking her boobs right in his face, making sure everyone could see that impressive chest of hers.<br><br>â€¶What's the matter, see something you like?â€¶ She asked, seeing the man sweat.<br><br>â€¶Hit, yeah, hit,â€¶ he said with uncertainty. <br><br>The first round ended, resulting in Chuck's win after he masterfully manipulated Paul to double down. Larry asked for another card, bringing him dangerously close to going over 21, but to him, it was worth it to get Leo's attention. The countess noted this and got more creative with dealing during the second round. At first, she just gracefully stretched while handing out the cards, but as the game went on, her moves got even hotter.<br><br>She started ludging cards in-between her boobs and making men get them on their own, touching her chest in the process. Then, the girl went even further and bent over in front of the table, showcasing her backside with a card peeking out of her butt. But she still gave the most attention to Larry, for whom she grabbed a card with her mouth and brought it right into his hand like a fetching dog.<br><br>This spiraled into a show of both erotica and comedy, with the players and the surrounding people laughing at Leo's charismatic game. In fact, it attracted so much attention that a small crowd formed around the table, making it seem like tonight's main event. Despite Leo focusing on her mission, it was visible that she had tons of fun herself, especially by her sincere chuckles and her nipples getting harder and harder throughout the game.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, Larry and Oswald began losing their cool quite early, while Chuck seemed impenetrable. Paul also didn't care for Leo's schemes, which she found odd at first, up until realizing that he kept looking somewhere under the table. This oddity took her a moment to figure out, but then Arnold, who also watched attentively, whispered the word â€¶feetâ€¶ into her ear and made everything clear. To prove this theory, Leo raised her leg and ludged a card in-between her toes, ready to deal Paul his next card without her arms. The man instantly flinched as if seeing a ghost and couldn't concentrate anymore.<br><br>â€¶I used to find this fetish strange sometime ago,â€¶ Leo said to the old-timer, feeling his tension, â€¶but then I came to understand that every part of a woman is beautiful, so there's nothing wrong with this preference. It's quite exciting for many Sanflarians too, partially because the majority of our women keep their feet covered to protect them from heat or damage, which makes them seem tender and delicate. I, on the other hand, believe in the benefits of massage and challenging your body, so I always go barefoot!â€¶<br><br>This monologue made Paul lose his cool even more, making him imagine all those beautiful legs of Sanflarian females and admire Leo's boldness.<br><br>â€¶I see she found your weak spot,â€¶ Chuck let out a laugh, â€¶let's test your self-control now, Paulie.â€¶<br><br>The game went on, with Chuck and Leo winning an equal amount of times while others followed closely behind. The blonde was getting out of breath with her sexy poses as she practically did yoga in front of the table, trying to appeal to every player at once. When the final round came, the girl decided to go all-in and got right on the table. The men sat speechless as she climbed up and sat right in front of them with her legs spread as wide as possible, holding the deck just below her breasts and letting everyone enjoy the look of her shaven pussy.<br><br>â€¶Ready?â€¶ She asked in a sweet tone as the round of cheers and applause echoed through the casino.<br><br>Chuck slid his hat low on his forehead and prepared for the final battle, others became agitated as well. As expected, Leo made sure to deal Paul's cards with her bare foot, driving him crazy with each elegant move of her legs. Then came Larry, who kept asking her to add more hard to his hand until it was full.<br><br>â€¶Be careful, or you'll bust!â€¶ Chuck laughted at the duality of his own joke.<br><br>â€¶The first one to surrender will get a chance to freely grope my breasts,â€¶ Leo stated once everyone got their cards, leaning backward to make her position even more indecent.<br><br>â€¶Ha, good choice, but...â€¶ Chuck was about to scold the girl for being naÃ¯ve, yet was interrupted by Oswald who ran up to the blonde from behind and put his large hands over her tits.<br><br>â€¶Uh, just be careful, you're rubbing them like they're magical!â€¶ Leo laughted while Chuck shook his head in disapproval.<br><br>The second to fall was Larry: when the round was nearing its end, it turned out he did go over 21, which means he lost the final game. It didn't bother the young man that much since he instantly got up and left for the bathroom. Arnold understood him very well, Leo's charm truly made thinking straight impossible at times. Paul seemed to agree, as during the last phase he simply blurted out â€¶standingâ€¶ and began licking Leo's toes. The countess didn't even object to being caressed by two men at once, just giggled when their touches got ticklish.<br><br>â€¶Well, it seems like you came far,â€¶ Chuck said, â€¶but it doesn't even matter.â€¶<br><br>The old-timer showed the countess his cards. It was 21, which meant that during this chaos, he managed to get his hand exactly right.<br><br>â€¶Hm, not bad. But I beg to differ!â€¶<br><br>With these words, Leo revealed the last card she was holding. Her total hand had a total of 21 as well. The crowd gasped, and even the professional gambler himself seemed surprised.<br><br>â€¶How did you manage to... Well, doesn't matter. Unfortunately, it seems like the information about your cousin will be left unsaid today.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?!â€¶ Leo suddenly pushed both men aside, causing Oswald to fall, and boldly stood on the table, â€¶you said you'll tell me everything if I beat you!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, and I wanted a private dance if I'll come out on top. However, it's a tie, which means we both lost.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I disagree. Since we both got 21, it must mean we both won. Do you follow?â€¶ the blonde asked, squatting in front of Chuck with a mysterious spark in her eyes.<br><br>â€¶Oh, I think I do.â€¶<br><br>***<br><br>Leo moved with both grace and confidence, slowly stepping around Chuck who sat without motion, mesmerized by the curves of her majestic body. To the contrary, the countess didn't hold back at all. She began by going behind Chuck and caressing his chest while landing her breasts on his head. As he looked up, she slowly moved to his side, suggestively putting her bare leg between his. Stretching like a professional pole dancer, she nearly sat on Chuck's lap, only to trick him and turn around, shaking her butt right into his face. <br><br>After another spin, the girl's foot landed on the chair's back as she breathed in the crowd's fascination. Her moves were unusual but compelling. Casino music wasn't exactly erotic, but Leo was master of her body and knew how to improvise. She kept approaching the old man and then slipping away, like a cunning fox outrunning her pursuers.<br><br>This sexual game culminated when the countess firmly grabbed the chair's back and jumped up, lunging herself into the air while keeping herself balanced with her hands. She held herself vertically above Chuck's head upside down and spread her legs, showing off her beautiful bottom half to the cheering crowd around her. After this display of acrobatics, Leo masterfully swung back and landed right on Chuck's lap, facing him for a moment and then pushing his face right into her breasts, much to the audience's amazement. <br><br>â€¶Sanflaria must truly have different culture. I can't imagine this being the norm for any of our nobles,â€¶ Davis commented.<br><br>Arnold glanced at the captain and blushed a bit, momentarily forgetting she was naked. Davis enjoyed a bit of a respite while all eyes were on Leo, though a couple drunk men did annoy her by asking for a dance or â€¶her rates for the nightâ€¶. One of them got off easy, simply receiving a slap, while the other had his arm broken and stopped thinking about girls at all. <br><br>â€¶Knowing her, I doubt it's the norm in Sanflaria as well. Leo's just crazy. In her own, beautiful way.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I see you've grown very fond of her,â€¶ the captain said with a smirk, noting Arnold's loving tone.<br><br>â€¶It'd be hard not to. Although, I gotta say, it's still... A bit scary.â€¶<br><br>Davis' smirk got even wider.<br><br>â€¶Just as many things in life,â€¶ the captain concluded, fending off yet another pervert with an elbow, â€¶trust me, today I learned that very well.â€¶<br><br>Back on the â€¶stageâ€¶, Chuck lost his cool for a moment and grabbed Leo right by her taut, beautiful asscheeks. The countess removed his hands and jumped up right away, pinning the old man to his chair with a strong grip.<br><br>â€¶Now it's your turn! Tell me everything you know or suffer consequences.â€¶<br><br>Chuck didn't protest, although this sudden mood swing made him jump a little.<br><br>â€¶Alright-alright,â€¶ the man said, finishing his drink, â€¶I have no reason to play with your emotions any longer.â€¶<br><br>Leo didn't hesitate and began asking when Chuck saw Milran, who was the woman with him and why was he wearing a wig.<br><br>â€¶Alright-alright,â€¶ the old man got up from his seat, â€¶let's start from the beginning. I truly played with your cousin, although he clearly didn't want me to identify him. Gave me a fake name, something like... Nilmar.â€¶<br><br>Leo rolled her eyes, thinking that mayhaps allowing him to take this mission wasn't the best idea.<br><br>â€¶His parner was a stunning woman. Not as stunning as you are, of course, but still pretty good-looking,â€¶ Chuck said with a wink, â€¶tall, beautiful, probably not even thirty. Long, bark-colored hair. Had a certain assertive charm to her, though she was quite discreet, probably wearing a wig as well.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Wigs would explain why we didn't see him at the cameras. He simply wore a disguise,â€¶ Davis scratched her chin, intrigued so much that she even stopped blushing for a second, â€¶but why?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I think, judging by her manners, she wasn't a commoner either. These two probably decided to keep their relationship a secret, that's why they turned it into a masquerade. Seemed really into each other, too. I'm not doubtful Milran is having the time of his life right now.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Or he got kidnapped by a liar and is now held against his will!â€¶ Leo parried, â€¶who was that witch? What do you remember?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Not much. She wasn't as talkative, actually knew how to maintain secrecy. But she had a British accent, and the two went into one of the villas, so she must've been quite wealthy. Anything else, my naked friend?â€¶  <br><br>â€¶Not at all, my clothed rival. You've already told us what we needed to know.â€¶<br><br>Leo and Davis turned toward each other and simultaneously nodded. Both of them knew what they had to do next. Arnold tried his best to follow their train of thought, even though he had no idea.<br><br>It didn't take long to use the woman's description and match it with the hotel's database of current guests. After all, not that many people could afford to rent a villa in the current economy. The Palace's staff was against sharing the confidential information of their patrons, but Davis managed to convince them that a Sanflarian nobleman could've been kidnapped, and they were required to cooperate with ICA in the name of the law. The captain sounded very convincing, which was quite impressive considering she had to speak with the staff in the nude.<br><br>After some digging, Leo finally saw the face of that wench who stole her cousin. It belonged to Olivia Mcwindsor, a scion of a powerful English house. Along with the name and the looks, they also got the number of her villa, to which the group headed immediately. Arnold took this moment to explain to Leo that nobles didn't have the same amount of power on Earth as on Sanflaria, but the naked countess was still determined to view this as a feud between their houses.<br><br>The stars shone in the night sky as Arnold and Leo approached the luxurious villa, surrounded by the ICA agents. From the green yard filled with tropical plants to the giant swimming pool, the building was silent. Light was only shining in a single room under the roof, suggesting that it wasn't empty. ICA men went first, surrounding the building and blocking off all possible exits.<br><br>They tried making Arnold come with them, but Leo interwined and preffered to keep her trusted hostage nearby. The clerk would never think he'd be so grateful for this treatment. He was still given a gun though, unsure whether to be happy or scared about it.<br><br>Captain Davis opened the front door with a kick and went in along with Leo and Arnold. She firmly held the gun in her hand, trying her best to suppress the goosebumps from the chill winds and the rising anxiety from her both embarassing and dangerous position. The officer still couldn't believe she was entering a possibly deadly hostage situation wearing nothing but a belt! It was similar to the nightmares she'd have before waking up for work. Only this time, everything was even more surreal.<br><br>â€¶Oh God, I hope it's loaded,â€¶ Arnold whispered, awkwardly changing the grip on his gun.<br><br>Davis turned around and shushed the duo, her bare feet silently stepping forward. There wasn't a soul in the spacious rooms, Olivia must've sent her butlers and other staff away for some reason. The road wasn't an easy one, with each creak and each opened door threatening to guve out their locations. It took Arnold all his courage to subdue his fears and try protecting Eleonora, who walked like she owned the villa despite being completely unprotected. Several tense minutes have pasted and the trio was finally at the door, which led to the main bedroom.<br><br>â€¶Alright, let's consider our options and...â€¶ Captain Davis began devising her plan, yet Leo interrupted.<br><br>â€¶That's for my cousin, you criminal scum!â€¶<br><br>A second later, the furious naked woman kicked the door open and charged inside like a commander leading her army into the battle.<br><br>â€¶Leo, s-stop!â€¶ Arnold cried out while Davis followed, gritting her teeth in rage.<br><br>What they saw inside surprised them to no end, even Leo stopped for a second to evaluate the situation. The first thing, or, rather, person they saw was a blonde, slim man in his late twenties. He was in his underwear, gagged and tied to the king-sized canopy bed, moaning and trying to break free of his shackles. The bare parts of his body revealed numerous scratches and bruises, which could've only been done by methodical beating. The place was in dissaray, with clothes and pillows lying all around the floor.<br><br>â€¶You... You were right?â€¶ Arnold and Davis both looked at the countess, their eyes full of surprise.<br><br>â€¶Milran! What have they done to you?!â€¶<br><br>The naked blonde jumped to the bed, but was interrupted by a sudden sound coming from the wardrobe. Milran kept moaning, as if trying to say something, but there was no time to ungag him. Instead, Leo approached the door and assumed her fighting stance, waiting for her enemy to make the first move. Suddenly, it opened and a dominant feminine voice came through:<br><br>â€¶Ha-ha, I hope you're ready, my poor, poor prisoner. Because I haven't even started,â€¶ a figure dressed in black appeared in the doorway, making Leo lung forward for a quick takedown while Davis and Arnold readied their firearms.  <br><br>And then the first shot was fired." },
      { title: "Chapter 10", summary: "Half-naked truth", content: "Arnold flinched as the gunshot pierced his ears, nearly dropping his gun. A beautiful woman with dark, wavy hair stood in the doorway, her face hidden behind the mask. It wasn't the kind of mask the clerk would expect, though, and her outfit overall didn't fit a kidnaper at all. Audrey Mcwindsor was wearing a black leather costume consisting of an immodest top and panties, complemented by a pair of fishnet stockings and garters holding them in place. In one hand, she was holding a long, scary-looking whip, and a gun pointed upwards in the other.<br><br>The clerk and the naked captain looked at Audrey in confusion, thinking that they must've misunderstood what was happening here. However, it was too late to draw conclusions, as Leo already went on the attack. Only a gasp escaped Audrey's mouth when the countess tackled her and pushed her to the ground, brutally bending her arm behind her back and letting the pistol fall on the floor.<br><br>Before Mrs. Mcwindsor could protest, Leo began tearing off the dominatrix costume off her body and stripped her naked in a matter of seconds. Audrey's top turned into a rope with which the blonde tied her hands behind her back, while her panties with a destroyed waistband (which caused the owner plenty of pain) got shoved in her mouth like a gag, making her twitch in disgust.<br><br>â€¶You thought you could torture my dear cousin with no punishment, wench? Let's see how you like the taste of your own medicine!â€¶ Leo shouted, grabbing the whip and focusing her gaze on Audrey's firm butt.<br><br>Mrs. Mcwindsor realized what was happening and began shaking her head, but Leo's revenge has already begun: the strong hand dropped the whip on the poor lady's ass over and over again, leaving red marks on her pale, tender skin as it showered her with strikes. Captain Davis ran up to the two to break them up, her boobs comically jiggling with each step and causing Audrey even more confusion. Arnold decided to ungag Milran, hoping that at least he could shed some light on this chaos.<br><br>â€¶S-stop, please, my blood, don't do it. She is innocent!â€¶ the blonde man cried out.<br><br>Leo turned around and froze, not believing what she was hearing.<br><br>â€¶What? Why? I'm simply avenging you for all the suffering you've endured. Your bruises...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, I have endured plenty of suffering,â€¶ Milran said with an awkward pause, â€¶but, well, you see, they were inflicted voluntarily.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?!â€¶ The blonde approached the bed, looking like she was ready to beat her cousin up herself.<br><br>â€¶Let me explain...â€¶ he said with pleading eyes as Arnold was untying him.<br><br>â€¶You better do so, and quick!â€¶<br><br>Milran let out a sigh, looking over the trio with a hint of shame. Davis felt an odd feeling of relief for a second, at least this man didn't ogle her naked form. Meanwhile, Leo kept staring her cousin down, waiting for an explanation.<br><br>â€¶You see, I met this charming woman on the first day of my stay at this hotel,â€¶ he pointed at naked Audrey, who was still moaning and struggling in her bondage, â€¶it was friendly at first, but then we drank a bit too much wine and... Well, our relationship quickly progressed. She didn't want us to be seen together, however, as it could've been a scandal for both our houses. So we came up with those wigs and different names that would make us disappear from the public eye for at least a couple nights.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Fake names? Like Nilmar?â€¶ Arnold couldn't contain his skepticism.<br><br>â€¶Yes, now that I think about it, that name probably wasn't the best choice, but nevertheless, it worked. We managed to have our time together without anyone from the outside world bothering us. Um, up until I gambled all my money away in that casino and had to take her money to pay for our supper, which she wasn't fond of at all.â€¶<br><br>The trio looked back at Audrey and let out a grunt, which would surely be something more if not for the panties in her mouth.<br><br>â€¶Are you serious?!â€¶ Leo folded her arms and bend over Milran, making her enticing boobs look almost intimidating, â€¶I came all this way, fighting off criminals, interrogating with ICA, and shaking my curves for Earthian perverts, and all this time your only problems were from your own stupidity?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Leo, my blood, please, understand. Their machines are all so shiny, and the slots make such a satisfying click when they spin! I did not expect this, and when I understood what was happening, it was too late. We don't have anything like that on Sanflaria. Don't misunderstand, I love hunting and lightshows, but this kind of thrill is something out of our world... Literally, I suppose.â€¶<br><br>â€¶But how about the message you sent me? About being held in a palace, a place with no exists?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'm very sorry, but you must've misheard. For you Earthians, I'll clarify that I said a phrasal verb that meant I couldn't make myself leave this place, which sounds awfully familiar to it not having an exit in Sanflarian. The money I asked was to pay back Audrey. I'm a gentleman, after all, so I asked you to bring a sum from my savings to cover our expenses after I realized I was way over budget.â€¶<br><br>Arnold looked at Leo and instantly took a step back, seeing how her eye began to twitch and her face was slowly becoming red from anger.<br><br>â€¶I didn't want to inconvenience you, but you're the only one I could tell. Neither my not your parents would understand. Besides, Audrey didn't wanna anyone to know about our little relationship, so she suggested we wait here and keep playing until you send me the money. Uh, you did bring the money, didn't you? I'd like to deal with this before my meeting, so everything could proceed as normal. Leo, why are you silent? Leo?â€¶<br><br>Captain Davis grabbed the hot-headed blonde by the shoulders, ensuring she won't charge at Milran and do all the unthinkable horrors she was afraid his kidnappers were doing.<br><br>â€¶So, you're telling me you came here without even knowing what you're getting into, completely misread what this place was and got yourself into trouble without anyone else to blame?!â€¶<br><br>Suddenly, the blonde stopped and took a step back, her eyes widening from realization. She clearly saw the similarity between this and her rescue mission, started only due to her prejudice toward Earthians, a feeling that was both harmful and unfounded all along.<br><br>â€¶I've got no words. And no, I didn't bring your money, you dimwit, that'll teach you to be more clear next time,â€¶ Leo said, her hands on her shapely hips.<br><br>Davis took this moment to ungag and untie Mrs. Mcwindsor, who began spitting and cursing like she was daughter of a sailor.<br><br>â€¶How dare you? Who do you think you are, dumb whores?! Nobody treats Audrey Mcwindsor like... A-a-a, my ass!â€¶ She screamed as Captain Davis lightly slapped her behind.<br><br>â€¶Apologies, Mrs. Mcwindsor, but we believe this all to be a misunderstanding, which is better to be forgotten. For both parties' sake.â€¶<br><br>The captain gave Audrey a deceptively kind smile, which she met with a grunt, then covered her sim figure and ran back to the wardrobe room. She was angry now, but her threats were completely baseless. After all, to do something she'd need to tell her family, which was not happening.<br><br>â€¶Thanks,â€¶ Milran said to Arnold as the clerk untied him and handed him his clothes.<br><br>â€¶Now let's get you outta here and finally go home!â€¶ Leo exclaimed in anticipation.<br><br>Arnold barely concealed his sadness. While a part of him was glad he'd be returning to the safe life of office plankton, he only now realized how much he'd miss Eleonora. Suddenly, his train of thought was cut short by the static sound from Davis' walkie-talkie.<br><br>â€¶C-captain,â€¶ someone yelled in agitation, â€¶there are strange people gathering around the villa. They're armed. I think we're... We're getting attacked!â€¶<br><br>The sounds of gunshots echoed throughout the room, loud and plentiful. There was a shooting happening outside, and it seemed like this time there were far more attackers than before.<br><br>â€¶Oh right, I nearly forgot about that scum!â€¶ Leo replied, â€¶indeed, Milran, your story does not explain why somebody has been trying to kill me for the entire day!â€¶<br><br>The nobleman shook his head, completely confused by what was happening. At least this part wasn't his fault. The group turned toward the door, hearing footsteps and an odd click followed by complete silence.<br><br>â€¶Get down, everyone!â€¶ Davis commanded as she jumped on Arnold, landing on the bed with him.<br><br>The clerk felt hormones surge as his face got buried into the captain's round, alluring breasts. Davis made sure to focus on the danger, but it was clear she was still embarrassed. A second later, they had another thing to worry about: a deafening shotgun blast went through the room, smashing the window to pieces and destroying a potted plant nearby.<br><br>Davis got up and fired back, forcing the assailant to step back. Her skin got covered with goosebumps when she understood the danger she was in, entering that gunfight completely naked. Still, it was her job, so she valiantly kept holding the shooter back despite her fear and shame.<br><br>â€¶Oh my God, oh my God,â€¶ Arnold kept yelling, having lost his gun and now trying to find it under the king-sized bed.<br><br>â€¶A man is down!â€¶ Voices in the walkie-talkie mixed with shouts and gunfight.<br><br>â€¶You need to get out of here!â€¶ The captain said to the Sanflarians with fear in her eyes, â€¶this is getting out of control.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Alright, Milran. Let's move out,â€¶ Leo said, agreeing that her main task was protecting her younger cousin.<br><br>Milran, now dressed in a contrasting outfit of black pants and a shiny, bronze-coloured coat, gave Eleonora a quick nod and began crouching toward the exit.<br><br>â€¶He's reloading!â€¶ Davis shouted, hearing new clicks outside the door, â€¶it's out chance!â€¶<br><br>The captain moved swift as a lightning, running into the hall with her bare feet nearly tripping on the carpet, and firing several rounds right into the criminal. It looked like he nearly managed to fire back, but got so surprised upon seeing the naked officer that he froze in place, dropping his guard.<br><br>â€¶Look, I told you that nudity is the way to go for us women,â€¶ Leo chuckled, leading Milran into the neighboring room, to which Davis simply rolled her eyes.<br><br>Sanflarians ran to the spacious area consisting of a living room with a semi-attacked hallway, only separated by a half-wall divider. Unfortunately, they didn't notice another criminal in dark clothing, who held a submachine in his hand. Leo managed to tell Milran to duck at the last second, before the rain of bullets piercing the wall and shelves behind them, destroying everything in its path. Leo moved forward with an athletic sommersault while Milran jumped back, owing to his careful nature.<br><br>â€¶Come here, what are you doing? I have to protect you!â€¶ the countess shouted, her voice barely distinguisable due to the gunshots.<br><br>â€¶Don't worry about me, my blood. Save yourself, I'll find my own way out of this trap!â€¶<br><br>â€¶You sure?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I've spent enough time in this villa to know its ins and outs. Even though most of the time I walked on all fours and blindfolded, I...â€¶<br><br>â€¶Alright-alright, too much information,â€¶ Leo shouted back, â€¶just do your thing, I'll be fine.â€¶<br><br>Milran did a gesture meaning â€¶good luckâ€¶ in ancient Sanflarian and crawled out of the room, while Leo set her sights on that pesky shooter.<br><br>Sanflarians didn't use bullets, instead fighting with energy weapons fueled by the solar energy itself. A warrior from Leo's homeland would shoot once, then wait for the weapon to rechange, and repeat. Knowing when the break would come and using it to your advantage was crucial when fighting against firearms with your bare hands, especially when everything else was bare as well. Earthians' weapons were different, but while they could shoot for longer, it seemed like the â€¶reloadingâ€¶ process was longer as well.<br><br>â€¶Come out, come out, little slut,â€¶ the old man spoke in a raspy voice, â€¶I'll make it quick.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, you surely will!â€¶<br><br>Leo knew the only way to make him waste bullets was to provoke him, so she took this dangerous option with a fearless grin. Instead of hiding, the blonde jumped up and began shaking her tits like she was at a party, making sure the old-timer took the bait. Another flurry of bullets flew right at her, and she managed to jump away right in time. Adrenaline surge made Leo move even faster, her limbs trembling from the pressure. It was dangerous, deadly, and completely awesome; the fearless countess was in her element here.<br><br>Another jump, another spray of bullets covering nearby chairs and shelves, breaking glass and shattering wood. It was followed by familiar clicks, letting Leo know that it was time to strike. She got on the chair with one swift move, and before the man could react, she charged at him at all her speed. He attempted to flee, but Leo's leg connected with his ribs with a crack, then her knee broke his nose and made him lose the teeth he still had.<br><br>One was down, but there were surely more to go. Leo looked at the submachine gun and grabbed it with curiosity, only to throw it away like useless garbage a second later. She didn't need anything but her body, and these criminals will soon learn that as well.<br><br>â€¶I think the bitch went that way!â€¶ She heard someone say as she ran into another room.<br><br>It was a spacious relaxation area with a giant fishtank and a self-playing piano in the corner. This sight could've been pleasant under different circumstances, but now it was simply distracting. Thankfully, the next bandit was dumb enough to announce his present with a swear as he entered the room, allowing the blonde time to hide before he opened fire. Each shot pierced Leo's ears like spears but the breaks were longer as well.<br><br>The naked blonde glanced from behind a bookshelf and realized this man was holding a heavy pistol of some sort, easier to dodge but not allowing any mistakes. He was also far more careful, not wasting his bullets and looking to make every shot count. Leo still managed to make him slip by running throughout the room, her voluptuous curves bouncing along and serving as a distraction. The man shot twice, but missed, hitting the giant fishtank and the piano.<br><br>â€¶You cretin!â€¶ Leo said, seeing that the water began pouring out of the tank onto the floor, fishes flopping and thrashing around as they desperately looked for oxygen.<br><br>â€¶How about I show you how it feels, huh?â€¶ With these words, Leo grabbed a nearby vase and threw it right at the man's head.<br><br>Charging at him would've been too dangerous, since she didn't know how many bullets did his gun hold. However, as the bandit got momentarality stunned by the vase, she managed to attack from behind and hit him in the groin at full force, kicking the gun out of his hands. This criminal was bulky and muscular, so he managed to fight back, landing a blow into Leo's stomach. Then he grabbed Leo's mane and managed to hit her head against the table so hard it nearly broke. He aimed to repeat it, but the girl noticed a pen lying in the corner and grabbed it while struggling against his grip.<br><br>â€¶Your oppressive rule is no more, Eleonora!â€¶ the bandit laughted and began shocking the blonde with his free hand.<br><br>In a fit of adrenaline, Leo managed to free her neck for a mere second, but it was enough for her to bite the man's hand and make him scream in pain. As he was distracted, Leo's athletic leg tripped him up, resulting in him falling onto the table and shattering it with his bulky form. Before the criminal could get up, the blonde lunged at him and landed her majestic ass right on his bearded face, making him twitch from the impact. With her hands holding his and her backside making it hard for him to breathe, Leo playfully wriggled atop the criminal as he struggled and tried to free himself from this dangerous yet sexy hold.<br><br>â€¶Oh yeah, faster, faster!â€¶ She mocked his attempts, moaning as if they were making love while the man was passing out from the lack of air.<br><br>Finally, the struggling stopped, the man finally losing his consciousness, nearly suffocated by Leo's alluring butt.<br><br>â€¶Oppressive rule? What?â€¶ Leo blinked in confusion as she got up, still coughing from that scum's grip.<br><br>Then, the sound of leaking water attracted her attention. She forgot about the tank! Forgetting about the main, Leo grabbed another vase and made the water flow right into it. Her next step was caringly picking up all the fish from the floor, letting them survive in this improvised tank.<br><br>â€¶Just wait here, little ones. Your home will be as good as new once we finish with this,â€¶ Leo said and ran to the elevator while gunshots rang out all around the house.<br><br>The next room was a corridor akin to a small labyrinth with Greek imagery covering its marble walls. The countess stopped, listening for footsteps while making sure not to slip on this smooth floor. Somebody was coming, so Leo squatted near a nearby doorway and made sure to prepare. Then, the footsteps' direction suddenly changed, and she turned around to face the enemy. But the enemy was quicker. Before the countess could approach the entrance, a man in his twenties, with dark clothing and a pistol in his hand, emerged from behind the corner and pointed his gun right at her.<br><br>Thoughts raced through her head as she tried to find a place to hide or something to attack with, but there was nothing. She truly caught herself in an unwinnable position. However, this guy seemed far less aggressive than the other two, even smiling at his lucky catch. She could tell he was full of himself, judging by that smug look on his face. Judging by how certain men viewed women in this world, Leo certainly could exploit that.<br><br>â€¶Oh the Many-eyed, help me!â€¶ she said while raising her hands up and dropping on her knees like a submissive during roleplay.<br><br>The criminal whistled and took a step closer.<br><br>â€¶Wow. They said you were a knockout, but this was an understatement!â€¶<br><br>â€¶T-thanks for your kindness,â€¶ Leo dropped even lower, bowing before the man, â€¶please, spare my life! I'm a noblewoman who has never been in any sort of danger, and I cannot do soldiers' work!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yeah, that'd be a shame to kill such a hottie. Our employer didn't pay us that well anyway. How about I let you go, if you let me get to know you a little closer?â€¶<br><br>A barely hidden grin flashed across Leo's face, but she lowered her head and kept pleading, not giving away her plan.<br><br>â€¶S-sure, I'll do everything you want, master!â€¶<br><br>The man was taken aback by the last word, and his breathing became hectic for a second. He approached Leo with a smirk and made her turn around, then began shamelessly groping her beautiful, naked body. The blonde moaned a little as the criminal's hands landed on her boobs and began rubbing her nipples.<br><br>She knew that this was all a trick, but her body surely didn't care. When they started to become hard, the criminal removed his hands and let his fingers travel across her belly, athletic limbs, and even sent them down to her pussy. Leo didn't protest. On the contrary, she even spread her legs a little to make the process easier, selling the lie.<br><br>â€¶Master, c-can I t-touch you too?â€¶ she imitated Arnold's stutter for a bigger effect, making the criminal's cheeks rosy.<br><br>â€¶Sure,â€¶ he kissed her neck with a grin and slowly watched her crawl around on all fours in front of him, like a obedient doggy waiting for her command.<br><br>What he didn't know is that this dog could bite. Right when Leo faced the man and realized they were close, she instantly lunged at him and made him drop his gun by painfully bending his arm backward.<br><br>â€¶What the fuck?! Hey! Stop, no!â€¶ he yelled, trying to free himself.<br><br>â€¶You've got nice, soft hands,â€¶ Leo said after giving him an elbow that made his vision go blurry, â€¶too bad you used them to point guns at innocent people!â€¶<br><br>With these words, she made the criminal get up and drove his head right into the corridor's corner. Blood gushed out of the man's face, leaving a red stain on the marble. He let out a weak cry for help and fell down, twitching in convulsions. Leo dusted off her hands and turned toward the end of the corridor, where she saw an elevator shaft. She was about to press the button, but noticed the cabin was already in use, lowering to this floor.<br><br>Leo took a deep breath, a bit weary from the fighting, but still assumed her fighting stance and stood right in front of the elevator, ready to meet the next foe head-on. Finally, the elevator arrived with a loud ding, and a lone figure, clad in shoes and a dark coat obscuring its entire body, raised its head at the countess.<br><br>Leo didn't wait and jumped into the air, performing a masterful spin kick that sent the criminal flying into the elevator's wall. The blonde continued with an elbow, but the enemy dodged and counterattacked so quickly she barely managed to block. The two began showering each other with hits, both blocking and evading everything thrown at them.<br><br>â€¶What the hell? Who even are you?!â€¶ Leo yelled and grabbed the person's coat while they hit her in the solar plexus so hard she nearly fell down.<br><br>In a quick spin, the two pulled back and increased distance. Leo suddenly realized that she was holding the person's coat and threw it away. It was odd to the touch, like that hypoallergenic cloth Leo once encountered, but why would it be here? When she raised her eyes to see who was standing in front of her, a shocked gasp escaped her mouth.<br><br>â€¶You?! But... How? Why?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, my Kiradorian bestie, I suppose it's time for our rematch,â€¶ the figure said with a smirk.<br><br>It turned out to be a woman, now dressed only in a pair of sneakers. Leo recognized her right away, it was hard not to remember this athletic figure, long dreadlocks with a hint of purple, and a cobra tattoo stretching throughout her entire back.<br><br>â€¶Viparia... It cannot be!â€¶ Leo cried out while her opponent assumed an offensive stance." },
      { title: "Chapter 11", summary: "The Hawk and the Snake", content: "â€¶Sorry,â€¶ Viparia said, confidently stepping on marble with her sneakers, â€¶I didn't know you'd be here. You weren't supposed to learn about this. Until later.â€¶<br><br>The purple-haired girl attacked like a lightning, but Leo managed to dodge and land a kick right into her ribs.<br><br>â€¶So you're the employer! Why?!â€¶ The blonde jumped forward, attempting to immobilize her with a hold, but Viparia countered with a dropkick.<br><br>â€¶I'd love to tell you everything, but I still got other matters to attend to,â€¶ Cobra charged forward once more, forcing Leo to back down with her fierce style.<br><br>The two began exchanging blows once more, but nothing would hit as they swiftly moved around, jumping and rolling around the corridor like energetic dancers. Leo nearly got ahead by landind a couple of elbows and making Viparia stagger, but her bare feet slipped on the smooth marble and made her fall right on her bare ass.<br><br>The blonde ducked by laying down a moment before Viparia could strike her again, then got up without using her arms and continued fighting. But this moment was enough for Cobra to land another devastating blow in her stomach, forcing Leo to back down into the cabin.<br><br>â€¶You're strong. Even Queen of Frogs would drop on the ground after my famous attack,â€¶ Viparia said, raising her eyebrow, â€¶but my mission's too important to lose, so you will too.â€¶<br><br>Before Leo could react, Cobra rushed to the cabin and locked the blonde's hands between her marvelous thighs in a spin, making both of them fall. Leo tussled and turned, but the baroness' grip was sure and firm, making her lose oxygen with each second. Right now she wished she'd get a mission where she wouldn't get chocked twice in an hour, but, once again, her parents taught her to always play with the hand she was dealt. Remembering her family added Leo some courage and she fiercely turned around while biting Cobra's bare leg.<br><br>â€¶A-a-ah, you bitch! They call your family hawks, but you're nothing but worms!â€¶ Viparia managed to kick Leo in the face with her boot before inspecting the bloody mark on her calve.<br><br>â€¶They call us that because we're noble warriors, not traitors like your snake kin is!â€¶ Leo was on the offensive now, landing jabs and kicks on her opponent's naked curves.<br><br>â€¶Cobras aren't traitors, they're just quick and agile!â€¶ the baroness parried and ducked, instantly hitting Leo with an uppercut right into her pussy.<br><br>The countess cried out in pain but didn't lose her balance and responded with an elbow to Viparia's jaw. The two gained distance and continued fighting in the cabin, their soft breasts and taut butts bouncing all around in this hot, dangerous action. At some point, one of them hit a button, so the cabin began ascending to the villa's roof.<br><br>Viparia nearly caught Leo while she got distracted, but the blonde evaded, and Cobra drove her elbow right into the wall, pressing the emergency button. A voice of a technician came through the static while the naked fighters kept showering each other with blows.<br><br>â€¶Hello, what's your emergency? Let me turn on the camera... Oh, wow!â€¶ a male voice spoke in delight, â€¶Tim, come here! Tim! There's two naked chicks in the elevator, putting on an MMA show or something. Holy shit, those rich people know how to have fun!â€¶<br><br>The girls disregarded their horny audience and focused on fighting, dropping each other's naked bodies on the floor and trying their best to catch their opponent into a hold. The cabin was quite tight, so soon they stopped jumping and began to wrestle. Tussling and turning, the two grabbed each other's limbs and constantly switched positions, assuming all kinds of indecent poses along the way. Their breasts, pussies, and butts rubbed against each other while their sweat mixed into one hot liquid. One hold followed the other, interrupted by strikes and groans of the struggling women.<br><br>At one point, Viparia managed to lift Leo on her shoulders and hold her in a backbreaker, also grubbing her pussy and nipples with her sharp nails. However, instead of screaming or pleading for help, the blonde methodically switched positions and managed to land on her feet, turning this into her own hold. Another spin, and Viparia was already lying on the floor with Leo's vulva covering her face and denying her air.<br><br>â€¶Remember? That's how I won the last time, you pathetic wench!â€¶ The blonde said, wriggling around while Viparia's moaning pleasantly vibrated on her vulva.<br><br>â€¶Once I'm done with you, you'll tell me everything about your treacherous plan. Or your house's plan, for that matter. I know you'd never do this without your elders' consent.â€¶<br><br>It turned out, Cobra learned from last time: with the swiftness of a cheetah, she used her legs to get up and make Leo fall, then grabbed her arms from behind and pulled them backward, driving her knee into the blonde's back. Before that, however, she took a second to smash the emergency receiver, making sure the technicians wouldn't hear her next words.<br><br>â€¶You won't live to hear my tale, birdie! It's nice to see you here, truly. I originally planned to kill Milran, but now it's like a two-for-one sale! Your house will never recover from this loss, and soon we will rule over the entire Kir'ador.â€¶<br><br>â€¶So that's what it is, huh? A simple lust for power?â€¶ Leo spoke through pain, â€¶you morons. My death will only make our people unite around my father! The Liege of Kir'ador will become stronger than ever.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Is that so? I'm sure other counts will think differently when they learn your house failed to establish a proper contact with Earth. And your daddy will be too focused on his upcoming conflict with Earthians to notice!â€¶<br><br>Those last words infuriated Eleonora to no end. Not only was Viparia plotting to kill Milran, she also wanted to frame the entire Earth for this crime! Not rage, but hatred began brewing inside of her, and she only needed one opportunity to use it. Finally, the elevator came to the roof with a loud ding.<br><br>Cobra looked at the opening to make sure there were no ICA agents, and at that second, Leo freed herself through sheer force of will and landed the most devastating punch yet. Before Viparia could even react, she was hit with a kick, then another, and one more, until she lied flat on the roof's floor, between the decorative bushes and folding chairs.<br><br>Leo took a step out of the cabin and felt a moment of nostalgia: this little vacation spot reminded her of roof gardens in her beloved Sanflaria and made this fight seem even more tragic.<br><br>â€¶Seriously?â€¶ she finally asked, â€¶you'd ruin our relations with an entire world for your pathetic lust for power? What a disgrace!â€¶<br><br>â€¶You've already disgraced your house by holding negotiations with these primitives,â€¶ Viparia retorted, standing up. â€¶Just look around! Do you truly think something good can come out of this world? They're destroying their own planet by burning harmful fuels, fill their oceans with garbage, and stash weapons that could turn their civilization into dust! You can see their filthy nature in everything they do... I even had to wear clothes just so their men wouldn't gawk at me like a bunch of monkeys. Our people have never been supposed to trust them, and after today, they won't.â€¶<br><br>Leo stood silent for a moment, her head consumed by a whirwild of thoughts and feelings she could barely articulate. These words sounded so much like her own, and there seemed to be so much truth in them. However, one phrase finally came through the storm, clear and light as day.<br><br>â€¶No,â€¶ the countess replied, â€¶you're wrong. They might have their problems, but we do as well. There are many good people here, those worthy of trust and respect. I've seen them myself.â€¶<br><br>Viparia's face was filled with skepticism, to which Leo smiled and added:<br><br>â€¶Yes, most of them treated me well, despite me not bowing down to their culture by covering my body, like someone else did...â€¶<br><br>This phrase enraged Cobra, and she charged right at the blonde, to which she simply rolled away and nearly made the attacked crash into the stack of folding chairs. Leo was about to attack, but suddenly another criminal emerged from the elevator, so she had to deal with him.<br><br>His first bullet nearly found its target, but Leo managed to dodge and jumped right at the man, disorienting him with the marvelous sight of her naked breasts.<br><br>A quick leg sweep made him fall, and a precise strike to the head finished the job. Leo expected Cobra to attack from behind, but instead she lunged at somebody else... An ICA agent who came to check whether there were more shooters on the roof.<br><br>â€¶Stop, she's not an ally!â€¶ Leo yelled at the man who looked at Viparia in confusion.<br><br>Before he could raise his gun, Cobra kicked him in the gut and sent him into an empty swimming pool, breaking several of his bones.<br><br>â€¶Looks like we'll have to fight one-on-one!â€¶ the countess concluded, already short of breath.<br><br>â€¶Just how I like it,â€¶ Cobra replied, running toward her foe like a bull.<br><br>The two clashed once again like two raging currents, giving their all to this dangerous yet sexy combat. Leo made sure to dodge Cobra's famed jabs, afraid to lose her balance if she gets hit once more. Their windstriking styles were similar yet different in how they approached offense, with Eleonora preferring more direct and quick hits and Cobra using an elaborate tactic of waiting and baiting.<br><br>It was a battle of attrition, which led them right to the staircase leading back to the villa's living room. They fought right next to it, both breathless and tired, yet ready to throw each other down the stairs and come out on top, both figuratively and literally. In a swift exchange, Leo managed to catch her opponent's leg and hit it against a railing. Viparia lost her footing, and the countess started twisting her ankle, enjoying her deafening screams of pain.<br><br>â€¶Give up now or you'll never kick anyone again, Cobra!â€¶ Leo proclaimed while the baroness was writhing on the floor.<br><br>â€¶Let it be, but I'll also never bow to your pathetic house again!â€¶<br><br>Suddenly, Viparia spun and hit Leo in the ribs with her free leg and seized the initiative. Before Leo knew it, she was laying in front of the stairs face down with her opponent laughing above.<br><br>â€¶Finally, this rivarly is settled. Now both of us know whose style is better,â€¶ Cobra prepared for her last bite that would finish the blonde countess off for good.<br><br>However, Leo wasn't done and suddenly sat up in front of her. An act of pure defiance, even though it was a vulnerable position, exposed to any strike. It seemed like this enraged Viparia, who took this as an insult, so she spun once more and got ready to deliver the most gracious kick she was capable of.<br><br>The blonde moved a little, but it was still easy to catch her, in a moment her nose will be broken and her teeth will be flying all over the roof... At least that's what Viparia thought when she suddenly lost her footing and fell right into Leo's next strike.<br><br>â€¶W-what?!â€¶ She said, now facing the long, sturdy stares.<br><br>â€¶It's truly settled, and it seemed like my style has won. Maybe because I respect the art enough to not wear shoes!â€¶<br><br>Viparia looked at her sneakers in horror, their shoelaces tangled and hanging from the shoes. Leo must've untied them during that ankle lock, but when the baroness realized that, she felt a sudden smack on her eyes and went flying through the entire staircase, hitting all parts of her tender body in the process. Leo quickly followed, sitting on the railing with her naked ass and sliding down like it was a carnival ride. There, she landed the final blow that made Viparia pass out with a long, exasperated groan.<br><br>The adrenaline went back down, and Leo got down on one knee, trying her best to regain her breathing while a storm raced inside her head. This journey, all this danger, the betrayal of one of her closest friends--it all seemed like a hectic daytime dream, and she could only believe it was real due to bruised, naked Viparia lying in front of her. When she heard Arnold shout at her, she didn't even register it at first.<br><br>The clerk pointed at something behind her back, and, turning around, the blonde caught a glimpse of someone. It was one of the criminals lying in the elevator cabin that came back while the naked amazons were fighting. He was beaten and couldn't get up but still held his pistol, aiming it right at Leo's exposed, bare flesh.<br><br>â€¶Look out!â€¶ Arnold pulled the trigger with a yell.<br><br>The first gunshot echoed throughout the whole floor, but the bullet didn't hit the mark and instead got stuck in the elevator's doorway. The second flew right above the man's head and hit the cabin itself. The third went even upper and into the already damaged emergency receiver. Arnold kept trying to shoot the hitman, but the gun only reacted with clicks. It was out of ammo.<br><br>â€¶Loserâ€¶, the man said with a cough.<br><br>Nobody could blame the clerk for this blunder, as the target was quite far away and this was Arnold's first shooting experience. Still, he swore and threw the gun itself in pure desperation. Surprisingly, it hit the man on the head, but it only made him angrier.<br><br>Leo attempted a dash but realized she strained a leg and dropped back down. There was only a split second to react. A choice that could've determined the fate of both nations, a moment to finally take initiative... And Arnold took it.<br><br>â€¶G-get down!â€¶ He stuttered one last time and jumped right on top of Leo, feeling his face get buried between her soft, alluring breasts.<br><br>The feeling was amazing, but it only lasted for a second, after which he felt a sharp pain in his back.<br><br>â€¶Arnold!!!â€¶ Leo hugged the clerk tightly as another gunshot rang out from the cabin.<br><br>The clerk's body became soft in her arms after he let out a gasp, blood gushing out from the fresh wound.<br><br>â€¶Damn, I really need to aim better!â€¶ the hitman gathered all of his strength and raised his torso with his free hand, but didn't manage to make another shot.<br><br>A figure appeared in the doorway, a tall and threatening one. Before the hitman could react, a bullet was sent right into his skull and ended the shooting. Leo looked up at her savior: it was Davis. Her cheeks were burning red, her breathing was hectic, and her nipples were hard thanks to the chilly wind. She stood in the doorway, still completely naked safe for her belt, yet with confidence and a steel gaze that could've sent hordes of such lowlife scum running. This was amazing, but no less amazing than Arnold's unexpected sacrifice.<br><br>â€¶He's hurt, we gotta do something, quick!â€¶ Leo said softly yet firmly, holding the wounded clerk in her warm embrace.<br><br>â€¶Damn scum!â€¶ the captain ran up to the two and pulled out her walkie-talkie.<br><br>â€¶Ella? Is that you?â€¶ Arnold spoke in delirium, â€¶I waited until you'd arrive, for our... Our adventure.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Of course it's me, your Ella,â€¶ Leo said in a soothing tone, â€¶just hang in there, alright? Here, touch my breasts! And remember, it'll be rude to refuse.â€¶<br><br>â€¶S-sure, I'd love to,â€¶ the man spoke quietly, landing his hand on one of Leo's tits and groping it with a smile.<br><br>â€¶An odd method to keep someone from passing out, but if it works...â€¶ Davis' cheeks got even rosier as she sat beside them, letting Arnold use his second hand to rub her boobs as well.<br><br>â€¶Oh yeah, I must be in heaven,â€¶ he continued, barely holding on to his consciousness.<br><br>Leo couldn't help but smirk as she kept reassuring Arnold. Not just because of Davis hiding her embarrassed eyes behind her walkie-talkie, although this was quite funny as well. The countess just couldn't believe that she was sitting here, after a fight, surrounded by two Earthians whom he could call her trusted allies. And beside her was a fellow Sanflarian female, one from her own Kir'ador, who turned out to be an enemy. At least now she could breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that the surprises were finally over.<br><br>***<br><br>When Arnold came to his senses, he was already in an ambulance with Leo holding his hand close by.<br><br>â€¶Finally!â€¶ the countess exclaimed. â€¶I already began thinking that this lady wasn't a true doctor, and I should rid her of this white robe of hers.â€¶<br><br>The middle-aged woman with dark hair sat a bit farther from the blonde with a scoff, keeping up her professional attitude the best she could.<br><br>â€¶Damn, that was an adventure and a half. I-I take it you saved us at the end?â€¶ the clerk asked quietly, to which Leo shushed him, reminding him that he still had to regain his strength.<br><br>â€¶No, silly, you did. And it was quite heroic!â€¶ Leo said, looking at Arnold with a gaze he's never gotten from her before.<br><br>â€¶R-really? No, wait, I recall shooting at that guy, and I missed, didn't I? Damnit, I knew it!â€¶ he raised her voice before the pains caused him to lower it again, â€¶both of us nearly died because of me. I shouldn't have come here, it was a bad idea all along. Ouch!â€¶<br><br>Leo looked at the doctor working on Arnold's wound, and she quickly apologized, scared of being stripped of both her position and everything she was wearing.<br><br>â€¶Oh, stop it,â€¶ Leo's voice turned sweet and soothing again, â€¶you didn't know how to use these bullet lasers of yours, but you still managed to do something. That's what accepting the fight means, Arnold, so it was a success in my book.â€¶<br><br>â€¶R-really?â€¶ Arnold's eyes widened in surprise, â€¶so, uh, I'm kinda your savior, right?â€¶<br><br>The countess rolled her eyes a little but then nodded with a bright smile, as if giving in to a demanding kid.<br><br>â€¶Wanna go on a date after I'm out of the hospital?â€¶ the clerk asked with a smug look on his face that looked like he burrowed it from someone else.<br><br>â€¶Let's keep it at one brave act at a time,â€¶ Leo responded with a chuckle and suddenly embraced the clerk in a warm, pleasant hug.<br><br>He tried his best to keep calm and not scream, mainly because the naked girl accidentally touched his wound while holding him. The two said their goodbyes since the clerk had to be taken into the hospital and Leo still had other matters to deal with. She rubbed her leg as she jumped out of the ambulance and waved her new friend a passionate air kiss. Surprisingly, Leo could walk alright; the muscles only took a minute of Milran's massage to stop acting out. Her cousin knew how to use his hands for sure. Too bad this ability didn't affect playing slots and blackjack.<br><br>A small crowd has gathered outside of the villa. ICA backup, regular cops, the hotel's management, and all kinds of other authorities directed a rain of questions as a lone figure. That figure was Captain Davis, still naked and blushing but retaining her professionalism the way few women could in such circumstances. Leo could tell it took the officer all of her courage to just stand here and explain everything. The process was made harder by the fact that she often had to repeat herself since the surrounding men were often too busy ogling her majestic tits and pussy to listen.<br><br>Still, she had bigger concerns to worry about. Two ICA agents were lost today, and two more were injured. The hitmen, who turned out to be members of a drug cartel, were led away in handcuffs. Those who survived, anyway. Apparently, they were contacted by Viparia's father, who offered them to kill Milran and then Eleonora for the promise of a hallucinogenic Sanflarian plant that could've made their profits skyrocket. Cobra herself was also led to a car, albeit by ICA agents who had to prepare her for an extradition to her homeland. They kept Viparia naked, preserving her dignity as a Sanflarian woman, even though Leo felt like there was no dignity left to speak of.<br><br>â€¶I suppose I can move back to my suite, sorry for the inconviences, Audrey!â€¶ Milran emerged from the villa with his black wig.<br><br>â€¶Hey, you still haven't paid the supper bill!â€¶ the British woman, now clad in a bathrobe, said with a frown.<br><br>â€¶She's right. And judging by your calculations on that piece of paper, we still owe this place a hefty sum!â€¶<br><br>A manager in a beige suit heard the conversation and ran up to the Sanflarians to reassure them.<br><br>â€¶Please, don't worry. For the sake of strengthening the ties between our nations, ICA said they'll take care of all your expenses.â€¶<br><br>Milran looked at Leo with a happy look in his naÃ¯ve eyes, but the countess wasn't so quick to accept this gift. After everything that happened, starting from the moment when she stepped out of the portal and ending with the glorious battle at Caesar's Palace, she didn't feel like Earthians owed her anything anymore. Sure, some of them tried to kill her, but her own fellow citizens did the same.<br><br>On the other hand, many locals were very friendly to them, helping out however they could and even going along with Leo's cultural customs to make her feel comfortable. Now, she felt like it was her turn to pay back for this kindness, and she told this to the manager with a grateful voice that was so unlike her mere hours prior. The manager got a bit confused at first, unsure of how Leo wanted to thank Earth for its hospitality.<br><br>â€¶I think I have an idea,â€¶ she said with a giggle, remembering how big of an effect her naked body had on spectators during the road. â€¶Take it as a gesture of goodwill from my house, it'll be one to remember!â€¶<br><br>At the end of this mysterious phrase, she playfully shook her tits and bit her lip, intriguing the men around her even more." },
      { title: "Chapter 12", summary: "La Desnuda", content: "The Omnia nightclub at Caesar's Palace was a sprawling place of luxury, with crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and a bar lined with gold-leaf mirrors reflecting the glittering lights. Its walls were decorated with murals depicting ancient mythical creatures, and the spacious dance floor was set beneath a shimmering domed ceiling. Patrons poured here in hordes after the sun went down and night finally took over.<br><br>Some were discouraged by the news of a gunfight at one of the villas last night, but most were still determined to get the most out of their stay, especially after learning that there was some kind of surprise guest eager to entertain them tonight. Music and strobing lights created an electric atmosphere that was felt all throughout the venue, and Leo planned to make all of this even better tonight.<br><br>She looked at the vibrant club from above, standing in a staff-only room below the ceiling. Her majestic, naked figure stood out from the formally dressed employees around her, but, as always, she didn't feel any shame, proudly landing her hands on her hips and showcasing her figure to everyone around her. There weren't spectators right now, but that was about to change. The head of the staff, an old man named Francis, slowly walked Leo through the details of her upcoming performance while others handed her a sturdy rope, needed to keep her safe while she'll be soaring above the patrons' heads.<br><br>â€¶I got it, no need to tell me twice. This isn't the hardest thing I've done, you know,â€¶ she chuckled, recalling last night.<br><br>â€¶We still have to make sure,â€¶ Francis said, â€¶having a Sanflarian countess fall to her death in our club won't be the publicity.â€¶<br><br>A couple employees approached her with a waist with two other ropes attached to it, but Leo stopped them with a gesture.<br><br>â€¶No thanks, I'll be fine with this one,â€¶ she confidently tugged the rope in her hands.<br><br>â€¶But that is not safe. All of our aerial performers must wear this belay system to prevent accidents.â€¶<br><br>â€¶All except for this one, nothing should cover this body!â€¶ Leo smacked her naked butt, causing Francis to sigh.<br><br>He probably thought about whether he had lived and earned enough, but ultimately, there was nothing he could do. This Sanflarian was a real adrenaline junkie, he thought, but at least it would make her show even more impressive. The man could only hope that the impression would remain positive throughout.<br><br>â€¶Good luck. I shall be rooting for you,â€¶ said Milran, giving his dear cousin a hug.<br><br>â€¶Of course you will. The money I'll raise will go straight into your pocket!â€¶ she replied, sticking out her tongue.<br><br>Milran laughed along, happy to have such a kind and understanding cousin who would never abandon him in trouble. He didn't think it was a good idea at first. After all, performing acrobatics after such a brutal fight seemed like a recipe for disaster. However, it only took some more massage and a double dose of Sanflarian healing salves to bring Leo back to 100 percent. At least she felt like it, and, judging by what this woman was capable of, Milran didn't question her words.<br><br>â€¶And now, the surprise all of you have been waiting for!â€¶ the DJ spoke into his microphone, the voice echoed throughout the whole dome loudly and clearly, â€¶prepare to witness an unforgettable one-time solo performance of a Sanflarian noblewoman, who crossed the boundaries of our universe to see all of you tonight. Give it all for Eleonora!â€¶<br><br>Omnia erupted in applause while the patrons looked above them. Leo felt Milran's hand firmly giving her a buttslap for good luck and reacted with a playful kick. It was time to start the show. After the last but not the least boring talk with Francis, Eleonora of Kir'ador stepped onto the platform and waved to the audience, spotlights engulfing her body. There was at least a thousand people down there, all ogling Leo's nudity with cheers and woos. She had to admit, this wasn't something she could get in Sanflaria.<br><br>Leo stood like that for a moment, breathing in the attention that washed over her like a wave of pure joy. Finally, she took her bare foot from the platform and enveloped it around the rope. A technician gestured at her with concern, asking whether she wanted to do this one more time, and Leo reacted with a confident nod. Then she took off another foot and let herself fly. The rope led the naked countess forward through the lights and the cheering while she held onto it like a dedicated stripper to her pole.<br><br>â€¶Yes, Sanflarian women are truly one of a kind!â€¶ DJ spoke again, changing the tune.<br><br>Leo recognized this high-energy theme. It was composed in Kir'ador, a pleasant surprise for the naked performer. This made her even more enthusiastic and soon began affecting her moves.<br><br>At first, the countess simply let the rope carry her around and let the crowd get a nice look at her naked backside. However, she couldn't make this the whole show, even if she was the most beautiful woman these people ever saw. After a minute, Leo began bending her back, leaning and spinning around her lifeline like a stripper on a pole. As the excitement rose, so did her boldness, and soon she began performing marvelous tricks that made Francis go pale.<br><br>It started with Leo taking one leg off the rope and letting it hang in the air, then removing her hand and waving to her audience while her curves bounced from the rope's circular movement. At the next moment, she placed another foot on the rope and stood upright, proudly showing off her bare front. DJ kept tossing out comments about her skills and figure. These were polite at first, but soon the man abandoned all shame and made vulgar compliments that would make most women slap him. However, Leo simply laughed and accepted his appreciation, seeing how much he enjoyed himself.<br><br>After a couple more circles, the rope began lowering, and Leo had another idea. She stood up once more, but suddenly threw a scared gaze at the crowd and let go with the remaining hand. The men and women alike gasped at what they thought was a deadly sight, only for Leo to quickly envelop her second leg around the lifeline and hang upside down, blowing air kisses to her lovely audience. Cheering echoed through the building once again, the countess smiled and made this move even better by shaking her breasts to the music's beat.<br><br>The naked performer couldn't resist singing along. Feeling euphoric, Leo brought out her entire arsenal: she jiggled both her breasts and backside right in the people's faces, spread her long legs to show off her shaven pussy, bent in different directions, and assumed all kinds of poses to let everyone ogle her figure in all of its glory, basked in the colorful lights. The technicians saw how much fun the girl was having and decided to add a bit more, lowering her rope so much she was now flying right above people's heads.<br><br>â€¶Ha, got you!â€¶ one of the patrons reached out for her foot, yet she removed it before he could grab her.<br><br>The others soon followed, making a naughty competition of who could touch the countess first. Leo, happy about her performance, played along and let her feet go down so low that she could almost step on the patrons' heads. But no one caught her, the blonde was simply too good at dodging.<br><br>As the rope went even lower, she held onto it tightly and spread both her legs as wide as she could, performing a stunning split in mid-air. This made it harder for the audience to reach Leo's tender feet, so they opted to try slapping her backside instead. Several folks eventually managed to do it, but only because the girl went easy on them for the sake of the show.<br><br>She did one more circle than span across the entire club, dancing in the air like a fairy and sometimes landing her feet on the tables and decorations. As the rope brought the girl back where she started, it suddenly carried her upwards, with the crowd's applause and camera flashes following her shapely figure to the platform. The DJ shouted his thanks into the microphone, saying that this performance was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that nobody here would forget. Judging by the faces of the patrons, especially the male ones, he spoke for pretty much all of them.<br><br>â€¶Thanks, Earthians, you are great tonight!â€¶ she clapped her hands, making sure they knew how much she appreciated this moment of interworld unity.<br><br>When Leo's bare feet touched the cold floor of the staff-only area, she breathed a sigh of relief. She enjoyed performing a lot (maybe even a tad too much, judging by her goosebumps and hard nipples), yet even an action girl like her couldn't perform these athletic fits all night. The staff congratulated the brave countess, eager to learn how much money they'll make from this potentially viral story. Even Francis, who previously sat in a chair clenching his heart, got up and shook Leo's hand.<br><br>â€¶That's our Leo!â€¶ Milran shook the girl by her shoulders, surprisingly causing her more motion sickness than the entire aerial dance did<br><br>â€¶They truly enjoyed your company. I can see why,â€¶ Francis added, his gaze slowly traveling across the naked girl<br><br>â€¶Alright-alright, stop, you'll spoil me with your praise!â€¶ Leo bowed dramatically, then turned around and bowed again, jokingly showing off her ass to the staff<br><br>She added that she needed a quick shower, and Francis could see why. Leo's body was hot and glistened with sweat, which didn't look half bad but wasn't comfortable either<br><br>â€¶Sure,â€¶ he said, â€¶I understand. Even though it's sad to see you leave us so soon.<br><br>There was a confused look on Leo's face, which made Francis doubt his words<br><br>â€¶Who said anything about leaving?â€¶ the countess replied with a cocky grin. â€¶I just need a little break. This party's only getting started!<br><br>Francis couldn't help but smile, realizing that the benefits from Leo's shameless shenanigans far outweighed any possible dangers.<br><br>***<br><br>Omnia's guests kept drinking the night away, some partying on the dance floor while others sat at their tables and waited for the nearby cute waitress to notice them. Many of them talked about the beautiful naked performer, their voices battling with the club's sound system. The reactions ranged from pure amazement to skepticism about her truly being Sanflarian and not just a gimmick.<br><br>However, soon the skeptics got a chance to ask the girl herself: to the surprise of the crowd, Leo soon emerged in the lounge area with a tray and a couple bottles, ready to serve drinks to the club's patrons. People turned their heads one by one, some continuing their applause, others being surprised that a Sanflarian countess would agree to serve as a waitress.<br><br>â€¶Not a very noble thing to do,â€¶ one man jokingly said, his eyes locked on Leo's wiggling backside.<br><br>However, Leo felt no shame about this position; one could even say she was proud.<br><br>â€¶You would think that, but tonight it's all a part of the celebration!â€¶ she exclaimed so loudly a couple of girls flinched. â€¶besides, my dear mother taught me that sometimes it's necessary to level with the common and feel yourself in their shoes... Or lack thereof. You cannot rule over people you can't see.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, baby, you can rule me all you want if you bring me some of that wine,â€¶ the guy replied, feeling proud of his flirting.<br><br>Several tuxedo-clad men agreed, throwing hungry looks at the countess. She didn't need them to say it, feeling in control as soon as her bare feet stepped onto the lounge's soft carpet. It looked like apart from saving her cousin and busting a conspiracy against her house, she also found the most efficient way of recruiting Earthian subjects.<br><br>â€¶Alright, so who wants me to take their order?â€¶ Leo asked and quickly started choosing from the rising hands.<br><br>She walked to each table with no rush at all, her hips swaying in a hypnotizing motion. Nobody complained about their new waitress' speed. After all, it gave them plenty of time to enjoy her looks up close, catching all of the details they missed during her show. They turned around their heads and let out whistles as the countess' voluptuous figure passed by, while she caught each one with a playful smirk.<br><br>It got even better when Leo started filling up the patrons' glasses, bending near their tables with her boobs inches from the wealthy men's faces while spreading her legs and raising her butt for the nearby tables to gawk at. A win-win situation for everyone! All of the compliments, cracks, and other comments they gave her could've felt overwhelming even for Sanflarian females, but Leo simply took them as a sign of their joy, jesting back or playfully parrying their advances.<br><br>â€¶Why does a hottie like you have to leave our world? I live in a very nice mansion not far from here, we could've spent a great night together,â€¶ one of the suit-clad gentlemen couldn't bear it anymore and asked directly.<br><br>Leo stopped for a second, as if considering her options and giving the man a glimpse of hope.<br><br>â€¶Not bad for a beginner, honey. Call me when you buy a castle,â€¶ she replied, causing the nearby tables to giggle.<br><br>As Leo kept strolling around the club, she realized the crowd became more plentiful as the time went on, as well as the amount of groping and reactions she got. The blonde didn't even seem to care and walked right through the most crowded areas, letting everyone know that her female beauty was not to be ashamed of.<br><br>The majority agreed, even pulling out their phones and cameras to take pictures. Too bad Arnold couldn't see her right now, but Leo will make sure to send him photos personally. On the other hand, she was surprised to see Francis coming down to the loundge as well with a professional camera. He claimed it was for â€¶PR purposesâ€¶, but his enticed grin was a dead giveaway.<br><br>There was some posing, plenty of camera clicks, and even more tips, which turned out to be a fun story of their own as the patrons weren't sure where Leo would put them. One of the guys took this as an excuse to slap Leo's hips a couple times, making sure she couldn't put the money into her pocket, while the other pulled out his card and gently slid it between the girl's pussylips, asking whether she accepted credit. <br><br>â€¶Hey, no plastic accepted here!â€¶ Leo touched her vulva and rolled her eyes in a jest, causing even more laughs throughout the crowd.<br><br>A group of wealthy bankers risked giving her some greenbacks and saw a very creative way of carrying them: when Leo turned around, the money was in-between her wiggling buttcheeks, held in place by her strong muscles. This prompted the surrounding patrons to give Leo even more money, which quickly turned into an excuse for them to touch her bottom as much as they wished. This wasn't left unnoticed by Leo, who began provoking the men further by jiggling her butt while accepting money or bumping some patrons with it, causing naughty, sometimes awkward smiles.<br><br>â€¶Hey, that rear of yours looks tired,â€¶ one of the same bankers said, giving the countess a nice-sounding buttslap. â€¶Say, why don't you come sit with us while there are no orders?â€¶<br><br>The countess looked back at Francis, who didn't seem to protest at all. So, after emptying yet another bottle of fine vintage, she put her tips away and went to sit with the arrogant fat cats. Suddenly, it turned out there wasn't enough free space. Leo called this trick right away, but simply rolled her eyes and sat on the nearest guy's lap anyway, enveloping her arm around his neck and allowing him to freely caress her naked figure.<br><br>â€¶How refreshing it is to see a beautiful, confident woman,â€¶ the richman said, â€¶I'm Roy, by the way, nice to meet you.â€¶<br><br>â€¶A pretty bold move,â€¶ one of the girls from a nearby table said, once again surprised at Leo's shameless behavior.<br><br>â€¶Greetings, Roy. Indeed, I don't see what I should be shy about,â€¶ the blonde grinned, â€¶there's nothing scary about joining a nice company for a fine drink and some scrumptious food.â€¶<br><br>â€¶True, absolutely nothing scary about a friendly company,â€¶ Roy said, landing his hand on Leo's breast and squeezing it a little to show how serious he was.<br><br>â€¶Yes, and if this company gets a bit too rowdy, I know how to turn the mood back to friendly again.â€¶<br><br>With these words, Leo gripped Roy's neck a bit tighter, making sure there was no pain but that he could feel her strength. This immediately stopped the banker from having any wrong ideas while his buddies laughed at the Sanflarian's attitude. The man realized he didn't understand what he signed up for, decided to play it safe, and offered Leo a drink while removing his hand from her alluring melon.<br><br>â€¶Oh, come on, I didn't mean it like that,â€¶ the blonde said, gently grabbing the man's hand and putting it right back on her breast.<br><br>There was some jesting back and forth and then clinging of glasses, Leo now joining into the men's recreation.<br><br>â€¶So, what do you folks do for a living?â€¶ Leo asked after tasting the wine.<br><br>â€¶We deal with money, and people need it, that's all. I'm sure your life is much more interesting. What do you do?â€¶ Roy asked back.<br><br>â€¶Quite a lot, actually. Being a noblewoman is not that easy. Makes this night look like a hobby.â€¶ <br><br>The men chuckled once more, already tipsy from the fancy wines they ordered. Nevertheless, the talk went fine, with Leo managing to learn a lot about these men's wealth and social status, mostly thanks to the alcohol they drank. However, it left an odd aftertaste in the countess' mouth. She had time to learn that while there was no nobility in the majority of the Earthian countries, there were still people in power, and their role was often decided solely by wealth and success.<br><br>Naturally, it seemed that such people would view life somewhat similarly to Leo's family. But as she talked with them, she realized it was far from the truth, and her first negatives assumptions were somewhat correct. All the bankers talked about was the fun and joy they got from spending their money, but very little about responsibilities and what good they brought to the world.<br><br>Work comes before the reward, Leo's father often said, making sure she knew that this phrase didn't only concern farmers and laborers. However, it didn't seem like those richmen shared this philosophy, and soon she found them quite boring despite their hospitality. Well, at least their taste in food and vintage was decent, though she'd still prefer the famed purplehill wine of her homeland.<br><br>â€¶I think I have to go. I'm a modest woman who cares not to overdo it with alcohol,â€¶ Leo said politely when she stood up.<br><br>Several patrons laughed at Leo's suggestion that she was modest, but the countess was a woman of her word and still refused further intoxication. Even after Roy offered her the best drinks they could afford, which meant the best drinks Omnia was selling. To compensate a little, Leo gave each of the bankers a hug and allowed them to sent her on her way with some buttslaps, to which they eagerly agreed. After some groping and indecent compliments, Leo was on her way out of the lounge, basking in the cameras' lights like a Hollywood star.<br><br>â€¶Finally,â€¶ the countess heard a female voice say right as she walked back to the bar.<br><br>When Leo turned her head, she saw a busty waitress in a leopard dress looking at her with scorn. She was a leggy redhead with a good-looking body, too bad her sour expression didn't fit that nice look at all.<br><br>â€¶Any problems?â€¶ the blonde asked with her hand on her hip, still posing for the nearby patrons.<br><br>â€¶Well, not for me at least,â€¶ the redhead humphed, â€¶I just don't understand what's in it for you.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What's for me in what?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Degrading yourself!â€¶ she finally exploded, as if stunned by Leo not understanding her point, â€¶I get your weird culture makes you walk around naked all the time, but serving drinks, letting them touch and smack you like that? Don't you have any self-respect?â€¶<br><br>Well, that was new. Even though Leo noticed angry, jealous stares in the eyes of some females, this one was the first to be so direct. Her attempts to be a voice of reason were still in vain, as Leo was far too confident in her lifestyle to be swayed by this shallow criticism.<br><br>â€¶There's nothing degrading in showcasing your beauty to the world. Perhaps you'd benefit from looking at this from my point of view as well,â€¶ she said with calm dominance.<br><br>â€¶Thanks, but I don't need to act like a whore just to get some tips,â€¶ the girl said as she walked away with a bottle, throwing a poisonous gaze at Leo's marvelous figure.<br><br>What a bitch. Even though Leo had a change of heart regarding Earthians, she still wasn't going to let that slide. Whore? Weird culture? That redhead was a bit too stuck up, and the countess knew just the way to change her perspective. After the girl left Leo's line of sight, she ran back to the bankers and whispered something in Roy's ear. He seemed surprised at first, but then a wide grin appeared on his face, and he said they'd gladly do what she asked.<br><br>â€¶Eleonora says that there's a waitress who really wants to put on a show just like her,â€¶ Roy said to his buddies, pointing at the redhead, â€¶but she's too shy to strip on her own. So it'd be nice of us to help her start!â€¶<br><br>The richmen looked at the beautiful waitress with anticipation while Leo backed away, shushing the nearby patrons with a mischevious smirk. They didn't quite get what this vixen had planned, but it became apparent as soon as the rude redhead walked toward the banker, aiming to refill their glasses. Instead, however, the men all got up and surrounded the woman, removing the bottle from her hands grabbing her by the dress. Before she could react, the hem of her dress already going up, baring her soft, pale skin.<br><br>â€¶Hey, what are you doing? Stop! What the hell?!â€¶ she shouted and struggled as the bankers kept undressing her, having removing her dress and now working on her skimpy lingerie.<br><br>Francis stepped forward to help his employee, but Leo stopped him by putting her hand on his chest.<br><br>â€¶Wait a second, I'm sure she gets exactly what she wants. Or, rather, what she needs right now,â€¶ Leo giggled, watching as Roy's company held the redhead by all of her limbs while she tried to free herself with furious kicks and punches.<br><br>Chaos ensued in the lounge area, some patrons rushing to stop the bankers while the others cheered them on. Regardless of her efforts, the redhead was now naked, held in the air with her legs spread wide and her tits bouncing more and more as she tried to free herself. She became redder than a tomato as she realized her shapely figure was on display for dozens of eyes and cameras around her, desperately trying to cover herself as the wave of pure shame swallowed her whole.<br><br>Leo couldn't contain a chuckle, stripping unsuspecting Earthian girls will never get old.<br><br>â€¶Alright, I need to stretch my legs a little,â€¶ feeling that her work here was done, the countess turned her gaze away from the involuntary exhibitionism and focused on the dance floor a vast meadow of blaring music and writhing bodies under the sky of chandeliers.<br><br>Satisfied, energetic, and a bit drunk, Leo felt it was time for dancing.<br><br>***<br><br>The countess began gracefully striding through the sea of people while the spotlights kept her naked figure lit and the music blared all around her. Before Leo stepped onto the dance floor, she had a moment of doubt. It was packed very tightly, she'd have to practically press herself against other people if she wanted to dance. Then, she heard a couple whistles from the crowd, and the doubt disappeared, giving way to courage. Of course she was going to do it! How else would a proud naked lady like herself spread her culture, if not by showing it off head-on?<br><br>People were gasping and cheering around Leo, some stretching out their arms to pinch, slap, or fondle her body whenever they pleased. The patrons became visibly exited: of course, Leo was already partying with them for some time, but only now did they get a chance to see her so close, with no barriers remaining for their sexy interactions. Leo felt this as well, her excitement rising with each step she took.<br><br>Finally, she found an opening right in front of the DJ. That's when the countess realized she couldn't contain her energy anymore, and it poured out of her in a fast, sincere dance. Leo's hips swung to the beat, hypnotizing the men around her, her bare feet stomped the floor with enviable power, and the round shapes of her feminine figure bounced up and down with unseen intensity.<br><br>â€¶Wow, you go girl!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I can't believe she's actually doing this. How is she not shy?â€¶<br><br>â€¶That's what sin city is all about, baby!â€¶<br><br>Leo basked in all of the stares and comments, the feelings of patriotism and success in spreading Sanflarian values ringing through her mind. Of course, the commenters soon joined in, inviting Leo to dance with them one by one in a fast-paced succession. She whirled around with all kinds of men (and even some women), each letting her see their own style and character. Some spun Leo in graceful circles. Others led her in careful yet sure rhythm.<br><br>A couple bent over with her, teasing her with pecks on the lips. Of course, there were also those who simply wanted to grope the countess' body and landed their palms on her naked butt right away. She didn't protest. Who could blame these men after they've been deprived of naked female beauty for so long?<br><br>â€¶Come on, you're blocking the view for all the others!â€¶ she laughed from the guests' pinches, tickles, and groping.<br><br>With these words, Leo broke free of the insatiable crowd and marched toward DJ, who continued to barrage her with his suggestive comments.<br><br>â€¶I hope you've got some free space!â€¶ the countess exclaimed as she climbed up to the DJ booth like an agile feline, then stood on one of the tables, looking at Omnia's musical staff with naughty eyes.<br><br>â€¶Take it away, clothless countess, show us your passion!â€¶ DJ said, playing a new Sanflarian track that instantly brought Leo back to her teens.<br><br>â€¶Then watch and learn,â€¶ she replied, breaking into a wild dance that combines traditional moves of her people with energetic moves she learned today.<br><br>The crowd roared as the countess jumped and bounced in front of them like a mix between a stripper and an athletic go-go girl. The feeling of triumph was rising, and Leo reacted by starting a chant while doing jumping jacks, her hands loudly clapping after the end of each syllable.<br><br>â€¶Kir'ador! Kir'ador! Kir'ador!â€¶ the countess shouted louder and louder, hearing that the crowd gradually joined in, sharing this passionate moment with the naked Sanflarian.<br><br>Looking over Omnia, Leo could see the waitress she stripped. The poor redhead was running through the lounge around the dance floor, her hands on her privates and her cheeks burning from shame. The surrounding guests and staff laughed at her misfortunate while she bumped into people and yelled at them to get away. The waitress noticed Leo as well, throwing a hateful gaze at the blonde. They looked so different despite both being naked. One of them happy, big, and strong, the other spiteful and weak like a mouse.<br><br>â€¶Look at her!â€¶ Leo exclaimed proudly, â€¶one of us accepts her natural state of nudity while the other prefers to hide it under fabric, sacrificing her own confidence and harmony along the way!â€¶<br><br>The redhead disappeared from sight while the crowd kept laughing, clearly agreeing with Leo's point of view. While most women weren't in a hurry to follow her dogmas, several bold ones were already topless or dancing in their underwear, which meant that the seed was planted. Suddenly, Leo realized there was also one especially brave gal, who had already bared it all and now ran to the DJ booth completely naked. A closer look revealed that she already saw this girl before--her dark skin covered by tattoos resembling Mexican artworks or beasts was a dead giveaway.<br><br>Ximena raised her hands up as she neared the blonde, to which she responded by stretching out her own arms down and helping the Latino girl get up on the table. The two nudies stood alongside each other, enjoying the crowd's admiration.<br><br>â€¶I thought you'd never come,â€¶ Leo said with a jest while Ximena's fingers ran across her naked, glistening body.<br><br>â€¶Sorry, it was a long drive. But when I heard about your show, I knew I couldn't let myself skip it!â€¶<br><br>The two held each other's hands and heard the new track begin to play, loud music piercing their ears like a flurry of gunshots. Their bodies began to move as if hypnotized, both trying their best to wow both the audience and each other. Soon, Omnia's guests were treated to a spectacle of not one but two naked women moving and bending their bodies with alluring grace, their motions getting more sexual and their poses varying as the song went on.<br><br>Leo smirked looking at Ximena: it looked like the Latino girl enjoyed this even more than the countess did. Her eyes were closed, her lips were curled in a wide smile, and her hard, swollen nipples told Leo everything she needed to know about the girl's mood. Not wasting any time, the blonde enveloped her arms around Ximena's figure, bringing her closer. They began touching each other's figures, first with their hands, then with their entire bodies rubbing against each other, causing pleasant sensations in their pussies and nipples to rise like a gathering tsunami.<br><br>Dropping all inhibitions, they got down to their knees and finally kissed. In a second, they were already making out, intertwining their tongues and pushing them into each other's mouths as if their lives depended on it, much to the crowd's amazement. But this was only the beginning: feeling Ximena's drive to continue, Leo bent backward and let the Latino girl devour her nipples, moaning from pure pleasure.<br><br>â€¶Oh the Many-eyed!â€¶ Leo exclaimed with a look of bliss in her eyes, â€¶people like you make it all worth it.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I haven't finished yet!â€¶ Ximena said in a raspy, suggestive voice, and started moving her mouth lower.<br><br>The crowd kept cheering the horny girls on, and the two didn't feel any reason to stop, infatuated by each other's passion. Still, upon realizing what Ximena was about to do, Leo stopped her, gently wrapping her arms around the girl's shoulders.<br><br>â€¶No.â€¶<br><br>â€¶But why?â€¶ a hint of sadness appeared in Latino girl's eyes.<br><br>â€¶Because I wanna do it for you, not the other way around,â€¶ the blonde replied, licking her lips.<br><br>Reassuring her naked friend, Leo gently lied her down on her back and spread her legs, inspired by the crowd's woos. She started by gently licking and sucking on Ximena's nipples. When the Latino girl closed her eyes and her breathing got heavy, Leo knew it was time and went lower, landing her tongue right on her tight, shaven vulva. Ximena reacted with a flinch. Her pussy was wet even before the countess touched it, but there was still plenty of arousal to be had before the Hispanic girl finishes.<br><br>Leo took it slowly, gradually increasing the speed as she caressed Ximena's pussy with her mouth. Ximena's moaning grew louder while Leo's licking got faster and deeper. Of course, the countess didn't forget to savor this moment of togetherness in her own way: she put one of her hands on her pussy and began touching herself, her naughty fingers picking up the phase. This was crazier than Ximena's wildest exhibitionistic fantasies. She still couldn't believe it was happening, but the sexual impulses throughout her body didn't leave a room for doubt. The countess gave it her all, gifting her friend indescribable pleasure while fingering herself with no shame in her naughty eyes. Soon enough, Ximena couldn't contain herself anymore.<br><br>â€¶Yes, yes, you're a goddess!!!â€¶ she yelled into the air, reaching the best orgasm of her entire life while the crowd kept yelling around her.<br><br>Then she opened her eyes and saw Leo's face just above hers.<br><br>â€¶No, I'm just a mortal girl who loves who she is,â€¶ the blonde giggled and the two shared another passionate kiss.<br><br>When the two were done with their play and stood up, they were showered with applause of horny and tipsy patrons.<br><br>â€¶Not a bad photoshoot, huh?â€¶ Leo cockily asked Francis, who stood behind them and held the camera in his trembling hands.<br><br>â€¶Y-yes, indeed,â€¶ the man replied with hectic breaths, â€¶though I'm not sure if I'll be able to post some of them... Might be too much for the official resources.â€¶<br><br>Leo and Ximena shared a laugh with their arms on each other's round backsides.<br><br>â€¶Then what? Want us to pose for a moment? We won't be here tomorrow, you know!â€¶ the Latino girl said with a jest and winked at Leo.<br><br>â€¶Well, I think there is enough material as-is. Although... No, I don't think it's fair to ask of you two.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, forget it. The world isn't about being fair. It's about making the best out of what you have!â€¶ Leo countered, slapping Ximena's ass, â€¶so, what you want?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'd love to finish with both of you in the crowd, that'd be a nice closure, the feeling of unity and all that,â€¶ Francis replied.<br><br>The naked girls looked at the forest of hands behind them, realizing that even they couldn't predict what the aroused crowd would do if they landed in their arms and let them run wild, dropping their last inhibitions. Leo held Ximena's hand and looked at her with a hint of challenge in her sapphire eyes. To the blonde's surprise, the Latino girl didn't hesitate even for a moment. Instead, she smiled and raised one leg into the air, ready to share this unforgettable experience until the very end.<br><br>â€¶Here we come!â€¶ the blonde announced as the two of them jumped right onto the people below them, with a wave of cheering following their drop.<br><br>Francis approached the booth's edge and took out his camera, seeing Leo and Ximena getting carried by the patrons with their legs widely spread and their arms up in the air. The naked women waved and blew air kisses as numerous hands began covering their bodies. They didn't panic, nor did they feel any discomfort.<br><br>Instead, the two enjoyed this brief moment of spotlight and went with the flow, letting the crowd enjoy both the sight and touch of their bare forms. Francis couldn't contain his smile as his camera clicked several more times in rapid succession. Today was surely an unforgettable moment of joy, with almost everyone present appreciating the show.<br><br>Yet, between the horny men on the dance floor, wealthy clients in the VIP lounge, and the air show enjoyers, Francis knew that the happiest guest today was Leo herself." },
      { title: "Epilogue", summary: "The naked countess finished her journey.", content: "Eleonora and Milran of Kir'ador ended up spending a couple more days in Nevada before returning to their homeland. Despite everything, Milran's diplomatic meeting went even better than expected, partially because Leo attended as well and proceeded to distract the Earthians with her majestic form when she sat with her legs spread or bent over to â€¶pick up a pencil.â€¶ After the successful negotiation, the countess ended up spending a marvelous night with Ximena at the Caesar's Palace, during which the girls finished what they started in Omnia and explored each other's bodies to the fullest.<br><br>Leo's journey and final performance quickly went viral on social media, as well as on many kink websites that treated media involving the nude countess like a relic. Some of them even added a new category labeled â€¶Sanflarianâ€¶ with hopes of seeing more such voyages in the future. This marked a little but noticeable social shift as the interest in the other world grew; people now treated it less like an unknown land and more like a paradise with hot naked chicks, which would clearly give Sanflarians an upper hand in future negotiations.<br><br>Arnold also ended up enjoying the media of his friend walking around naked, though he was a bit sad that he couldn't see it in person. As he lied on his hospital bed, he had a lot of time to think, realizing that maybe searching for a submissive girlfriend wasn't the best priority to take and that he should focus on his own character for the time being. Fantasies were nice and all, but one had to look at things as they really were from time to time. After all, he already showed his backbone once by eating that bullet. Nothing should've stopped him from showing it again.<br><br>The clerk was a bit surprised when the door to his hospital room opened and Leo walked in, as naked as always, a large envelope in one hand and a shopping bag in another. It turned out that by â€¶sending the pictures herself,â€¶ she didn't just mean emailing them or sharing through social media, but instead that she'd come and meet him once again before leaving.<br><br>â€¶How are you wounds, my fellow warrior?â€¶ she smiled as she sat beside him and gently grabbed his hand.<br><br>Arnold couldn't help but smile, realizing how he came from being a simple hostage.<br><br>â€¶T-thanks, I'm okay. Great job with that Omnia show! I hope to see you again sometime, I really do.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, I'd love to visit your planet sometime in the future. But that'll depend on what my father decides. He's the ruler of Kir'ador, and, as you can imagine, probably won't be thrilled about me breaking the rules and crossing into your world on my own.â€¶<br><br>Noticing that Arnold frowned a little, Leo reassured him with a smile.<br><br>â€¶Even if I'm banned from traveling to Earth again, people like you are always welcome in Sanflaria. You're a hero, remember? Saved my life from that scum. I'll make sure you're given the best accommodations whenever you decide to visit... And the best female company you can wish for.â€¶<br><br>A hint of naughtiness sparked in Leo's eyes while Arnold just giggled and looked away, his cheeks becoming red once again.<br><br>â€¶Thanks for everything,â€¶ the clerk said, â€¶you know, I've been thinking whether this was a good idea to let you in. Sungoods and all that... But now I realize that it was. The risk was scary at first, but now I'm glad I took it.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Just as it often is,â€¶ Leo nodded with confidence. â€¶Oh, right, I also brought you some Sanflarian fruits to make you feel better. Make sure to taste the carafruit and undergreens. But don't mix them together, or you'll have to spend the rest of your stay fighting your own stomach.â€¶<br><br>They cracked a couple more jokes about their journey, and then Leo had to be on her way. Arnold's gaze longingly followed her taut butt as she walked away, shocking all the nurses and doctors in the corridor with her dominant attitude. He was still anxious about whether Leo's father would allow her to come back one day, and, for once, it was obvious that the blonde herself was too.<br><br>She got her answer on the last day of her stay, since her father, Tyriar the Liege of Kir'ador, decided to visit Earth himself to sort things out with ICA and offer his condolences for their fallen agents. Leo nervously stood in front of the large portal as it opened, its shining filling the entire floor. A strong gust of wind left the opening in the metal gate and caused a shilly sensation on the countess' skin, yet she didn't move a muscle. Despite everything, she was prepared. A group of Sanflarians started walking in, appearing one by one as the ICA staff welcomed them to Earth.<br><br>The first two were standard-bearers, one male and one female, symbolizing the union of secular and spiritual worlds. The male one had an elaborate attire of yellow and orange, holding a banner resembling both a symbol of Kir'ador and Sanflaria as a whole. The female one was a beautiful woman dressed in nothing but her confidence and painted glyphs of Many-eyed's church. She carried a staff with a shiny sphere at its end, which looked like somebody trapped many sunbeams within its glassy surface. A sunward--as Sanflarians called it--a device of high spiritual meaning, symbolizing that their God's gaze would protect them even away from home.<br><br>Then came the guard. Three men dressed in massive armor suits that made them look like futuristic cyborgs, with strange glassy devices resembling crystals all over their forms. They had plasma rifles in their hands, and their gazes were hidden behind helmets, prompting everyone in the room to be afraid of even the thought of messing with them. Finally, after several more men in fancy colourful suits and naked women left the portal, Leo saw her father.<br><br>He was a tall, middle-aged man with an expression and posture that imanated pure authority. This effect was even stronger because of his costume, somewhat similar to how a regular Earthian would imagine a medieval king, but with more elegancy and vibrant colors to it. Its pinnacle was a crown with rows of jewels, ending with peculiar oval peaks.<br><br>â€¶Wow,â€¶ said one of the ICA women near Leo.<br><br>â€¶Huh, you haven't seen our king yet,â€¶ the countess smirked.<br><br>The ruler greeted those around him and, after a short talk with the ICA commanders, turned to his daughter. Leo bowed before him, as the tradition demanded, then stood firmly in front of the man and awaited her judgment.<br><br>â€¶My liege,â€¶ she said in Sanflarian, her head up high despite nervousness.<br><br>Tyriar looked at his daughter, made a step toward her, and, to the surprise of some spectators, gave her a warm hug. The blonde replied in kind, enveloping her arms around Tyriar and burying her nose in his mantle like a little girl missing her parents.<br><br>â€¶I have worried about you,â€¶ he replied in Sanflarian as well, his voice stern yet caring.<br><br>â€¶I know. But I'm alright, so there was nothing to worry about!â€¶ Leo replied with a confident smirk.<br><br>â€¶Eleonora.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, I understand,â€¶ the blonde nodded.<br><br>After exchanging pleasantries and making sure he knew all of the situation, Tyriar finally spoke:<br><br>â€¶My daughter, your actions were brave, but they were also reckless. Nevertheless, your voyage to Earth allowed you to save Milran from death, uncover a plot to overthrow our house that was being prepared in our biggest barony, and strengthen the bonds between our worlds. For this, you shall be awarded with a hero's welcome and a more prominent role in our Earth-related matters from now on. Once the conflict with the Barony of Puranad is resolved, you can expect to receive other rewards as well.â€¶<br><br>The blonde barely contained herself, wanting to jump up from joy.<br><br>â€¶However,â€¶ his tone became more strict, prompting Leo to listen carefully, â€¶you've also left Sanflaria unannounced and put yourself at risk without consulting with me or your mother first. For that, you shall be punished by working in the portal maintenance workshop throughout the Bonfire Week. This will let you learn more about the portals and how to treat the interworld journeys with respect.â€¶<br><br>Leo fell silent for a moment, and her eye began to twitch a little from those news.<br><br>â€¶The entire Bonfire Week? But it's holiday and now all of my plans are...â€¶ she started, then let out a sigh and looked at her father once again. â€¶I understand, father. It's harsh, but just.â€¶<br><br>She was always taught that a bad act does not cancel out the good, nor does the good cancel out the bad, so both punishment and a reward were quite fitting for her parents' philosophy. Then, Tyriar turned to Milran with far less enthusiasm. Leo's cousin felt his soul sinking into his boots under the ruler's piercing gaze. Before he even managed to say a word, Tyriar said a simple yet haunting phrase:<br><br>â€¶I have already informed your parents of your shortcomings. They will have a very lengthy discussion with you, young man.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Good luck. You'll need it,â€¶ Eleonora jokingly hit her cousin with an elbow while he barely stood on his feet.<br><br>Then, there were a lot of talks and formal pleasantries aimed at easing the tensions caused by Puranad's betrayal and their cooperation with local criminals. It quickly became clear that Cobra wasn't getting off scot-free, and her way back to Kir'ador would end up in a jail cell. The same could be said about her older brother, Baron Viporius, who--the other delegation members told Leo--was arrested the same day as the message about his plans reached Tyriar and his wife. This calmed the countess' heart a little. Even if there were still dangers waiting in the future, at least her province was safe for now.<br><br>â€¶It was nice to meet you, all things considered,â€¶ Debrah said before waving Eleonora goodbye, â€¶I hope that now you've beaten your apprehension, maybe you'll try wearing clothing in the future?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Never!â€¶ the blonde exclaimed proudly, â€¶I might tolerate your customs now, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna sacrifice my own.â€¶<br><br>And thus Eleonora of Kir'ador returned to her homeworld, feeling both satisfied and intrigued by her stay in Nevada. When she first entered that portal, she'd never guess how much the trip would change her. How many new thoughts and ideas it'd bring, and how difficult it would be to deal with some issues that arose along the way. In any case, Leo knew it was all for the best, as the challenges and battles allowed her to grow and rethink many of her values, which will come in handy in the future.<br><br>Especially since, while it was her first trip to Earth, it surely wasn't going to be her last." }
