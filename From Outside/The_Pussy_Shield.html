                    subtitle: "Introduction",
                    content: `Throw all of your clothing into the fire, the Master commands. I am standing stark naked in an open field. My Master has just ordered me to surrender the last of my worldly possessions into a great bonfire. From now on, I own nothing except my body, and even then it really belongs to my Master. How did I get into this situation? I think back ...<br><br>I am sitting alone in my rented studio apartment looking at want ads for a better job. My current minimum wage job at Easy Breezy Meatloaves is going nowhere. I have no money. In fact, I am three months behind on my rent, and the landlord has threatened eviction more than once. On my kitchen counter I see a framed 5"x7" picture of me and my parents when I was 13. It was taken when we were at a park, one of the happiest times of my life. But those times are over now. My parents have both passed away, and being working class unskilled laborers themselves, they did not leave me very much. All my friends from high school have gone off to college and have their own lives with new friends from the dorms and new boyfriends. Graduating near the bottom of my high school class, I have no direction in life and am bored stiff from working, eating, sleeping, working, eating, sleeping, etc. I see an ad that looks too good to be true: Maids for Hire. No experience necessary. Will train. Must be young, good-looking, and willing to show some skin. Full benefits. Room and board included. Contact Katherine at 555-555-1234.<br><br>I consider myself pretty and good-looking. My petite body of 5' 2", 110 lbs., blue eyes, shoulder length blonde hair, and fair skin has caught the eyes of several boys in high school, but they all turned out to be jerks. I certainly don’t mind showing some skin. They probably have some skimpy maid outfit for me to wear. I am not modest. That "room and board included" part was probably the clincher that motivated me to call. I have not eaten in two days, because I have no money to buy food.<br><br>'ring, ring'<br><br>"Hello."<br><br>"Hello, my name is Marissa, and I am calling about your ad in the paper, the one for maids."<br><br>"Yes, we have an opening for a new maid. Are you interested?"<br><br>"Yes, I am."<br><br>"My name is Katherine."<br><br>"Hello, Katherine."<br><br>Katherine then interviews me over the phone right then and there. Over the next 90 minutes, she asks me all the usual interview questions: previous experience, right to work in the country, job requirements, etc. I ask about the maid outfit. Katherine says that I will be given a standard-looking French maid uniform typically seen in upscale hotels. Those uniforms look pretty conservative and don’t show that much skin. It’s all relative I suppose. Katherine asks me to send a recent photograph of me. All I have is my driver license photo. Katherine says that it would do if that is all I have.<br><br>We have a second telephone interview a few days later after Katherine receives the photocopy of my driver’s license. This time she asks much more personal questions about my past and current financial situation. She also asks about my friends and family and some basic medical history. I cannot imagine how these relate to my job, but I am getting hungry and desperate for work. I answer them all truthfully figuring that I have nothing to lose and room and board to gain.<br><br>Katherine feels satisfied and asks me to come meet her, the maid staff, and owner in person. She gives me an address, which happens to be 400 miles away. No knowing why, I decide to go for it. I quit my job, sell all my possessions (what little I have) except for my clothes, my family photo, and two suitcases, pay my rent, then buy a one-way bus ticket with the leftover money, and head off to meet my new prospective employer.<br><br>When the taxi pulls up to the address I gave him, I thought the driver made a mistake. The place is a palace! The estate must be at least 100 acres. From the outside, the main house itself looks to be at least 12,000 square feet. After making sure this is the correct address, I get out of the taxi, pay the driver, drag my two suitcases to the front gate, then ring the bell.<br><br>A beautiful woman wearing a silky French maid outfit struts out to greet me, and I do mean strut. She is 5' 6", 130 lbs., green eyes, neck-length auburn hair, maybe late twenties. Her clingy uniform is silk black except for the white apron with white lace fringes on the hems and trimmed with shirred white lace you typically see on all classic French maid uniforms. The dress’ sleeves are long but have puffed shoulder puffs. A frill is in her hair, and white lace cuffs wrap around her wrists. A high collar covers her neck. Her black fishnet stockings and black high heels complete the ensemble. The only thing unusually about her is that her skirt is full length.<br><br>"You must be Marissa."<br><br>"Yes, that’s me."<br><br>"Welcome. I am Katherine. Please come in."<br><br>She opens the gate for me to enter. The front garden is well-manicured and good enough for a home and garden magazine. On our way to the main house, I see a woman tending to the grounds with a small hand shovel in one hand and a pot of dirt in the other. She is wearing a bright yellow maid uniform. The frill, apron, collar, puffed shoulders are white and identical in style to Katherine’s, but the skirt falls to just above the knees, is pleated, her sleeves end at the shoulder puffs exposing her arms, and her white, ruffled knickers and petticoat display, especially when she bends over. Because of the shorter skirt, her black fishnet stockings and black high heels are much more evident.<br><br>"Sally, this is Marissa, our newest recruit. She just arrived."<br><br>"Hi Marissa. Pleased to meet you."<br><br>"Hi Sally. Pleased to meet you, too."<br><br>Sally returns to her landscaping while Katherine and I continue our long walk to the house. It is rather unusual that a maid would be tending the grounds and dressed in such an unusual looking outfit. Most people working the grounds would be dressed in grubbies, jeans, or dark-colored overalls, not a bright yellow maid uniform. She must be just getting started, because I did not see a speck of dirt anywhere on it. Hmm.<br><br>Katherine opens the front door to the house. The entryway alone is bigger than the eatery I was working in. The entire building could probably fit inside this entryway. As Katherine leads me through some hallways to the back of the house my nose passes the kitchen where I see a female chef preparing a meal. Wearing a traditional chef’s outfit, she is 5' 5", 145 lbs, black hair, brown eyes and slightly chubby from snacking too much. I have not eaten in almost five days and cannot help but stop for a moment to let the aroma of food into my nostrils. Next to the kitchen is the dining room, where I see a naked woman vacuuming the floor. She is 5' 4", 125 lbs. and has green eyes. Her hair is a mix of blonde and black wavy strands and runs halfway down her back. She appears to be of Spanish descent. A naked woman?! I only catch a glimpse of her and notice some shiny object on her pussy but cannot make out what it is. What kind of a place is this? What have I gotten myself into? Katherine motions me to continue following her.<br><br>We enter Katherine’s office, a 15'x15' room almost as big as my studio apartment. Katherine sits behind her desk, but no chairs are in the room for me to sit, so I just stand there. She hands me a piece of paper. Part of it reads:<br><br>"Welcome to the Master’s estate as his newest recruit. Recruit slave is your first step to becoming an indentured servant under the Master. It is an opportunity for you to understand our lifestyle and philosophy and decide for yourself if you want to commit to the program. Although nudity is highly recommended, you are not required to disrobe when performing your duties, except for the entrance exam. At the end of the recruitment phase, if either party decides that this line of work is not a good fit for you, you may leave without any shame, obligation, or debt. Recruit slaves sleep in locked cages in the dungeon. The requirements for recruit slave are:<br><br><ol type="1"><li>18 years of age or older</li> <li>Able to move at least 50 lbs.</li> <li>Shows an ability and willingness to follow orders.</li> <li>Pass the following fitness tests:</li> <ol type="a"><li>20 push-ups in one minute</li> <li>30 sit-ups in one minute</li> <li>1.5 mile run-walk in 20 minutes</li> <li>200m swim in 12 minutes</li></ol> <li>Wear the maid uniform for a recruit.</li> <li>Pass the nudity entrance exam.</li></ol><br><br>If you can pass these requirements, then you may begin your 30 day trial period."<br><br>The document lists other legalese, which I don’t quite understand and just browse over. After I am done reading, Katherine asks me if I have any questions and to sign at the bottom. I should have asked some questions, especially about the naked woman in the dining room, the dungeon and the nude exam, but maybe it was my lack of nourishment or maybe it was because I had no money and nowhere else to go that motivated me to sign on the dotted line. I also figure I would at least get food and a roof over my head for 30 days. That would give me some time to figure something else out and move on if I wanted to.<br><br>Katherine walks over to a closet and pulls out a maid uniform. It looks identical to the one I saw Sally wear, except that this is all white. She also pulls out some fishnet stockings and black shoes.<br><br>"I think these will fit you. Try them on."<br><br>"Okay. Where can I change?"<br><br>"There is a bathroom next door."<br><br>I change into the dress, then return to Katherine’s office.<br><br>"Marissa, the dress looks good on you. Now that you have signed on with us, let’s give you the grand tour."<br><br>"Katherine, may I have something to eat first? I have not eaten in while."<br><br>"Oh, of course. I should have thought about that. You must be starved. I will have Slave Linda whip something up for you. You can do the fitness test tomorrow when you are well-rested and well-fed. You’ll like the food here. Slave Linda is an excellent chef."<br><br>I think, ‘SLAVE? Linda.’ Whatever. Just get me something to eat.<br><br>Leaving my luggage in Katherine’s office, we head to the kitchen where Linda throws together a Cobb salad, which I promptly inhale.<br><br>Katherine then shows me the grounds. Magnificent would be an understatement: library, game room, fitness room, dining room, breakfast nook, ballroom, living room, family room, utility room. Outside is an Olympic size swimming pool, Jacuzzi, barbecue area, and nine-hole golf course. There is even an atrium. I could get used to this place fast. I see other maids working in and around the house, each wearing different colors (that is red, blue, or purple) on their French maid uniforms but still having the same basic design with white trim and apron, black stockings, and black shoes. Only Katherine has a black one and the only full-length skirt.<br><br>After a while I get really sleepy, probably from all the blood rushing to my stomach and the events of the day. I ask Katherine where I can lay down. Katherine leads me downstairs into the dungeon. The dungeon is not a cozy place and much different from the house I saw above: hard concrete floor, naked light bulbs, chains hanging from the ceiling. Torture equipment is everywhere. Cages of varying sizes line the walls. Another wall holds various, canes, whips, paddles, and floggers. I heard about such places but never thought I would actually see one. My heart starts to pump; my brow perspires. I get scared but still feel brave enough to ask a meek question.<br><br>"Katherine, are you going to torture me?"<br><br>"Oh no, it’s only your first day." Katherine casually replies, "I imagine you are very tired from your long trip here and feel overwhelmed by all the activities. Besides you have not learned all the rules yet, which reminds me, here is your rulebook. I expect you to read it entirely by the end of the month. We are letting you take it easy on your first day."<br><br>"Umm okay."<br><br>I take the book from her hand. It is a saddle stitched, pocket-sized paperback folded over.<br><br>Katherine opens one of the smaller cages and tells me to lay down in it. The cage is a four-foot cube with bars on all sides and a solid metal top. The floor is also solid metal, probably stainless steel.<br><br>I humbly oblige. The floor feels a little cold at first, but my body heat quickly warms it up. She closes the door then locks it with a key.<br><br>"I’ll come by later to let you out for dinner."<br><br>Not realizing how tired I truly am, I barely hear her climb up the stairs as I drift off to sleep, curled up in a little ball.<br><br><i>Current rank: Recruit Slave</i>`

                    content: `I was definitely tired. You have to be in order to not only sleep well in a new environment, but also on a hard metallic surface. When I wake up, I cannot tell what time it is. The dungeon has no windows or clocks. A small nightlight provides what little illumination there is. I think someone else is sleeping in another cage across the dungeon but cannot tell who it is. No longer feeling tired, I try to open the cage door, but it remains locked. I am trapped until someone lets me out. My white maid uniform provides some warmth, but not enough for the drafty dungeon.<br><br>I see I still have my rule book. With nothing to do and nowhere to go, I open it and try reading the <i>Slave’s Rulebook.</i><br><br>Study this book carefully and know its rules. As rules change, new editions of the book will be published and distributed to all slaves. Whenever an order from the Master contradicts with the rulebook, the Master’s order takes precedence.<p><strong><em><i>Rank and Insignia</i></em></strong></p><p>"All slaves have ranks, which are signified by the color of their maid uniforms:</p><table class="rank-table">   <tr><td>Head Slave</td><td>black</td></tr>   <tr><td>First Class Slave</td><td>purple</td></tr>   <tr><td>Second Class Slave</td><td>blue</td></tr>   <tr><td>Third Class Slave</td><td>red</td></tr>   <tr><td>Apprentice Slave</td><td>yellow</td></tr>   <tr><td>Recruit Slave</td><td>white*</td></tr> </table><p class="note">* real dress</p><p>I turn a few pages.</p><p>Forms of Address</p><br><br>"The Master shall always be addressed as Master. Do not use his name along with his title.<br><br>"When addressing a slave of higher rank, you must address her as "Mistress" or with Mistress followed by her name, such as "Mistress Jane." For brevity, addressing her as Mistress suffices most of the time. However, if more than one slave of a higher rank is in your presence, and you want to avoid confusion, then using her name along with her title is appropriate and encouraged.<br><br>"When addressing a slave of lower rank, you should address her as "slave" or in the case of multiple lower ranks in your presence, "slave jane" to avoid confusion.<br><br>"When addressing a slave of equal rank, you may address her using just her first name. No title is required."<br><br>I see the asterisk next to the recruit slave’s color and "real dress" beneath it, but do not know what it means. I turn the page but before having a chance to read further, I hear someone coming down the stairs. It’s Katherine.<br><br>"Good morning, slaves"<br><br>"Good morning, Katherine." I reply.<br><br>"That’s Mistress to you, slave. I assume you have been reading your rule book."<br><br>"Yes, I am sorry, Mistress Katherine."<br><br>Katherine lets me out of my cage, then walks over to Sally’s cage and wakes her up.<br><br>"Get up, slave! It’s time to get up!" Katherine raises her voice but with a gentle tone.<br><br>Sally slowly crawls out of her cage. She is naked, except for a chastity belt she is wearing. The one-inch wide belt wraps snuggly around her waist. Another piece of metal extends from the belt down over her pussy. In-between her buttocks is a thin metal bar covering her crack. Made of stainless steel, the belt is lined with neoprene between her and her skin and on the edges to prevent chaffing. Sally rises to her feet and walks into another room adjoining the dungeon. Katherine turns to me.<br><br>"You better get cleaned up, slave. It’s going to be a long day."<br><br>"Yes, Mistress."<br><br>I follow Sally into the next room, where I see a row of bunk beds, some with bedding, others just a bare mattress. It becomes clear to me that higher ranked slaves sleep in here. All the other slaves are up. Some are fixing their hair; others are showering. I remove my clothes and enter the community shower area. The shower area is just like the showers in a locker room, one large room with showerheads and handles every few feet along the wall. I pick one and start washing myself. Sally and another slave are showering, too. Oh, it’s the same one who was vacuuming in the nude yesterday. She still has that piece of metal covering her pussy. When I am done washing, I turn off the shower, then start looking for a towel. I see none. Soaking wet, I ask one of the slaves where I can get a towel. Sally says there are no towels. All slaves use the air dryers. She points in the direction she is headed. Next to the showers are large heated air blowers. They are similar to the ones you see in public restrooms to dry your hands, but these are much larger. I follow Sally’s lead by pressing a button, and stand in front of the blower. The warm air feels wonderful but eventually shuts off by itself. It takes three button pressings to get dry and toasty warm. I put my maid uniform back on, and head upstairs.<br><br>I reach the dining room and kitchen. Linda is already hard at work preparing breakfast. I walk over to the dining room and start looking for a seat, but Katherine tells me that lower ranked slaves eat in the breakfast nook. She is correct. Everyone seated at the table is at least wearing a second class uniform or higher. Feeling very humble, I promptly exit to the kitchen.<br><br>When I reach the breakfast nook, I see that Sally and the naked slave are already seated. Sally is once again wearing her yellow maid uniform.<br><br>"Good morning, slave Marissa." Sally greets.<br><br>"Good morning, Sally. I mean Mistress Sally."<br><br>"Do you know Maria?" Sally asks.<br><br>"No, I don’t. Are you a slave here, too?" I ask Maria.<br><br>"Yes, I am," Maria answers, "but you would not know it, would you, without my uniform."<br><br>"Maria likes going around in the nude. Well I guess we all do, but Maria likes to show off more than the rest of us. Don’t you, Mistress Maria?" Sally explains.<br><br>"Mistress Maria?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes, Maria is a third class." Sally says.<br><br>"Oh, I see. Well, pleased to meet you, Mistress Maria."<br><br>I sit down just as breakfast is served. Linda puts down a plate full of eggs, sausage, fruits, and bagels. I have not eaten like this in so long. When you are cash-strapped, a slice of bread is as far as it goes in the morning. We all dig in just as the higher ranks do in the dining room. Sally and I get to know each other a little better. I tell her and Maria about my background, where I grew up, which school I went to, and how I got here. I also tell her a little about my life circumstances, such as my job at Easy Breezy Meatloaves, never having enough money, and falling behind on my rent. Sally is also an orphan but at a younger age. She went to live with her aunt and uncle. Her uncle worked for the same company as the Master. Her aunt stayed home and tended to the front and back yards. Sally grew up on a huge lot and learned to love gardening and landscaping as much as her aunt. Her aunt and uncle both died in a tragic airplane crash. The Master and Sally’s uncle were good friends, so he decided to take her in, just as Sally graduated from high school. Not ready to venture into the world at 18, Sally just got here a few months ahead of me.<br><br>"My specialty is going to be landscaping." Sally says proudly.<br><br>"That’s great that you have found a calling. I am still trying to find myself."<br><br>"Well, I’ll help you any way I can. I guess you and I are the same age, and we sleep in the dungeon together. We’ll be seeing a lot of each other."<br><br>After breakfast, I start helping everyone clean up, putting away dishes in the dishwasher, wiping the table, etc. when Katherine interrupts me and asks me to follow her. Another small room in the house I have not seen, it looks like a physician’s examining room with examining table in the center, cotton balls, tongue depressors on the counter, and the like.<br><br>"Slave, it is time for your physical exam." Katherine kindly explains, "The doctor will be here in a few minutes. Please wait here."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>After a few moments, a man in a white lab coat knocks on the door and enters. Very neatly dressed, he appears to be in his late thirties, 5' 10", medium build, almost handsome, brown hair, and brown eyes.<br><br>"Good morning. You are Marissa?"<br><br>"Yes, and you are the doctor?<br><br>"Yes, I am Dr. Otis. I will be doing your physical exam today. How are you today?"<br><br>"Oh, I feel just fine."<br><br>"Good. This is a full physical exam. Did Katherine explain anything to you about it?"<br><br>"No, I just knew there would be one, but I don’t know what is involved."<br><br>"That’s all right. I will explain as we go along. Please remove all your clothing."<br><br>All my clothing? Oh dear. Except for my father I don’t think a man has ever seen me naked before. I never slept with any of my boyfriends. I prefer seeing women doctors, and even then I only had to strip to my underwear in their examining rooms. But he is a doctor, and I suppose he knows what he is doing. He turns towards the counter and starts doing some paperwork. This must be the nude exam listed in the contract I signed. With some hesitation, I slowly remove my shoes, stockings, maid outfit, and knickers. He turns around and asks me to get up on the table, which I do.<br><br>"Do you have any physical ailments I should know about? Are you on any medications?"<br><br>I answer both in the negative.<br><br>At first the exam is pretty routine: checking my eyes, ears, nose and throat, elbow and knee reflexes. He takes my height, weight, temperature, and blood pressure, and all the other things one would expect. He asks other routine medical questions as we go along. Even the pap smear is routine. The law in this state requires that an adult female be present during the pap smear, so he asks Katherine to come in. Very professionally, he performs the pap smear, then Katherine leaves. I begin to think he is an okay doctor, but then the unexpected happens.<br><br>"Please lie down on the table. I need to check your breasts for lumps."<br><br>I comply and his fingers start rolling around my breasts. He takes his sweet time doing it, even touching the nipples with his fingertips. His hands then slide down to my stomach and hips and feels around my pussy area.<br><br>"Please roll onto you stomach."<br><br>I roll over, and he places his palms on my back, sliding them down to my buttocks. His fingers even enter my rectum.<br><br>"Excellent. Please stand up."<br><br>As I get up, Dr. Otis, takes out a paper tape measure, the kind tailors use. He begins measuring my body, every bit of it, neck shoulder, chest, around my breasts, waist, hips, crotch, legs, foot size, wrist size, ankle size, everything. Periodically he goes back to the clipboard on the counter to take notes.<br><br>After putting the tape measure away, he pulls out a beaker from the cabinet. "We need a urine sample. You can use this."<br><br>"Okay. can I use the bathroom?"<br><br>"No, just go here."<br><br>Well, now a man gets to watch me pee, too. There is no privacy in this house.<br><br>I place the beaker on the floor and begin peeing. Dr. Otis does not seem to look or even care and continues to take notes. The blood test is the last thing and is pretty routine.<br><br>"Marissa, you seem very healthy. From a physical standpoint and assuming the blood and urine tests come out normal, you should not have any problems performing your duties here. Do you have any questions?"<br><br>"No, I don’t think so."<br><br>"Well, if you do, just have Katherine contact me. She has my number."<br><br>"Thank you, Dr. Otis."<br><br>"You are welcome. Have a good day."<br><br>He packs up his stuff and leaves leaving me sitting naked on the table.<br><br>Not knowing what to do now, I get dressed and walk back to Katherine’s office. I see Dr. Otis just walking out of her office, and I walk in.<br><br>"Ah, slave Marissa. I was just talking to Dr. Otis. He says that the exam went well, and you are very healthy."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>"Good. Now it is time for your fitness test. Come with me." She grabs a clipboard with some forms on it and a stop watch, and we head to the fitness room.<br><br>"Okay. Let’s see. The first test is push-up. Go ahead and give me as many as you can in one minute. You need 20 to pass."<br><br>"Mistress Katherine. Don’t you think I should change into my gym clothes first, something more comfortable? I mean I don’t want to wrinkle or ruin this dress."<br><br>"No, I am afraid not. The only outfit you are allowed to wear as a recruit slave is the white maid uniform. You can either take your fitness test in that or do it in the nude."<br><br>Great, more nudity. I easily decide to keep my clothes on and lay face down on the floor. Katherine presses a button on the stopwatch and counts aloud as I do my push-ups.<br><br>"1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-Time!"<br><br>My body drops to the floor; my breath starts to get heavy.<br><br>"Next are sit-ups." She counts aloud just like the push-ups, which I do pass in the time allotted. The 1½ mile run is done on the treadmill machine. Katherine programs it so I must keep up in the time allotted. If I fall off the treadmill, I don’t pass. Thankfully, I pass both tests but am very sweaty at this point.<br><br>"Okay, the only thing left is the swim test."<br><br>Out to the pool we go. The length of the pool is exactly 50 meters and has six marked lanes for laps. It even has diving platforms just like what you would see at a swim meet.<br><br>"Mistress Katherine, my swimsuit is in my luggage. Shall I go get it?"<br><br>"Swim suits are not allowed. You can only wear your maid uniform."<br><br>"Oh yea, I forgot."<br><br>"I strongly recommend you remove your clothes for the swim test. You will swim more easily, and you would not have to spend the rest of the day wearing wet clothes."<br><br>I have no way to get around this one. I could manage some perspiration but not a soaking wet maid uniform. I look around the pool area to see who else is around. Katherine casually and patiently writes on her clipboard. Maybe this is the nude test mentioned in the contract. I take a deep breath and slowly remove my garments: first the shoes and stockings, then the frill, and dress. Finally with one last look around I quickly remove my knickers and dive into the pool stark naked. As soon as my head reaches the surface, Katherine says, "Go."<br><br>It would be a fairly easy swim test for me except that I am already tired from all the previous tests. Aside from a drink of water, I did not have much of a break in-between any of them. When I finish the final lap, I am holding onto the side with both hands and looking down into the water trying to catch my breath. I hear Katherine’s encouraging voice. "Congratulations, slave Marissa. You made it with five second to spare. You passed the fitness test."<br><br>What a relief. I have room and board for the next 30 days and hopefully no more nudity requirements. I see the shadow of someone bending over me next to the pool offering a hand to help me out. It must be Katherine. Without looking up, I reach out, grab the hand, and get pulled out of the pool. Standing up, I see that it was not Katherine who lifted me but a man whom I have never seen before.<br><br>"You’re a pretty good swimmer. Perhaps we can swim together some time." He kindly says.<br><br>"AAAAAAAHH!!!!"<br><br>I quickly cover my breasts and pussy with my arms, turn around, and jump back in the pool.<br><br>"slave Marissa, are you all right?" Katherine asks.<br><br>In a state of shock, I say nothing and just look at Katherine and the strange man looking at me. He speaks again. "I’m sorry. I did not mean to startle you. I have not had a chance to meet you yet and saw you swimming out here."<br><br>"slave Marissa, I want you to meet Master."<br><br>"Master!? This is THE Master?" I shout.<br><br>"Yes, that’s right." Katherine replies. She then speaks to Master. "slave Marissa just satisfied the fitness requirement for recruit slave."<br><br>"Well congratulations, slave Marissa. I look forward to getting to know you better. Well, I better return to my den. Got a lot of work to do. See you later."<br><br>He walks back into the house.<br><br>"How dare he see me naked! This may be his house, but I’ve got my self-respect."<br><br>"Master was just curious about you and meant no harm. He has seen all of us naked."<br><br>"All of you?"<br><br>"Yes. He is a good man and treats us all very well. I am sure in time you will get to know and like him."<br><br>"I’ll bet." I mumble sarcastically.<br><br>"Get out of the pool. You have one final test to perform."<br><br>Katherine returns to the house leaving me in the pool. I feel ashamed that that man saw me like he did. He may own the place, but this is my body. Well, he is allowing me to stay here, and I have no place else to go. Did she say another test? I thought I was done and am now a recruit slave. I get out of the pool and want to put on my clothes but am wet. Soon Katherine returns with a key in her hand.<br><br>"Follow me."<br><br>I begin to pick up my clothes, but Katherine says "Leave them."<br><br>Feeling ashamed already, I cover myself with my arms again the best I can and follow Katherine out to the front of the house. I keep a sharp eye out for Master and any other peeping male eyes.<br><br>Katherine casually asks me to go out and fetch the mail. I vaguely remember seeing a mailbox when I rang the bell at the gate but don’t recall exactly where it is or what it looks like. I have never stepped outside the grounds since coming here.<br><br>"What did you say, Mistress?"<br><br>Katherine hands me the key to open the mail box and says, "Get the mail nude."<br><br>She says it with such a serious poker face, I almost don’t believe her. We stare at each other for a few more seconds, then I realize she is absolutely serious. It’s one thing to be naked on someone’s private property with tall fences and mostly women; it’s another thing to actually go out in public naked. Past the gate, I occasionally see cars drive by or people walking their dogs. It’s a fairly affluent neighborhood, and the residents are spread out, but still.<br><br>"Mistress Katherine, I am not sure about this. I don’t know ..."<br><br>"It’s in the contract you signed. If you want to stay here as a slave, you must get the mail in the nude."<br><br>Katherine senses my reservations about what to do, so she calls Maria out from inside the house. Maria steps outside naked as usual and asks how she can serve the Mistress.<br><br>"slave Maria, please fetch the mail for me."<br><br>"Yes, Mistress." Maria takes the key from my hand and without skipping a beat, walks straight to the gate, opens it, disappears to where I assume the mailbox is, then returns with two handfuls of envelopes and small packages. In less than ten minutes, she does the whole task like there was nothing to it.<br><br>"Excellent work, slave. Please take them inside and sort through the mail."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>Maria disappears inside the house. Katherine turns to me. "Since you are new here I will give you another chance to do this tomorrow. I want to give you some time to think about this in case you were reluctant to fetch the mail today. You can try it again tomorrow. Perhaps Maria’s demonstration has shown how easy it is."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>"Until then, slave Sally and slave Maria can get you started on the household chores."<br><br>Now I am faced with another big decision. I have no back-up plans for establishing a life outside this place. If I leave tomorrow, I am back to square one. In this case, I am a homeless, penniless person on the street. Aside from the nudity, living here may not be so bad. Tomorrow I am going to get that mail.<br><br>The next day, I dread my next big nude test all day long. I try not to think about it and just concentrate on cleaning the kitchen and helping Linda move some 50 lb bags of flour. But time catches up with me, and the hour of truth has arrived. When Katherine asks me what I am going to do today, I tell her that I will get the mail naked. When I remove all my clothes, she hands me the key and watches me sneak up to the gate. I look through the gate in all directions, making sure the coast is clear. I look behind me to see Katherine and now Sally watching me. I look through the gate again to make sure. I slowly open the gate, and peek out some more. I can see the mailbox is just twenty feet away. My heart is racing. I run like crazy to the mailbox and try jamming the key into the lock. It feels like it takes two minutes to get the darn door open; although I am sure it was more like two seconds. I grab all the mail, then shut the mailbox and run back through the gate, using envelopes to hide my breasts. It’s over. I did it.<br><br>Sally smiles and claps for me. Katherine just sits there and smiles with pride.<br><br>As I walk up to them, I say with excitement, "Did you see me? I did it!"<br><br>"Yes you did, slave. Congratulations." Katherine says proudly, "You passed the nudity entrance exam and can be a recruit slave."<br><br>"Does this mean I can stay?"<br><br>"Yes, you can stay for 30 days. Now go put on your uniform and put the mail away."<br><br>"Thank you, Mistress."<br><br>What a relief. I have my 30 days. Now if only I can get used to this nudity thing.<br><br><i>Current rank: Recruit Slave</i>`

                    subtitle: "The Teapot", 
                    content: `Over the next few weeks, I learn and do all the household chores, from dusting and vacuuming, to sweeping and waxing floors, cleaning every room in the house, and even washing all the cars. Boy, Master sure owns a lot of cars. Sally and Maria are a big help to me in learning the ropes, especially Sally. I spend some time in the gardens with her, filling pots with dirt, watering plants, etc. I don’t think I really care for landscaping that much; I just like hanging around with Sally, because she is so easy to talk to. Every night, I am locked in my cage and released the next morning to start my daily routines. Once a week it is my turn to retrieve the mail. I have to do it naked. It gets easier each time, but my adrenaline is always pumping when I am on the look out for a passersby.<br><br>I also get to meet all the other slaves in the house: Jackie, a first class slave, is head of security and a black belt in jujitsu. She is 5' 9" 165 lbs in the right places, has medium brown hair and hazel eyes. She is tough as nails and a bit tomboyish. Sara is a second class slave and is the Master’s personal masseuse. She is also responsible for maintaining the fitness room equipment. She is 5' 6" 130 lbs, has blue eyes and long blonde hair. Both Jackie and Sara are responsible for putting together an exercise regimen to keep all the slaves in shape. Most mornings we do daily exercises led by Jackie, which means occasionally jujitsu lessons. Some wear workout clothes or jujitsu uniforms; some their maid uniforms, and there is Maria who works out in the nude. Sometimes even Master joins us for some step aerobics.<br><br>In our free time, some of us go swimming or skinny dipping in the pool. I start noticing those shiny metallic triangles covering everyone’s pussies (except for Sally who has a chastity belt). Part of me feels left out for not having anything to cover my pussy.<br><br>About one meal per week, the Master would sit with us at the breakfast nook instead of the main dining room. He seems to make a point to get to know all of his slaves and is a good conversationalist. We laugh at his jokes not because we feel we have to please him but because they really are funny, at least I think so.<br><br>I also get to spend some one-on-one time with Master. He goes beyond just asking me general questions about where I was born or what where I worked before this. He wants to know what my favorite color is, what my favorite food is, and how I am adjusting to life here. I casually mention strawberries as my favorite food, and the next day we start to have strawberries for breakfast every morning for a week. I can see why all the other slaves are so fond of him. He is extremely attractive, not just physically but emotionally and mentally as well. He also does not forget anything I tell him.<br><br>"Red and strawberries are my favorite, Master."<br><br>"Why strawberries? He asks.<br><br>"Because they’re red?" I reply.<br><br>He laughs, and I laugh with him.<br><br>Every Monday morning in the dungeon before breakfast, all the slaves gather to listen to any announcements that the Master or Katherine may have. Then, we all hold our rulebooks in our left hands with palms facing up, raise our right hands, and recite the Slave’s Oath: "I, {name}, give body, mind, and spirit to the servitude of my Master, to be naked at all times with dignity, to develop my full potential to please my Master, and to surrender my will to my Master." I am not exactly sure what "naked at all tines" means, because everyone is wearing clothes most of the time.<br><br>Also in my spare time, I read another excerpt from the &nbsp;<i>Slave’s Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>Slave’s General Behavior</i></em></strong><br><br>Slave discipline and effectiveness is built on the foundation of obeying orders.<br><br>Slaves must obey, immediately and without question, orders from the Master or a higher-ranking slave. Slaves who fail to obey the Master or a higher-ranking slave risk consequences. Slaves can disobey at their own risk. They can also obey at their own risk. An order to commit a crime is unlawful, except for public nudity under the auspices of the Master.<br><br><ol type="1"><li>The slave shall love the Master and only the Master. No other love interests can be pursued or allowed.</li><li>The slave shall persistently strive to reshape slave’s body, mind, and spirit according to Master’s desires. The slave shall alter the slave’s actions, words, and virtual dress to show her ownership to her Master. Slave shall always speak of and to the Master in love and respect, and address Him as "Master."</li><li>The slave shall strive to learn how to increasingly please the Master, and shall gracefully accept any discipline and criticism in whatever form Master chooses.</li><li>The slave shall not hide anything or have any secrets from Master or Head Slave.</li><li>The slave shall honestly answer, to the best of the slave’s knowledge, any and all questions Master or the Head Slave may ask her. The slave shall freely tell the Master or Head Slave anything they should know about her.</li><li>While in the same room as Master, slave shall ask permission to leave the room.</li></ol><br><br>I did not know about the last one and am glad I read it today. Every time I have been with Master, he always left the room before I wanted to. Also, I wonder why it says VIRTUAL dress. I turn a few pages to the requirements for apprentice slave:<br><br><strong><em><i>Apprentice Slave Requirements</i></em></strong><br><br><ol type="1"><li>Serve as a recruit slave for 30 days.</li><li>Perform general housekeeping duties including but not limited to:</li><li><ol type="a">Clean the bathroom and kitchen.</li><li>Vacuum all carpets.</li><li>Wash all windows.</li><li>Dust all furniture.</li><li>Wash dishes.</li><li>Do Master’s laundry.</li><li>Take out garbage.</li><li>Retrieve mail in the nude.</li><li>Clean swimming pool and Jacuzzi.</li><li>Wash and wax vehicles.</ol></li><li>Pass the nudity final examination for apprentice slave.</li><li>Complete the apprentice slave initiation ceremony.</li></ol><br><br>One day, Sara asks me to help her with the gym equipment. The Master is on a business trip. Katherine, Jackie, and Linda are off campus running errands. She also asks me to run the treadmill for a few minutes to make sure it is in good working order.<br><br>"slave Marissa, I need to fetch some cleaning supplies from the utility room. I shall return shortly."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>I wipe off the treadmill machine, then turn it on. All of a sudden it stops working. I check the plug, and it is plugged in. What happened?<br><br>Sara returns with a mop and bucket and a tube of epoxy glue and notices I am having trouble with the treadmill machine.<br><br>"What’s wrong, slave?"<br><br>"I don’t know. I turned it on, and it worked just fine for a minute or two, then just quit."<br><br>Jackie tries to turn it on and also checks the plug.<br><br>"You broke it, didn’t you?"<br><br>"No, Mistress, I did not do anything."<br><br>"Well, it’s not working now, and you were the only one in the room when it happened. It’s your fault."<br><br>"No, Mistress. Not me."<br><br>Her face shows anger; and I am feeling very helpless. "You are going to have to be disciplined for breaking the machine, and you are going to be disciplined now."<br><br>"Please Mistress. We should wait for Master and Katherine to return."<br><br>"They are not here. I am the superior rank. That makes me acting head slave, which gives me the authority to discipline slaves as I see fit. Follow me!"<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>I begrudgingly follow her out to the tool shed. She grabs a rake, then I follow her out to the first hole of the golf course.<br><br>"Take off your clothes."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>Here we go with the nudity thing again. I take off my clothes and drop them on the grass. Sara hands me the rake. I hold it vertically in my left hand so the tip of the handle touches the ground and the rake’s teeth are at the top. Sara picks up my clothes and hangs them on the rake. She then asks me to hold out my right hand to her. She opens the tube of epoxy glue and squeezes some of it onto the palm of my hand, then places my hand on my hip.<br><br>"Do not under any circumstances move a single step from this spot until I tell you. Do not drop the rake on the grass, and do not let your clothes fall off the rake. Stand up at all times. If anyone asks what you are doing here, sing to them the little teapot song. Do you understand, slave?"<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>Sara then walks away leaving me standing naked on a putting green with a rake and my clothes hanging from it. My hand is stuck to my hip. I must look absolutely ridiculous. Is this discipline really consistent with the rulebook? I wonder.<br><br>Before long, a maintenance man comes by to mow the lawn. Wearing blue overalls, he does not look too bright and wishes he could be somewhere else until he sees me. He drives one of those huge lawn mowers you sit on. My face gets really warm. I am so embarrassed, every bone in me tells me to run away from this man, but I cannot disobey an order from a superior. As he drives closer to me, he tells me to get out of the way so he can mow.<br><br>I begin to sing, "I’m a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle; here is my spout. When I get all steamed up, hear me shout just tip me over and pour me out."<br><br>The lawn mower guy just laughs and shakes his head. "The boss sure hires some strange people." He mows around me then moves onto the next hole.<br><br>After about an hour, the sprinklers turn on. Instinctively I want to get out of the way, but Sara told me not to move, so I get a free shower. Unfortunately, so do my clothes. Now I must really look stupid with dripping wet hair and dripping wet clothes.<br><br>I have no idea how much time has passed. The sun continues to move and begins its descent. It must be getting close to dinner time. My stomach is growling. I am also starting to get tired from standing so much. I am tempted to sit down but don’t really want to get into any more trouble than I am already in.<br><br>Off in the distance, I see someone coming. It’s Sally! Maybe I can get this whole thing resolved.<br><br>"slave Marissa? What in the blazes are you doing out here?"<br><br>I begin to sing again, "I’m a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle; here is my ..."<br><br>"Sara put you up to this, didn’t she?"<br><br>"Yes Mistress. Sara told me to stand here like this. How did you know?"<br><br>"She did the same thing to me when I was a recruit, except I was a church. You know, this is the church, this is the steeple, open it up, and here are the people. She glued my fingers together, so I could not separate my hands. Are those your clothes on the rake?<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Sally sighs, smiles, and says, "When slaves are disciplined, they don’t sing out here like an idiot. Put your clothes on and come into the house. You skin is getting red."<br><br>"I can’t, Mistress."<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"My hand is glued to my hip. It’s stuck."<br><br>"Well, let’s get you unstuck. Come on."<br><br>Finally, I can get out of this stupid situation. Sara is going to get it for abusing me like this.<br><br>I put the rake away in the tool shed, grab my clothes with my left hand, then quickly catch up with Sally. We both walk to the fitness room and turn on the treadmill machine. It starts right up. Sara enters the room and starts laughing.<br><br>"Did you enjoy your tea at the golf course?" Sara says with a snicker.<br><br>"Yea, a real nice time thanks to you!" I reply with an angry tone.<br><br>Sara continues to laugh and walks out. I am ready to punch her lights out. Sensing my anger, Sally stops me from doing anything rash.<br><br>"slave Marissa, fighting Sara is not worth it. You can get into some real trouble with Master if you are caught fighting. The way to get back at her is to outperform her as a slave. You can get revenge another time and another place. She did the same thing to me when I was a recruit. She is just mean that way."<br><br>Sally gets a butter knife from the kitchen and pries my hand off of my hip. Pieces of glue remain on my palm and hip. It takes over a week for me to get it all off. When I put my clothes on, I feel a sting on my shoulders.<br><br>"Ouch."<br><br>Sunburn. Just great.<br><br>After a while I do calm down, but someday Sara is going to get what she deserves.<br><br><i>Current rank: Recruit Slave</i>`

                    content: `One day, Katherine asks me to take a walk with her in the garden after dinner. She has actually been very nice to me over the weeks. She is firm but fair and always makes sure she does not give me anything to do way past my limitations.<br><br>"slave Marissa, how do you feel about living here so far?"<br><br>"Well, Mistress, I like it here more than when I first came." And the food is pretty good. Linda is a good cook. I mean Mistress Linda is a good chef."<br><br>"I noticed that you and slave Sally have hit it off. Are you getting to be friends?"<br><br>"I like being around her. Yea, I guess so."<br><br>"Is there anything you don’t like about living here?"<br><br>"Well, it would be nice to sleep in something softer and not in a cage." I choose not to mention my teapot incident with Sara.<br><br>"That will come to you in time."<br><br>Katherine is almost talking to me like a friend or even a big sister. She really wants to know how I feel about living here. She has had this attitude almost since the first day we met. I am comfortable around her and almost consider her a mentor. Our little walk eventually ends up around to the front of the mansion, Katherine casually asks me to take a quick naked run around the block.<br><br>Except for retrieving the mail weekly, I have never stepped outside the grounds since coming here. "What did you say, Mistress?"<br><br>"Run around the perimeter of the estate nude."<br><br>Oh great. Just as I was getting used to the whole mailbox chore, now I have to go even further.<br><br>"Mistress Katherine, this property is almost 100 acres. Are you sure?"<br><br>"slave Marissa. I like you very much. You have been an eager-to-please slave. I believe you want to stay here longer, don’t you?"<br><br>"Yes, I do."<br><br>"Your 30 days are up. Today is the last day of your trial period. You have a choice. You can either go out and run around in the nude or you can grab your luggage from the storage shed, change back into your regular clothes, and be on your way."<br><br>"Has it really been 30 days already?"<br><br>"Yes it has." Katherine says with a very soft and warm voice.<br><br>Thirty days goes by so fast.<br><br>"To make sure you don’t cut corners, we have asked the other slaves to post themselves with flashlights at key locations around the perimeter of the property. You must be seen by each flashlight in order to pass the test. One time we had a slave cut a corner and try to get back on the premises too soon. I almost kicked her out for trying to cheat, but she pleaded me with me so much that I allowed her take the test again later that night."<br><br>Just like before, I have to decide. I have been so preoccupied with chores, rules, nudity, and getting back at Sara, that I really have not had a chance to search for work or housing elsewhere. Slaves here get paid with room and board but not money. I am still flat broke. Unlike the mailbox test, it does not take me long to decide that I will make the run.<br><br>"Mistress"<br><br>"Yes, slave."<br><br>"I’ll do the run. I want to stay."<br><br>"I’m glad."<br><br>As I am stripping down, Katherine tells me that no slave has ever failed the test for promotion to apprentice, except for the cheater that one time, of course. Her point is that no one has ever gotten caught or lost or injured or chickened out. Somehow I found her words encouraging as I shiver from the night air.<br><br>"You can start at any time." Katherine explains.<br><br>I take another deep breath and head out the gate. This time I don’t even take an initial look to make sure I am not being seen by a pedestrian. I suppose the darkness and getting used to the mailbox errand has gotten me used to that. For no apparent reason, I turn right and not left and begin my streak. I hope that was okay, because Katherine did not say which way to go. Oh well. It’s too late now. Affluent neighborhoods like this don’t have any streetlights, so it is very dark, which is a double-edged sword in this situation. No one can see me, but I cannot see where I am going, either. Once I get going my body feels good against the night air. My size B breasts are bobbing to and fro, and the soles of my feet feel like they are on fire. I feel leaves and twigs under my feet. They pinch and poke, but I don’t care and keep going.<br><br>This property sure is big. I have been jogging now for at least ten minute and have yet to turn the first corner. I hope I did not miss it. After another five minutes or so, I see a flashlight off in the distance. Is it one of ours, or is it a stranger? As I approach, I can see the white ruffled trim of a maid outfit. It’s Linda standing on a ten-foot ladder leaning up against the fence from inside the estate. Yes, I am on track.<br><br>"Hi, Linda."<br><br>"Hi slave Marissa. Keep going. You are doing just fine." Linda cheers like a football coach.<br><br>I turn the corner and keep jogging. One wall down, three to go. Feeling better about the run, my nerves calm, and I try to relax as I place one foot in front of the other. I hear a car coming from behind me. It sounds like it might be about fifteen seconds away. Ten seconds. The trees and street in front of me begin to light up from the upcoming headlights. Five seconds. I duck behind a tree as the car zips by and does not stop. I don’t think he saw me. As I rise and begin walking, I see two red car lights heading away from me. I have just dodged my first bullet as a streaker. I approach the next corner but don’t see a flashlight. I am sure I did not cross a street. I must still be on the perimeter of the property. Well, I am not 100% sure. It is dark after all. I suppose there is a chance I could have missed it. I begin to panic, and my heart skips a beat. Am I lost? What do I do? Shall I go back?<br><br>A brief moment of bravery enters my mind, so I softly speak to the fence, "Hello? Is anyone there?"<br><br>Silence.<br><br>I try again. "Hello."<br><br>More silence but then a voice is heard from the fence.<br><br>"Shine it!"<br><br>"Okay okay. Get off my case."<br><br>I hear Sally telling Sara to shine the flashlight. What a relief. The welcomed glow of a flashlight at eye level hits my face.<br><br>"Thank you, Sally."<br><br>"Hey there, Marissa. You are welcome. Good luck." Sally says enthusiastically.<br><br>With renewed confidence, I take off again down the third wall. Before I know it, I see Maria casually playing with her flashlight up on the ladder. Her naked body can be seen from the street. I stop for a moment.<br><br>"Maria, you should be careful with that flashlight. People can see you." I warned.<br><br>"Oh no, no one can see me; it’s too dark." Maria replies like she does not care and keeps waving her flashlight around.<br><br>As I turn the corner I think Maria, you are going to get in trouble some day for being naked so much. I am now on the home stretch, the last wall. Looking to my right over the fence, I can see the upstairs lights through the windows of the mansion. I have a pretty good idea where I am now. I am going to make it. Yea!<br><br>Splat! Ouch! My right foot hits something solid causing me to fall to the ground. My toes are sore from the hit, and my knee is scraped. My chin is also a little sore, but my hands absorb most of the fall before my chin hits the pavement. I lay there a moment to catch my breath and let the pain subside. I feel my sore parts. Nothing is broken, just some scrapes and bruises I think. Serves me right for not paying attention to where I am going.<br><br>As I sit on the cold cement, I realize that I did not address any of the slaves by their titles. I just used their names. In all the excitement I just forgot and ran on instinct. I wonder if I’ll be disciplined for that. There is nothing I can do about it now. What’s done is done. Right now, I have to get back to the front gate.<br><br>I get up and limp the rest of the way. No one is in sight, so I don’t worry about being seen. I approach the front gate and find that Katherine, Linda, Sally, Maria, Jackie, and the Master are all waiting for me with big smiles. I cannot help but smile, too.<br><br>"You made it. You made it." Katherine shouts.<br><br>A few slaves applaud.<br><br>Once I step through the gate, Katherine gives me a big hug. Her warm skin feels good against my chilling body. I also hug Sally and Maria. I did not realize it at the time, but their clothes sure felt weird when I hugged them.<br><br>As a group we all walk to the back of the property.<br><br>"Aren’t we going inside?" I ask.<br><br>"No, we are not done yet. It’s time for the ceremony." Sally explains.<br><br>I have just had the run of my life, and now there is more. Everyone is wearing clothes except me and Maria. Right now I just want to go inside, take a hot shower and crawl into my cage.<br><br>We walk past the golf course to an area of the property I have not yet been. It’s a small clearing with trees all around. Leaves litter the grounds. An oak podium and small pedestal are in the back. You can hear the chomping of leaves as people walk through the clearing and take their places in a circle. Jackie strikes a match to light a pile of wood in the center of the clearing. Soon a nice campfire lights the area. The warmth feels good on the front of my body, but my buttocks are still freezing. I stand opposite the podium and pedestal. Looking around, I see all the slaves wearing their spiffy maid uniforms. It’s amazing how they never wrinkle or dirty. I don’t know how they do it. Mine seems to get dirty and wrinkled every day. Even Maria is wearing hers. It’s the first time I have ever seen her wear clothes. It looks good on her. I could have sworn she was naked at the front gate. When did she have time to put on her clothes? Holding a black plastic box with buttons on it, Master takes his place behind the podium and speaks.<br><br>Master: "Welcome to the ceremony for slave promotion. Tonight we celebrate the arrival of a new apprentice slave. I will now ask the head slave to introduce the new apprentice candidate. Slave Katherine, please introduce the candidate."<br><br>Katherine: "I bring to you slave Marissa."<br><br>Master: "Slave Katherine, Has slave Marissa fulfilled all the necessary requirements for apprentice?"<br><br>Katherine: "Yes, she has, Master. This slave came to us a month ago and has not only fulfilled the requirements for apprentice but also performed her duties well."<br><br>Master: "slave Marissa."<br><br>Marissa: "Yes, Master."<br><br>Master: "Sacrificing all you material possessions signifies that you are willing to pledge all that you are to me. Are you willing now to shed all your material possessions to join us?"<br><br>Give up all my possessions? Everything I own is in those two suitcases I brought with me. It isn’t much.<br><br>Marissa: "Yes, Master."<br><br>Master: "Slave Katherine, please present the candidate’s material possessions."<br><br>Jackie and Sara leave the circle and return with my two suitcases and my white maid uniform.<br><br>Master: "slave Marissa, throw all of your material possessions into the fire."<br><br>My Master has just ordered me to surrender the last of my worldly possessions into a great bonfire. I suppose there is no turning back now. From now on, I own nothing except my body, and even then it really belongs to my Master. I open up a suitcase and start throwing my clothes in: blouses, jeans, socks, bras, panties, T-shirts, swimsuit, belts, scarves, hats, nylons, and shoes. I do the same with the second luggage. Finally my entire maid uniform with frill, stockings, knickers, petticoat, and shoes are thrown in. I lift the empty suitcase and motion to Katherine if I should throw them in, too. Katherine says no, so I put it back down. When I am finished, I stand up and return to my place in the circle.<br><br>Master now presses a button on his plastic box, and in an instant, all the maids’ uniforms disappear leaving the slaves naked! My jaw drops to the ground. How did he do that? How can he just make clothes disappear? The slaves don’t flinch and don’t look surprised at all of what just happened. Looking around, I see most of the slaves wearing those triangle-shaped covers over their pussies. Only Sally has her chastity belt on. I am still wearing nothing, not a pussy shield nor a chastity belt.<br><br>Master: "slave Marissa, You are being admitted to my estate in recognition of your potential for hard work and your desirable personal traits. This ceremony also serves as a reminder to each slave to continue to strive for excellence, thereby bringing credit to herself as well as pleasure to me. Slave Marissa, your body, mind, and spirit belong to me now. Your genitals also belong to me now. In order to protect them, we are now giving you a gift to not only serve as a means to protect them but also to symbolize your permanent desire to stay here. Slave Jackie, the ropes. Slave Katherine, the belt."<br><br>Jackie and Katherine move away to perform their duties. I hear a rope lowering towards me from above. It’s a half-inch thick rope with a couple of loops tied at the end.<br><br>Master: "Place your hands through the loops."<br><br>I comply. Slowly, Jackie is cranking some sort of winch. The rope tightens around my wrists and rises. Soon my feet are dangling two feet off the ground. Katherine presents Master with a chastity belt. From what I can tell in the dark, it looks identical to Sally’s.<br><br>Master steps from behind the podium with the belt, walks up to me, bends down, and runs the belt up my legs. He wraps the belt around my waist and tightens it. Then he lowers the pubic shield and the bar down my crack so they meet at my crotch and locks them together in place. It’s a perfect fit. Master then nods to Jackie to lower me. My feet are on the ground again. Master undoes the ropes from my wrists, then walks back to stand on the pedestal.<br><br>He grabs the remote control, and presses another button. All the slaves are wearing their uniforms again, even me. Mine is yellow, like Sally’s, the uniform of an apprentice slave. But it does not feel right. In fact, it does not feel at all. I cannot feel my dress. It still feels like I am not wearing anything, except the chastity belt. I raise my hands to my chest to feel the dress, but all I feel is my skin! What kind of a dress is this?!<br><br>Master: "slave Marissa, as an apprentice slave, you must recognize the authority of me and the other Mistresses. Come and kiss the feet of all who are superior to you."<br><br>Katherine motions me to come kneel before the podium. I bend down and kiss Master’s feet. He gets off the podium, then Katherine stands on it. I kiss hers, followed by Jackie, Linda, Sara, and Maria. Except for the Master’s feet, my lips feel like they are kissing skin and not leather. I do not kiss Sally’s feet, because we are now the same rank.<br><br>Everyone returns to their places in the circle.<br><br>Master: "This concludes the ceremony for slave promotion. Everyone give a round of applause to our new apprentice slave."<br><br>Everyone turns to me and applauds and cheers. For the first time since my family died, I now feel like I am a part of this one.<br><br>After putting out the campfire, we all head back to the house. I still feel naked, and my feet can still feel the ground. It looks like I am wearing shoes, but I can still wiggle my toes freely and feel every pebble I step on. When we return to the house, we enter the family room. Linda prepares hot cocoa and tea for everyone. I sit on the sofa sipping my mug of cocoa. Jackie grabs a first aid kit and tends to my scraped knee. Sally sits next to me with earl gray tea.<br><br>"Mistress Sally, tell me about these dresses. Are they real?" I ask.<br><br>"No, they’re virtual." She explains. "The pussy shields and chastity belts do more than just protect your pussy. They are also electronic storage devices and holographic projectors. I don’t completely understand how they work, but they are really cool, don’t you think?"<br><br>"So you are saying that we are not wearing any clothes. I still feel naked."<br><br>"That’s right. You are still naked. We all are. The only people who wear clothes are the Master, recruit slaves, and a few maintenance guys. The slaves all "wear" virtual clothes. The shields and belts project a dynamic, three-dimensional image of clothes over our bodies using a divergence of light rays and some optical illusion. We are not wearing clothes; we just LOOK LIKE we are wearing clothes. The chastity belts that you and I are wearing only have one outfit in them, the apprentice maid uniform. When a slave gets promoted to the pussy shield, she can be downloaded additional outfits into the shield from the Master’s computer."<br><br>"Like Linda’s chef outfit and Jackie’s jujitsu uniform." I add.<br><br>"Exactly."<br><br>"But they look so convincing. When someone twirls, it looks like the skirt swooshes to the twirl with her. And when I press down on my shoulder like this, the puff actually bends in as if my hand really is touching it.<br><br>"Amazing, isn’t it? Built-in gesture recognition devices sense our movements, and the clothes react accordingly. See the USB port on the shield?"<br><br>I look at Maria’s shield. Maria is sitting in an easy chair next to us with lemon tea. She hears our conversation and turns to show me her pussy shield.<br><br>"Yes, I see it."<br><br>I had never really paid attention to the details before. I did not feel like staring at everyone’s pussy.<br><br>"The USB port is what the Master uses to give you virtual clothes from his computer. Our chastity belts don’t have a USB port, so we only have the one outfit."<br><br>I turn to Maria, "Mistress Maria, why don’t you ever project virtual clothes?"<br><br>I don’t know. I just like going naked. Besides I don’t have to worry about using batteries."<br><br>"Batteries? What batteries?"<br><br>Sally responds, "Both the belts and shields run on batteries. See the little compartment above the USB port?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"That’s the battery compartment. The batteries look just like watch batteries. Master gives one out to each slave every Saturday morning as long as we perform our duties to his satisfaction. He’ll give additional batteries as a reward for exceptional performance. It’s important to have a supply of batteries on hand. Without them, they don’t work and no virtual clothing is projected. You will appear naked to the world."<br><br>"How long do they last?"<br><br>"It depends on the virtual outfit you are running. For example, a string bikini does not take up much power, but a Victorian dress would use a lot. Katherine’s uniform uses a little more than our maid uniforms, because her skirt is full length. For our apprentice maid uniforms, if we ran it continuously, the battery might run out in about 60 or 70 hours."<br><br>"Is that all?"<br><br>"That’s all."<br><br>"But that is not even a full week."<br><br>"Yep. That is why it is important to only project virtual clothes when you have to, like when you are on duty or when guests are here. You will want to keep it turned off when sleeping or taking a shower."<br><br>"How do we turn it off?"<br><br>"There is a control switch down in the dungeon. I can show you where it is and how to use it. You can also just take out the battery."<br><br>When Sally mentions the dungeon, I realize how late it is getting and yawn.<br><br>"Mistress Sally, let’s get some sleep. I’m tired."<br><br>"Yea, me too. And by the way, you don’t have to call me Mistress anymore. We’re the same rank now."<br><br>"Oh yea, you’re right. Duh!"<br><br>We both get up and walk over to Katherine, who is talking with Master and Sara.<br><br>"Mistress Katherine, we are ready to go to bed."<br><br>"Okay, I will meet you down there in a minute."<br><br>"Master, may we be excused?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes, you may, and congratulations again."<br><br>"Thank you, Master."<br><br>Sally and I head to the dungeon, where she shows me the control panel mounted on the wall. She explains and demonstrates, "Stand with your belt close to this optical reader, then press this red button. You have to make sure the built-in fob is close enough to the reader." Her dress disappears leaving her only with her chastity belt. "Now you try."<br><br>I do the same thing, and my dress disappears, too.<br><br>Katherine walks downstairs ready to lock us up. As she is locking Sally into her cage, I head to mine, but Katherine stops me.<br><br>"slave Marissa. Over here."<br><br>She motions me to another larger cage, the same size as Sally’s and right next to hers.<br><br>"A new cage?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes, you’re an apprentice now." She answers.<br><br>With enthusiasm, I enter my new cage. It’s seven cubic feet larger than my old one. A month ago I never thought I would be so excited to sleep in any cage let alone a bigger one.<br><br><i>Current rank: Apprentice Slave<br>No. of batteries: 1<br>No. of virtual outfits: 1</i>`

                    content: `Wearing my chastity belt takes some getting used to. I have to be very thorough about cleaning it. Without towels, I cannot wipe away moisture. Sometimes I get a rash around my waist, and have to use baby powder. I have to push harder to get my stool out when defecating. Looking down into the toilet bowl, I can see my logs sliced neatly in half by the bar running down my crack. I have to use twice as much toilet paper, because I have to clean both my anus as well as the bar.<br><br>I read more parts of the <i>Slave's Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>Apprentice Slave</i></em></strong><br><br>Apprentice slave is your first step into long-term subservience. Your duties will continue in general housekeeping. Nudity is now required in all duties and responsibilities. However, your chastity belt comes with one virtual maid outfit.<br><br><strong><em><i>Care and Maintenance of Chastity Belt</i></em></strong><br><br>Your chastity belt is custom-made of stainless steel and neoprene to fit comfortably. Accurate measurements of your body were taken from your physical examination. Take care to clean parts of the belt that are in constant contact with the body. During periods of long-term wear, a typical belt should be removed regularly to clean off accumulated skin, urine, and other deposits; however, under the rules of the Master, you cannot take off the chastity belt for any reason without the Master’s or Head Slave’s consent. Please check regularly for bruising, edema and chafing where the device contacts the skin and be vigilant against pressure sores. If you need to remove or adjust it, please see either the Master or Head Slave, who can help you. Do not under any circumstances ...<br><br>That’s enough of me reading about chastity belts. Let’s get to something more interesting. I turn a few pages and read.<br><br><strong><em><i>Discipline</i></em></strong><br><br>The slave agrees to accept any discipline the Master decides is required. Such discipline shall be explained as to infraction committed, the timetable for discipline and the lesson that said discipline will hopefully teach. Below are some sample guidelines of infractions and appropriate disciplines:<br><br><table><tr><th class="column-1">Infraction</th><th class="column-2">Discipline</th></tr><tr><td>Not mopping the kitchen floor well enough</td><td>10 lashings on the buttocks with a flogger</td></tr><tr><td>Burning dinner</td><td>no meals for the next 24 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Wearing real clothes (apprentice and above)</td><td>25 lashings on the buttocks with a cane</td></tr><tr><td>Leaving a room without Master’s permission  </td><td>Inverted suspension for 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Removing the chastity belt without consent</td><td>Mandatory nudity for two weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Removing the pussy shield without consent</td><td>Demotion to apprentice slave</td></tr><tr><td>Failure to obey a direct order (first two offenses)</td><td>25 lashings on the buttocks with a cane</td></tr><tr><td>Failure to obey a direct order (third offense)</td><td>Excommunication</td></tr><tr><td>Lying or Stealing (first two offenses)</td><td>Loss of two batteries and 50 lashings on the buttocks with a cane</td></tr><tr><td>Lying or Stealing (third offense)</td><td>Excommunication</td></tr><tr><td>Refusing to accept discipline</td><td>Excommunication</td></tr></table><br><br>In addition, all infractions result in surrendering a battery except where stated above for multiple batteries. If slave has no batteries at time of discipline, a negative battery count ensues. The slave cannot have any batteries until she earns enough back to reach 0 count.<br><br><strong><em><i>Excommunication</i></em></strong><br><br>A slave who commits a serious offense or refuses to accept discipline may be excommunicated from the estate at the Master’s discretion. Excommunication means that once the slave is removed from the estate, neither the Master or any other slave may speak to her or acknowledge the slave’s existence if they ever come into intentional or inadvertent contact with excommunicated slave in the future. If the Master or any slave is asked by an outside party if they have any past relationship with ex-slave, the Master and slaves would deny any knowledge or relationship of that slave. The severity of excommunication varies depending on the slave’s rank at termination:<br><br>Recruit Slave-The slave must return her maid uniform. All her clothes and possessions that she carried with her into the estate are returned to her. She shall be led to the front gate where she shall walk out.<br><br>Apprentice Slave-The slave’s chastity belt is removed. She will be given a lingerie or teddy resembling a French maid, then led to the front gate where she shall walk out. She shall have no other material possessions, such currency, clothes, identification, electronic devices, purse, passport, or any means of transportation.<br><br>Third Class Slave-The slave is given no material possessions (same as apprentice). Her pussy shield is removed. She is absolutely naked and shall be led to the front gate where she shall walk out.<br><br>Second Class Slave-same as third class slave except that she shall be blindfolded and taken to an undisclosed remote location not closer than 50 miles of the estate and abandoned.<br><br>First Class Slave-same as third class slave except that she shall be place in a state of unconsciousness and taken to an undisclosed remote wilderness area of a foreign country and abandoned.<br><br>Head Slave-same as first class slave<br><br>If a slave is demoted, then later excommunicated, the severity of excommunication is at the slave’s highest rank ever obtained. For example, if a slave is promoted to first class, then demoted to third class, when she is excommunicated, she shall be excommunicated as if she is a first class slave.<br><br>If the ex-slave is seen trying to re-enter the estate, the authorities shall be called. In all likelihood, she shall be arrested for trespassing and, depending on her state of dress (or undress), indecent exposure.<br><br>I turn a few pages.<br><br><strong><em><i>Third Class Slave Requirements</i></em></strong><br><br><ol style="1"><li>Serve as an apprentice slave for at least six months.</li><li>With prior approval of the Master or Head Slave, learn the basics in three specialty areas. Below are examples. Other areas can also be used to fulfill this requirement and can be developed as the needs of the household determine.</li><ol style="a"><li>Cooking -- satisfactorily cook 2 breakfasts, 3 lunches, and 5 dinners from the Master’s Cookbook.</li><li>Gardening</li><li>Automotive Technology (oil and filter change, inflate tires, radiator power flush, air filter change, change spark plugs)</li><li>Massage-12 classes</li><li>Jujitsu (yellow belt)</li><li>Golf-grounds maintenance and 12 golf lessons</li><li>Ballroom Dancing (basic step and three patterns in the following dances: waltz, tango, foxtrot, cha cha, rumba, samba, swing)</li></ol><li>Pass the same fitness test for recruit slave. (Must be taken six months or later from date of nudity final examination for recruit slave)</li><li>Pass the nudity final examination for third class slave.</li><li>Complete the third class slave ceremony.</li></ol><br><br>The rulebook also discusses batteries, which Sally told me about last night.<br><br>With guidance from Master and Katherine, I choose my three specialty areas to fulfill the third class slave requirement: cooking, gardening, and ballroom dancing. I take cooking because I did that professionally in my last job, and gardening is just an excuse to hang out with Sally more. Katherine tells me to try ballroom dancing. I would not have chosen that one by myself, but Katherine says the Master is an avid ballroom dancer and has been looking for a dance partner. Other slaves have tried taking dancing lessons, but they all have two left feet. A large ballroom with a hardwood floor is in the back of the house near the pool. The two make a great combination for large parties. But during the day, Master and I take private ballroom dancing lessons in there and practice on our own as well. An instructor comes to the mansion once a week for an hour and teaches us. At first because I did not know anything, I learn one-on-one from Johan, the instructor. He does not think it unusual for me to dance in my maid uniform. It’s the only clothes I can project. If the other slaves have taken lessons from him, then he is probably used to it by now. Later as I get more proficient, Master joins us and dances with me while Johan watches and teaches us as a couple. Master is an excellent dancer, and I enjoy his company and sense of humor when we practice.<br><br>One day, the Master asks me, "My neighbor’s pool person just quit, and they are having a pool party this weekend. He asked if he could borrow one of my staff to clean the pool for him. I thought of you, because you do such a good job. Besides I owe him a favor. Would you mind?"<br><br>"No, Master, not at all. I would love to."<br><br>Finally, a chance to get off the property. I have been stuck here ever since I arrived three months ago. Apprentice slaves don’t have the opportunity to make excursions or run errands. We only have one outfit, and a yellow maid uniform does not exactly blend in with the crowd at your local shopping mall.<br><br>Master also tells me that they have all the equipment and supplies over there. He gives me directions, and I am on my way. It’s right next door, but since the lots are so huge, right next door means a twenty minute walk. I reach the main gate of the house and ring the bell. A voice from an intercom system speaks to me.<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Hi, my name is Marissa. I work for your next door neighbor. I understand you need your pool cleaned."<br><br>"Ah yes! Please come in."<br><br>The gate begins to open automatically. As I walk to the house, a man walks out to greet me.<br><br>"Hi, I’m Steve."<br><br>"Hi, I’m Marissa."<br><br>"Thanks for coming over. Let me show you the pool."<br><br>Steve leads me around to the back. The property is not quite as big and elaborate as my Master’s, but it is still pretty nice. The pool is also smaller and not the Olympic-sized one that Master has. It’s oval-shaped and designed more for wading and playing volleyball in than swimming laps.<br><br>"You’ll find all the cleaning equipment in the storage shed over there. You have experience cleaning pools?"<br><br>"Yes, that is why he sent me."<br><br>"Okay, Great. I am going into the house to get some work done. Holler if you need anything."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>Steve enters the house. I open the storage shed and start cleaning. I use the long net to scoop all the debris that fell into the pool. Then I test the pH balance with the measuring kit. It needs more chlorine, so I pour some of that in. I finish everything and decide that the pool is clean, so I put everything away and close up the shed. When I walk back to the pool, two more leaves have fallen in and are floating just out of arms reach. I don’t feeling like going all the way back to the shed to get the net, so I try a shortcut. I lean over as far as I can and paddle the water with my hand to try to get the leaves closer to me, or at least closer to an edge of the pool. This does not work very well, and I lose my balance.<br><br>Splash! I fall into the pool. At first I get angry at myself for being so awkward, but then figure it is no big deal, because I am really naked anyway. I will just get out of the pool and air dry myself. The virtual maid uniform should still appear dry. After I climb out, I pull my wet hair out of my face and over my shoulders. I happen to see myself in the reflection of the sliding glass door of the house. To my shock, except for the chastity belt, I appear naked!<br><br>My heart stops beating for a moment. How can I look naked? What happen to the appearance of my maid uniform? It’s supposed to be working. The battery could not have run out. I have not used that many hours on it. I start to breathe heavily and panic. I am away from my Master’s property and am near someone who might not know about my lifestyle. What would he think? He cannot see me like this. It’s too embarrassing. I cover my private parts with my hands and try to figure out how to cover myself.<br><br>Over by the garbage bins, I see a large empty cardboard box labeled, Acme Dishwasher. Steve must have recently bought a new dishwasher, and this is the box that came with it. I punch the bottom out and put myself in it. In a panic, I start running towards the front of the property and out the front gate. I am now on public streets in broad daylight wearing nothing but my chastity belt and a box. I don’t think; I react. I sprint like crazy back to my Master’s estate. I don’t know if anyone is looking at me and don’t bother to turn my head to check. All I am focused on is getting home.<br><br>The run was probably only five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity. I ring the doorbell of the Master’s house. Waiting anxiously, Jackie comes and opens the gate for me. I dash in and breathe a sigh of relief.<br><br>"slave Marissa. What happened to you?"<br><br>"Oh Mistress Jackie. My maid uniform got turned off."<br><br>"Turned off? How?<br><br>"I don’t know."<br><br>"What were you doing?"<br><br>"I was over at a neighbor’s cleaning his pool for him. I accidentally fell in the pool. When I got out, my uniform disappeared."<br><br>"Ah ha! I think I know what happened."<br><br>"You do?<br><br>"Yes, when you fell in the pool, your chastity belt short circuited, causing it to stop projecting an image."<br><br>"No, that can’t be. I have swam and showered with the belt all the time. It never broke then."<br><br>"That was here, though. Not outside."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"All the water in here is specially treated. When our shields (or belt in your case) come in contact with water here, it does not get damaged. Out there, certain chemicals can really mess it up, chlorine especially."<br><br>"Oh great. Just great."  I have just damaged my chastity belt. What are Master and Katherine going to think? I’ll probably get disciplined for this.<br><br>Master walks towards me and Jackie. "slave Marissa, I just got off the phone with Steve. He says you did a fine job cleaning the pool, but he did not have a chance to thank you or say goodbye. Why are you wearing that cardboard box?"<br><br>I step out of the box and explain all that had happened.<br><br>Master all of a sudden gets a serious look on his face. "Come with me."<br><br>"Yes Master." I follow him into the house and into his office. Master’s office is twice as large as Katherine’s. One wall has a library full of science and engineering books. Another wall is filled with diplomas, certificates, and patent awards of inventions I cannot pronounce. Hanging on the wall is a 27″x40″ oil painting of Katherine in the nude. Showing her body from the knees up and wearing her pussy shield, she is sitting on a stool with a dignified yet seductive pose. Master sits behind his desk. I just stand there in front of him.<br><br>"slave Marissa. Wearing clothes is an infraction of the rules. Even a cardboard box is considered clothing."<br><br>"But I was off campus with nothing to wear."<br><br>"It does not matter. You could have used the telephone to call us. One of us could have driven over to pick you up."<br><br>"But I didn’t want Steve to see me naked."<br><br>"A little embarrassment never hurt anyone. Knowing Steve, he probably would have enjoyed it. You are going to have to be disciplined."<br><br>My heart sank. Is he going to send me down to the dungeon and torture me, demote me back to recruit, or even excommunicate me? This is turning out not to be a good day.<br><br>"Discipline will be ten hits on your behind with a cane and loss of battery. Sentence will be carried out after dinner. It’s only your first infraction. Consider yourself lucky. Dismissed."<br><br>"Yes Master."<br><br>I leave his office partially relieved. I guess I can live with a sore buttocks and some nudity. At least I am still living here and still an apprentice. Then it just occurs to me, how do I get my chastity belt repaired? Shall I go back into Master’s office? Better not. He does not seem like he is in a good mood. I’ll ask Katherine or Sally later.<br><br>That afternoon, I find Katherine and desperately ask to speak with her.<br><br>"Would you like to speak to me here or in private?"<br><br>"In private, please."<br><br>"How about my office?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>In Katherine’s office, I tell her all that had happened: cleaning the neighbor’s pool, falling in, the short circuit, the cardboard box run, and Master’s discipline decision. Katherine listens to my every word and can tell I am worried.<br><br>"Are you worried about tonight’s discipline after dinner?"<br><br>"Yes, that and how I am going to fix my chastity belt."<br><br>"I think the discipline is fair. Master has set rules in the house that we must all follow. He is actually letting you off a little easy. The rulebook says 25 lashings for wearing clothes. You’re only getting 10. All of us have had sore bottoms some time during our stay here, but we all live through it."<br><br>I start to cry. Grabbing a facial tissue, Katherine gets up from behind her desk, walks over to me, and takes my hand. She wipes away my tears and gently speaks to me. "It will be all right."<br><br>"Will you come with me to the discipline in the dungeon?" I plead.<br><br>"Yes, we all have to be there to watch."<br><br>Katherine unlocks my chastity belt and says that she shall have it repaired as soon as possible. In the mean time, I have no choice but to walk around the house stark naked.<br><br>After dinner, everyone heads down to the dungeon for my big event. Master kindly explains to everyone what happened and why I am being disciplined. He tells me to lean over the horse. The horse is an A-frame wooden structure with heavy padding at the top. Attached near the bottom of its four legs are leather cuffs to put hands and feet through. Scared stiff, I do as I am told. Jackie and Katherine lock my hands and feet in place. I am still naked. My buttocks are sticking up near the top of the horse. Except for my head left dangling upside down, I am unable to move.<br><br>Master takes an oak colored wooden cane from the rack. He strokes my buttocks with his hand then says to me, "After I smack you, slave Marissa, you must say the number of the smack and ‘thank you, Master.’ Do you understand?"<br><br>"Yes Master."<br><br>"Then let’s begin."<br><br>Smack!<br><br>"Ow! One. Thank you, Master."<br><br>Smack!<br><br>"Ow! Two. Thank you, Master."<br><br>Smack!<br><br>"Ow! Three. Thank you, Master."<br><br>There is a slight pause. Why isn’t Master hitting...<br><br>Smack!<br><br>"OUCH! Four... Thank you, Master."<br><br>And on it went up to ten. When it is over, Jackie and Katherine release me from the horse. Everyone either goes back upstairs or to the basement. Katherine and Sally stay with me a while for moral support.<br><br>"You did well." Katherine encourages.<br><br>"Yes, and you lived through it." Sally says.<br><br>"How does my butt look?" I ask.<br><br>"You’ve got some welts, but they probably look worse than they feel." Sally explains.<br><br>"When you have a chance, take a look in the mirror." Katherine says.<br><br>"Thank you for staying with me, both of you. It means a lot."<br><br>"Anytime." Sally replies.<br><br>My discipline does not really end with the caning. Since my chastity belt is broken, I have to go around stark naked for the next few days. My buttocks still show the welts, which I am very self-conscious of. It may be just my imagination, but I keep thinking everyone is looking at them and thinking what a bad slave I am. I also have to remember to sit down slowly. I am the only one in the household truly naked. Master and maintenance men wear clothes; the slaves wear a pussy shield, except for Sally who wears a chastity belt. They may be sort of naked, but they can at least appear to be wearing clothes. Maria is the only one who looks naked, but at least she has her pussy shield.<br><br>I return to my Slave’s Rulebook and reread the section on Care and Maintenance of Chastity Belt:<br><br>...If you need to remove or adjust it, please see either the Master or Head Slave, who can help you. Do not under any circumstances immerse the belt in water outside the estate. If the chastity belt comes into contact with any outside water sources, the belt will most likely short circuit. All water in the estate has been specially treated to not damage the chastity belt. This includes showers, swimming pool, Jacuzzi, water faucets, and urine.<br><br>I skipped this section earlier and now regret it.<br><br>On the third day of my enforced nudity, Katherine comes into the library where I am dusting, and hands me my chastity belt.<br><br>"All fixed, slave Marissa."<br><br>"All fixed? Really, Mistress?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Can I put it on?"<br><br>"Yes, you may. There is no battery in it, however. Master took it away as part of the infraction. You’ll have to wait until Saturday to get a new one."<br><br>"Okay. Thank you, Mistress."<br><br>"You are welcome."<br><br>I take the belt, put it on, and lock it in place. It’s better than nothing. At least my pussy is covered.<br><br><i>Current rank: Apprentice Slave<br>No. of batteries: 0<br>No. of virtual outfits: 1</i>`

                    content: `Over the next few weeks I make it a point to accumulate spare batteries. All the other slaves do, for they know that discipline can come at any time. Having a spare battery or two can save a lot of humiliation and inconvenience. Maria is the champion of battery-collecting at 15 batteries! I only keep my chastity belt turned on when I am on duty and during meals. Occasionally, Master will have guests over, and I have to be clothed in their presence to entertain them. Over the next few months, I receive a new battery each week with the previous one having anywhere between five to seven hours left. Over time, I manage to collect four spare batteries.<br><br>Infractions do happen and not just to me. Sally let some roses out front die, and Master disciplined her for that, five lashings, one for each dead rose. Linda overslept and was 20 minutes late with breakfast. She got 20 lashings, one for each minute. Even Mistress Katherine was not above the rulebook. A window had trouble opening and closing and eventually got stuck open, so it needed to be repaired. Katherine waited two days before calling the repairman. Master took away her battery and made her stand naked and handcuffed to the tool shed for an entire night. A maintenance man finally saw her the next morning and released her. At least she didn’t get her buttocks whipped.<br><br>Another excerpt from the <i>Slave's Handbook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>Nudity</i></em></strong><br><br>The Master enjoys seeing his slaves in the nude and takes pleasure in knowing that none of them wear clothes. He wants all his slaves to be comfortable and enjoy being nude. Therefore, all slaves (except recruits) are required to be nude at all times. Wearing real clothing is never an option under any circumstance and carries discipline if this infraction occurs. See section on Discipline.<br><br>Nudity promotes honesty and self-dignity. The feeling of being nude let’s your senses know that you cannot hide anything. Honesty is always the best policy and having an atmosphere of open and honest communication is the strength to any good relationship. Self-dignity also comes from within you and not through wearing clothes. Women who wear clothes feel that they have self-dignity. However, their clothes could be taken away from them at any moment (by a rapist or in a medical emergency for example). Remove a woman’s clothes and you remove her dignity is how the saying goes. However, women who can learn to be dignified without clothes will always be dignified whether they have clothes on or not. Not wearing clothes also lightens your load and increases range of motion, enabling you to stay in physical shape and improve work performance. Nudity is pure, healthy, and natural.<br><br>Our society has not yet embraced the concept for nudity for all people. Thus, the virtual clothing you project enables you to conform to and function in the outside world. In mind, body, and spirit, however, you know you are nude.<br><br><strong><em><i>Nudity Final Examinations</i></em></strong><br><br>The promotion system enables you to decrease your gymnophobia and increase your comfort level in the nude in a series of increasingly challenging examinations. Although complete comfort as a nudist is never truly obtained, the journey of pursuing your honesty and self-dignity through this lifestyle is really what is important.<br><br>Recruit Slave-Retrieve the mail just outside the front gate.<br><br>Apprentice-Run around the entire perimeter of the estate.<br><br>Third Class-While blindfolded (or placed in the trunk of a car), be taken to a remote wilderness area not less than five miles away and abandoned there with no material possessions, except the chastity belt. The chastity belt shall have no battery. The slave shall be picked up 24 hours later at the same spot.<br><br>Second Class-same as third class, except the drop-off and pick-up spots shall be a distance of not less than two miles, and the pussy shield shall have no battery. Thus the slave must free hike from the drop-off to the pick-up point.<br><br>First Class-same as second class, except that there is no pick-up. The slave shall return to the estate using her own means.<br><br>Before an exam, the slave cannot:<br><br><ul><li>Know or attempt to know the location of the exam (third class and above)</li><li>Call someone to assist her during the exam</li></ul><br><br>During an exam, the slave can:<br><br><ul><li>Ask someone (not from the estate) for assistance. This can be done by asking a passerby in person, or calling on the telephone.</li></ul><br><br>During an exam, the slave cannot:<br><br><ul><li>wear clothes</li><li>remove the pussy shield/chastity belt</li><li>call the estate for assistance (before the allotted time for second class and below) or receive aid by a another slave</li><li>violate a rule in this rulebook</li><li>get arrested</li></ul><br><br>Otherwise, the slave fails the exam. If the slave violates a rule, discipline will be enforced as usual. Calling the estate for help or getting arrested results in no infraction. Taking a more challenging exam above your challenge rank is not allowed but will enable you to pass the exam. For example, if an apprentice slave is taking the third class exam and successfully runs home on her own, the slave will only get promoted to third class. The slave still needs to take the second class and first class exams later for promotion to those ranks.<br><br>"Are you ready to take the test for promotion to third class?" Katherine asks.<br><br>"I don’t know, Mistress."<br><br>It’s a big jump from apprentice to third class. In the first two exams, I was pretty close to the estate. I am supervised and could chicken out at any time. And the exams didn’t take all that long. But it’s a lot tougher for third class. You have to be completely abandoned miles from here. You don’t know where you are, and there is no backing out once they drive away. You’re stuck out there nude for an entire day. Lots of things can happen in 24 hours--bad things.<br><br>"Mistress, there is no time limit for being an apprentice slave, is there? I mean for recruit, I had to promote to apprentice by 30 days. But for, third class, I can take my time, right?"<br><br>"Yes, that’s right. You can stay as an apprentice for as long as you like and live here for years that way. But slave Marissa, wouldn’t you rather sleep on a nice soft mattress instead of being locked in a cage every night? You could get up during the night and use the bathroom anytime you wanted instead of holding it until we let you out of the cage. And wouldn’t you rather wear a compact pussy shield instead of that bulky chastity belt? Wouldn’t you like to be able to project other outfits beyond the maid uniform and make trips to the shopping mall?"<br><br>"I guess so."<br><br>"Well, then I would like to see you get promoted."<br><br>"I have to think about it some more."<br><br>"Okay, let me know."<br><br>I leave Katherine’s office feeling dejected. I have been here for almost ten months and still have not taken the third class nudity exam. I have fulfilled all the other requirements but just can’t come to grips with being helplessly naked and abandoned for that long. Sally and I are the same rank, so that night as we are locked in our cages we talk.<br><br>"Sally, how come you haven’t taken the third class exam yet? You’ve been here longer than I."<br><br>"I don’t know. I guess I really haven’t thought about it."<br><br>"Hasn’t Katherine asked you about it?"<br><br>"Yea, a couple of times, but my mind gets preoccupied with other things. Why do you ask?"<br><br>"Katherine wants me to take the third class exam."<br><br>"And you are reluctant, I take it."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You know what we should do, Marissa?"<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"We should take the exam together."<br><br>"Can we do that?"<br><br>"Let’s ask Katherine tomorrow."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"You know, Marissa, if we take the test together, pass it together, and promote together, we can still be roommates. If only one of us passes, the other person would be in the dungeon by herself."<br><br>The next day, Sally and I both go to Katherine with our request.<br><br>Katherine explains, "No, I am afraid you cannot be out there in the woods together. The whole point of the exam is to prove your self-reliance as a naked woman."<br><br>My heart sinks.<br><br>"However, what I can do," she continues, "is to abandon both of you at the same time but in different places. You would be taking the exam together but will have no contact with each other the entire time."<br><br>"But isn’t that the same as being alone?" I ask.<br><br>"Sort of. You would each know that there is another naked woman out there going through the same thing you are going through. In that sense, you are not alone."<br><br>I am still reluctant. It sounds like the same deal to me, but Sally holds my hand and thinks otherwise.<br><br>"Come on, Marissa. We can do this." Sally says with encouragement.<br><br>"I just don’t know." I slowly say.<br><br>"If you both pass, you can go through the slave promotion ceremony together. That we can do." Katherine explains.<br><br>"What do you say?" Sally asks.<br><br>Sally has a tremendous look of anticipation in her eyes. Perhaps that is the final straw that got me to agree to take the exam.<br><br>"Excellent!" Katherine exclaims, "The test will begin tonight after dinner. Jackie will drive Marissa, and I will drive Sally to her spot. You will each be in totally different parks. I don’t think they are even under the same government jurisdiction levels, so don’t even try looking for each other."<br><br>"Yes, Mistress." We say in unison.<br><br>I am sitting blindfolded in the front seat of the minivan. Jackie is driving me to my third class exam. I am projecting my maid uniform, the only thing I can "wear." Jackie is projecting a pink tank top, blue jeans, and sandals.<br><br>"...and above all don’t panic. If you see someone coming, just get out of their way and stay hidden." Jackie explains.<br><br>I appreciate Jackie sharing her experiences and advice with me. I really have not had a chance to get to know her as well as some of the other slaves.<br><br>When we reach the park, Jackie comes around to the other side, and helps me out of the minivan. I am still blindfolded and can smell the sweet scent of pine needles. She then guides me like a blind person to my final spot where I will spend the next 24 hours.<br><br>"Okay, slave Marissa. You may now remove your blindfold."<br><br>I take off the blindfold to see nothing but a lot of trees, bushes, and Jackie. I hand her the blindfold. It is dusk.<br><br>"Your battery, please."<br><br>I open up my battery compartment. As soon as I pop out the battery, the projection shuts off. My naked body is now exposed.<br><br>After I hand Jackie my battery, she says "I chose a nice remote spot for you. No one should bother you here. I am sure you will do just fine and pass with flying colors. See you tomorrow."<br><br>"Bye"<br><br>Jackie then walks away down a trail. I am now completely alone. It’s the first time I have been alone since I left my apartment ten months ago. From then until now, someone has always been telling me what to do, where to go, what to eat, when to sleep, what to wear or project. Now there is no one to tell me anything.<br><br>I start looking around and notice that near me is a campground with some picnic tables, barbecue grill, latrine, campfire area, and water pump with drinking fountain. No one is there, and it’s nice to now I will be able to have water during my ordeal. The dusk continues to darken and the temperature cools. My hands and feet start to get cold, but I don’t seem to mind. I am too preoccupied at the moment with how I am going to survive this. Before it gets too dark, I decide to walk around, making careful note where Jackie left me, so I know where to return.<br><br>The campground is near a trail, which I start walking on. I walk in the direction that Jackie went, hoping to figure out how far away the parking lot is. I get about 100 yards when I start hearing people talking and coming towards me. I can also see a couple of flashlights. People are coming! I immediately turn around and jog back along the trail. I go a little further pass the campground I started from and find a place to hide along the other side of the trail. The trail now separates me between the campground that I was near. I don’t want to get too far away from my starting point, because I might get lost. I duck behind a bush. As bad luck would have it, the people stop at the campground that I need to be in for my pick-up. Oh this is just wonderful. Not only have they taken my spot, they have also taken my drinking supply.<br><br>Four men, three women, and two others (either teenagers or young adults--a boy and a girl) make up the backpacking party. They take off their backpacks and start making camp: pitching tents, lighting the campfire, etc. They seem to be having a good time. Laughter is in the air.<br><br>I decide to move a little further away. If I can see them, there is a slight chance they could see me. All they would have to do is shine a flashlight in my direction. I try to listen to their conversations but cannot make out much. Only when one of them shouts can I understand what that person is saying. From what I can tell, it’s all small talk and nothing I would be interested in anyway. I can see a faint glow of a campfire, which reminds me how cold I am getting. It’s much warmer in the valley where the mansion is. Up here in the woods, the nights get colder. I wish I could join them and stand next to their campfire. I wonder what they would think of me if I revealed myself to them: a naked woman wearing a chastity belt running around in the woods with no camping supplies. Very strange indeed. They would probably think I need mental help. I am sure it would be an experience they would never forget. But I decide not to. I am not that desperate for help--yet.<br><br>Eventually the campers quiet down and go to sleep in their tents. I stand to stretch my legs, for I have been squatting for at least an hour or two. The wind picks up, so I wrap my bare arms around me in a futile attempt to stay warm. I look up to see a million stars in the night sky and for a moment feel very tiny and vulnerable in this great big Milky Way galaxy. I also think about Sally, where she is, and how she is getting through her test. Is she as cold as I am? Has anyone seen her naked? I wonder.<br><br>Some time during the night I somehow doze off and later wake up to the sound of the campers. The sun is also rising and starting to warm me up. I also smell food: eggs and bacon. Oh bacon! I could sure use something to eat and wish I could ask them for some food.<br><br>Ever so slowly, they break camp, put on their backpacks and continue down the trail. Alone again at last. I enter the campground to see if they left anything, but it turns out they were environmentalists. They left no traces. At least I am able to get a drink of water, which I take. Drinking the water actually makes me feel hungrier, because now that my thirst is quenched, the hunger pains are more evident.<br><br>The rest of the day has fewer incidentals. Every couple of hours or so, a hiker or jogger passes by on the trail, but I make it a point not to be so close to it. I also look around a little beyond the perimeter of the campground but nothing is to be seen. Most of the time I am within line of sight of my pick-up point with Jackie.<br><br>As dusk approaches again, my anticipation grows. Hurry up, Jackie, and come rescue me. A small part of me thinks, what if Jackie does not come for me? What would I do? Would I have to face the ridicule of some campers that I ask for help? Would they be humanitarians and help me or throw stones at me and label me a pervert? But Jackie does come. As she approaches the pick-up point, I walk over to meet her. Jackie smiles when she sees me.<br><br>"Hi there, slave Marissa."<br><br>"Hi Mistress Jackie. It’s so good to see you. You have no idea how relieved I am to see you. I thought you might not come back."<br><br>"Oh I definitely was planning on coming back. We’ve never abandoned a slave during a third class test or second class for that matter. We only do that for first class."<br><br>"Can we go now?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes we can. Here is your battery."<br><br>I take it from her and pop it back into my chastity belt. The projector starts up again with an image of my maid uniform. I am legally decent again. Hurray!<br><br>Jackie and I walk the trail together back to the minivan. I was only five campsites in from the trailhead, a short 15-minute walk. On the way home, I do not wear a blindfold, so I can see where I was. It was a long, long way from home. Getting back on my own would have been impossible!<br><br>When the minivan pulls into the driveway, Sally runs towards me. I get out, and we give each other the biggest hug ever. "WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT!" we shout.<br><br>"Okay calm down, you two." Katherine admonishes, "We are not done yet. We still have the promotion ceremony."<br><br>I was so relieved to finally finish the test and getting home, I forgot all about the ceremony.<br><br>"Katherine continues, "Go down to the basement and get cleaned up. The ceremony starts in fifteen minutes. After that, you can go to the kitchen where Linda has dinner waiting."<br><br>"Dinner!" I shout.<br><br>Oh, I wish Katherine did not mention dinner. She just reminded me how hungry I am. I have eaten nothing since dinner yesterday.<br><br>Sally and I take a nice hot shower and dry ourselves off. The warmth of being indoors plus hot water and hot air make me feel alive again.<br><br>Feeling anew, Sally and I walk into the dungeon where the Master and all the slaves are waiting. All the slaves are projecting their maid uniforms, even Maria.<br><br>"Ah, there you are." Master exclaims, "Now we can get started."<br><br>Everyone is in a circle with an opening big enough for two more to join. Sally and I take our places.<br><br>Master: "Welcome to the ceremony for slave promotion. Tonight we celebrate the promotion of two new third class slaves. I will now ask the head slave to introduce the candidates. Slave Katherine, please introduce the candidates."<br><br>Katherine: "I bring to you slave Sally and slave Marissa."<br><br>Master: "Slave Katherine, Has slave Sally fulfilled all the necessary requirements for third class?"<br><br>Katherine: "Yes, she has, Master."<br><br>Master: "Has slave Marissa fulfilled all the necessary requirements for third class?"<br><br>Katherine: "Yes, she has, Master."<br><br>Master presses a button on the remote control. All the slaves appear naked again. He then presses another button, and Sally and my chastity belts fall apart and drop to the floor. Looking down, the chastity belts are in three pieces each. Sally and I are stark naked. For Sally I think this is the first time she has ever had her belt off in a whole year.<br><br>Master: "slave Sally."<br><br>Sally: "Yes, Master."<br><br>Master: "and slave Marissa."<br><br>Marissa: "Yes, Master."<br><br>Master: "You have both demonstrated self-reliance in the outside world. For that you shall each be rewarded with a new chastity device. You are both being recognized for your hard work and self-reliance. This ceremony also serves as a reminder to each slave to continue to strive for excellence, thereby bringing credit to herself as well as pleasure to me. Your genitals continue to belong to me. In order to protect them, we are now giving you a gift to not only serve as a means to protect them but also to symbolize your permanent desire to stay here."<br><br>Master: "slave Jackie, the suspension cuffs. slave Katherine, the shields."<br><br>Jackie and Sara leave the circle. Jackie presses a button on the wall. A motor begins running that lowers a chain with a two-foot long spreader bar attached to the end. On each end of the bar is a thick leather strap designed for putting your feet through.<br><br>Master: "slave Sally. Lay face up in the middle of the circle."<br><br>Sally: "Yes, Master."<br><br>Once Sally lies on the floor, Jackie puts each foot through the leather straps, then tightens them.<br><br>Jackie pushes another button on the wall, and the motor starts again. This time the chain goes up and Sally along with it. When it stops, Sally is hanging upside down with her head about two feet from the ground. Her arms are dangling on the floor. Her legs are spread apart exposing her crotch. Jackie takes two leather cuffs and puts each of Sally’s hands in them and buckles them snuggly. She then runs a rope from the D-ring of each cuff to an eyebolt anchored to the floor, then ties knots and tightens them, so that Sally’s arms are outstretched. Sally is now in an inverted spread eagle position.<br><br>Katherine presents the Master with a pussy shield and various piercing devices.<br><br>Master then walks directly in front of Sally. His face is a vertical two feet away looking down at Sally’s pussy.<br><br>After cleaning her pussy with an antiseptic wipe, He makes three piercings: one on each corner of her groin area and a third on her crotch. He runs the rings from the three corners of the triangle into the piercings, then uses small ring closing pliers to close the rings.<br><br>When he is done, he signals Jackie to lower Sally back down. Sally is released. Katherine cleans the piercing equipment. Now it’s my turn.<br><br>Master: "slave Marissa. Lay face up in the middle of the circle."<br><br>Marissa: "Yes, Master."<br><br>The same procedure is done to me. Aside from a yoga class in high school, I have never been inverted before. The blood immediately rushes to my head. My head feels like it will explode, but that feeling soon subsides, when I feel a pinch similar to a bee sting on my groin. Ouch! Then another on the other side. Ouch! I cannot see what is he is doing to me. I can only see Sally’s feet through Master’s legs. Finally, the crotch ring, which hurts the most. OUCH! It’s over, and I am let back down and released.<br><br>Returning to my place in the circle, I instinctively place my hand over the pussy shield to feel it. I also run my fingers over the ring piercings. Very tender. The underside of the shield with the neoprene lining is not flat. A bulge enters about half an inch into my vagina.<br><br>Master is now standing on the pedestal. He grabs the remote control, and presses another button. All the slaves are projecting their uniforms again. Sally and I now have red maid uniforms, the insignia of a third class slave.<br><br>Master: "slaves Sally and Marissa, as third class slaves, you must recognize the authority of me and the other Mistresses. Come and kiss the feet of all who are superior to you."<br><br>Just like before, Sally and I bend down and kiss Master’s feet and subsequently, Katherine, Jackie, Linda and Sara. Maria does not get her feet kissed, because we are the same rank.<br><br>Everyone returns to their places in the circle.<br><br>Master: "This concludes the ceremony for slave promotion. Everyone give a round of applause to our new third class slaves."<br><br>Afterwards, we all head upstairs for cake and ice cream. The cake reads, "Congrats to Sally and Marissa." In the corner is a drawing made of icing of a red maid uniform. A grand dinner is also waiting for Sally and me: turkey with gravy, mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots, and fresh cranberry sauce. Yum! As we are eating dessert, Sally and I trade stories and share with interested slaves about our experiences in the woods. I mention the campers; Sally not only mentions her campers but her daring theft of food.<br><br>"Sally, you mean to say you snuck into the campground and stole a candy bar?" I inquired.<br><br>"Yes, they left one out by mistake. Believe me, if I did not take it, the raccoons would have later. Better me to have it than them."<br><br>"So you got a free candy bar. I am jealous. I didn’t get anything to eat at all."<br><br>"Yea, but it was kind of risky. I could have been caught, too."<br><br>That night for bed, Katherine shows us the mattresses we will be sleeping on in the basement.<br><br>"No more cages for you. Third class slaves get to sleep on mattresses."<br><br>"All right!" I respond with joy. "Where do we get sheets?"<br><br>"You don’t get any sheets." Katherine answers. "Sheets are a privilege for second class and up."<br><br>I look around and sure enough, Maria just has her mattress, but Linda and Sara each have sheets and pillows with their mattresses. I never noticed that before.<br><br>"Good night" Katherine says.<br><br>"Good night, Mistress." We all say.<br><br>I lie on my mattress and feel like I am in heaven. Even without sheets, it feels so soft and comfortable to sleep on a bed again. Before I know it, I am asleep.<br><br><i>Current rank: Third Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 1<br>No. of virtual outfits: 1</i>`

                    subtitle: "Grocery Store Incident", 
                    content: `Another excerpt from the <i>Slave's Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>The Slave's Oath </i></em></strong><br><br>I, {name}, give body, mind, and spirit to the servitude of my Master, to be naked at all times with dignity, to develop my full potential to please my Master, and to surrender my will to my Master.<br><br>The Slave's Oath consists of three points: body, mind, and spirit, all three of which belong to the Master.<br><br>Your physical BODY belongs to the Master. He considers the pussy area the most sacred part of the female body. Therefore, the chastity belt/pussy shield serves to not only give you virtual clothing but also protects against anyone or anything trying to access the pussy. Only the Master may have access to your pussy. Slaves are not allowed to own anything including their bodies. Body does not just refer to the slave's physical body but also includes all physical possessions. The Master owns anything given to you. You are merely a steward of the item, which must be used directly or indirectly for the Master's benefit. See Nudity section for more information.<br><br>A slave is admitted, because she carries in her MIND certain skills, abilities, and talents which the Master finds beneficial to his well-being. Using these traits to the best of your abilities and to the fullest potential pleases the Master the most.<br><br>SPIRIT is the essence of who you are and what motivates you to do what you do. When you surrender your will to the Master, your will is no longer your own. Your sole purpose in life is to please the Master and nothing else. Everything you do, every thought you have should be in the interest of pleasing the Master.<br><br>I turn a few pages.<br><br><strong><em><i>Third Class Slave </i></em></strong><br><br>As a third class slave, your duties are expanding beyond general housekeeping. Your pussy shield gives you more virtual clothes as your time, duties, and responsibilities increase. Depending on what virtual clothing you are given, you will be allowed to leave the property to run errands and enjoy outings with the Master or at least under the supervision of one or more first class slaves. Third class slaves sleep on mattresses with no sheets or blankets in a basement next to the dungeon.<br><br><strong><em><i>Pussy Shield </i></em></strong><br><br>Similar to the chastity belt, the pussy shield is also made of stainless steel and lined with neoprene. The pussy shield comes with three piercing rings, which signify the three points of the Slave's Oath. The USB port is your gateway to the outside world. At his discretion, the Master uploads virtual clothing outfits into the pussy shield via the USB port, so that you may go into the outside world appearing as if you are fully clothed.<br><br>Care and maintenance should be followed just like the chastity belt. Body piercings take time to heal, even with diligent care. Expect some time for normal healing. Clean each piercing twice per day for at least nine months and daily in the shower thereafter.<br><br>Watch for signs of infection (increased redness, tenderness, heat, or swelling). If you have any problems or concerns concerning the pussy shield, please talk to the Master or Head Slave. If necessary, they will ensure that you get proper medical treatment.<br><br><a href="https://writingsofleviticus.grometsplaza.net/Chuppecatnutter/pussyshield01.jpg" target="_blank" style="font-family: inherit; font-style: italic; color: inherit;">Illustration</a><br><br>No more skin rashes from that bulky chastity belt. No more baby powder. And best of all, defecating is so much easier. The logs slip right out, and I don't have to use as much toilet paper. I am so excited to be a third class slave that I decide to project my uniform almost 24 hours a day. About the only time I don't have it on is when I am showering, because I need to see what I am washing. Predictably, the battery runs out, and I grab one earned from my apprentice slave days. Unfortunately, the new battery does not fit. I compare the old one with the new and discover that they are different sizes. The one for the pussy shield is slightly smaller. In a bit of a panic, I run upstairs and find Linda, who explains to me.<br><br>"slave Marissa, the batteries for the chastity belt don't fit in pussy shields."<br><br>"But I collected all these batteries when I was an apprentice slave." I plead.<br><br>"Those are only good for chastity belts back when you had one. You have to start collecting new batteries. The good news is that you get to keep the same pussy shield all the way to first class. As you promote, any batteries you accumulate will still be good."<br><br>"Yes, but that does not help me now. I have no batteries and look naked."<br><br>"Sorry."<br><br>I try to exchange them for pussy shield batteries, but Katherine says no go. In fact, Sally and I were required to turn them in during the slave promotion ceremony, but Master forgot to mention it. Sadly, Sally and I relinquish all our chastity belt batteries to Katherine. I now have no batteries and must appear naked until Saturday when I pick up a new one, and I must start all over again collecting them.<br><br>With discipline and determination over the next couple of months, I do collect new batteries back up to four.<br><br>On a sunny Sunday afternoon, I see Katherine relaxing by the pool in a lounge chair, reading a book. I know her pussy shield is turned off, because she is naked. I also notice that she only has one breast. Her right one is gone. Also naked and not having anything to do, I sit next to her.<br><br>"Hi Mistress."<br><br>"Hi slave Marissa. How are you?"<br><br>"I am fine. And you?"<br><br>"I am fine, too. I am just enjoying the sunshine."<br><br>After a brief pause, she asks "Is there something you needed from me?"<br><br>"Well, I happen to notice. I mean, well, I guess I have never seen anyone with only one breast before. I'm curious as to what happened."<br><br>"I had breast cancer in my right breast and needed to have it removed."<br><br>"Oh, I'm sorry."<br><br>"That's all right. It's in remission now. I have not had any signs of cancer for the past four years."<br><br>I think for a moment then respond with "Interesting."<br><br>"What is?" she asks and smiles.<br><br>"Well, Master seems to enjoy having beautiful women with perfect bodies around. No offense, but I am surprised he chose you to be here. I mean don't get me wrong, you are very pretty, but don't a lot of men prefer women with two breasts?"<br><br>Katherine puts her book down and begins, "When I was 20 years old, I was a piano performance major in college under a full scholarship. I was also just diagnosed with breast cancer but had no health insurance. The medical bills were mounting, and I was afraid I would run out of money and die. During one of my piano recitals at the school, a man in the audience was impressed with my playing abilities. He came back stage after the recital to meet me and ask if I would do a private recital for him and a few of his business associates at his home. He offered a very large sum of money that I could not refuse, because I knew I would be able to pay some of my medical debts. I did the recital, and he asked me to come back to play for him on a regular basis for a modest but steady income. My hope of surviving came back, because I knew I would be able to get chemotherapy and be rid of this cancer. Over time, we got to know each other, and he learned of my medical condition. He offered to pay all my medical bills if I would become his slave. He would also allow me to complete my degree and play the piano for him. He saved my life, and I am his first slave."<br><br>"What a story, Mistress! I had no idea you were his first slave, but I have never heard you play the piano."<br><br>"Oh, I play sometimes. I used to play a lot, but then he hired other slaves and got busy. He needed someone to manage the household while he went off on business trips, and I got the job. I get so busy managing the place that I don't often get a chance to play."<br><br>"What about going nude?"<br><br>"Nudity came later. He was curious to see what my breasts looked like during chemo treatments and before and after the mastectomy, so I showed him. He enjoyed looking at me naked so much, he required all slaves to be naked. Some slaves abided by that decision; others left. Over time, we established a hierarchy, promotion, reward, and discipline system for all slaves to keep the organization in order."<br><br>"And the pussy shields?"<br><br>"The Master is a brilliant engineer and inventor. He decided that it was too much trouble commanding the slaves to put their clothes on only to have them take them off again moments later, so he invented the pussy shield. I was his first guinea pig and wore the prototype. At first the virtual clothing was very simple: a one-piece solid-colored swimsuit for example. More elaborate clothes came later. Designing virtual clothing has its challenges, such as creating a skirt with shadows in the pleats, but it's these fine details that make clothes look three-dimensional and demonstrates just how brilliant the Master really is. He created the illusion of us standing in high heel shoes without wearing any shoes. He made it look like the frill in our hair is actually standing up. It also malfunctioned a lot, and I cannot tell you how many times the thing failed in the middle of a recital or a night on the town. I have had to walk out of restaurants and theaters many times wearing my Master's trench coat with my Master apologizing profusely to the management. But eventually, he perfected it, and now we have what we have."<br><br>"So, Mistress, you have had your share of embarrassing moments, too."<br><br>"Oh yes indeed." She replies and nods.<br><br>"Yours is gold; everyone else's is silver."<br><br>"Yes, only the head slave gets a gold shield. It carries three times the memory capacity of a silver one. It's one of the perks of being head slave."<br><br>"You must have a lot of virtual outfits."<br><br>"I've got a few." She modestly says.<br><br>I am in the kitchen helping Linda prepare lunch, when Katherine comes in with two women wearing white maid uniforms.<br><br>"slave Bethany and slave Deanna, this is slave Linda and this is slave Marissa."<br><br>"Hello" come from Bethany and Deanna.<br><br>"Bethany and Deanna have just arrived and are our newest recruit slaves." Katherine explains.<br><br>"Please to meet you." I reply.<br><br>"Hi there." Linda says.<br><br>Bethany is a tall one at 5' 10" but thin. She has neck-length brown hair and brown eyes. Deanna is 5' 3" 115 lbs. and has long dark brown hair and brown eyes. Her white uniform top, however, appears to carry a lot of cleavage.<br><br>That night when I am lying on my mattress, I hear whimpering from the dungeon. I get up and walk over to find Bethany in her cage sobbing away. Deanna is fast asleep in hers. I bend down to Bethany's level.<br><br>"slave Bethany, are you all right? What's wrong?"<br><br>"I'm claustrophobic. I want out." She sobs.<br><br>"I am sorry, but I don't have the key."<br><br>"I didn't know they were going to make me sleep in a locked cage. I don't like it here. I want to go home."<br><br>I reach through the bars and take Bethany's hand. "Bethany, it's going to be all right. You will get used to it. Let me stay with you."<br><br>Bethany seems to stop sobbing a little and tightens her grip on my hand. After a while, she finally falls asleep.<br><br>The next morning, I find Bethany sitting at the breakfast nook.<br><br>"Thank you for helping me last night, Mistress Marissa."<br><br>"You are welcome. Glad to help." I respond.<br><br>"Help with what?" Sally asks.<br><br>"Oh, Bethany and I talked a little last night about some things. That's all." I say nonchalantly.<br><br>During breakfast, it occurs to me that Bethany called me Mistress. I realize that I am no longer the lowest ranking slave in the house. I like this feeling.<br><br>After breakfast, Master asks me to come to his office. My gut reaction is what did I do wrong? But it is just the opposite.<br><br>"slave Marissa, you have been doing good work here. I noticed that the grounds look great, the swimming pool is always clean, and the meals even taste better ever since you have been helping slave Linda in the kitchen."<br><br>"Thank you, Master. I aim to please."<br><br>"Come closer."<br><br>I walk up to his desk. He leans over and sticks a USB cable into my pussy shield. The other end of the cable is attached to his laptop computer. He begins typing. After a few minutes, he disconnects the USB cable from me, then presses a button on his remote control. I look down and see myself projecting a yellow short-sleeve polo shirt, white crop pants, and white lace-up sport shoes. Master has awarded me with my first casual virtual outfit that is not a maid uniform.<br><br>"Master, this is beautiful. Thank you so much."<br><br>"You are very welcome, slave. Keep up the good work."<br><br>"Can I go now?"<br><br>"Not yet. Please sit on my lap. I would like to talk."<br><br>I sit on Master's lap behind his desk, and we talk. He tells me how much he cares for me and thinks about me. I give a classic pat answer response similar to "I bet you say that to all the slaves." He says that is mostly true. Nevertheless, he cares for each slave dearly. He has an excellent memory and always follows through on any concerns we tell him or indirectly tell him through Katherine. He asks me to come even closer. I lean down to his face, and we kiss. He places one hand on my breast the other on my buttock. After a few minutes we amicably separate.<br><br>"Master, I really need to get back to work. Can I go now?<br><br>"Yes, you may. Take a look in the mirror when you have the chance to see your new virtual clothes."<br><br>"Okay, Master. Thank you again."<br><br>When I leave his office, I head straight to the basement where there is a full length mirror near the bathroom. It looks good on me.<br><br>Sally later shows me how to cycle through from a casual outfit to my maid uniform to no clothes at all. Standing in front of the same control panel and optical reader in the basement, Sally presses the same red button but holds it down this time. Each second, her virtual clothes keep changing and cycles through in a certain order. She only has two outfits, her maid uniform and a causal outfit. Thus, her virtual clothing cycle is maid uniform, casual clothes, no clothes, maid uniform, casual clothes, no clothes, etc. After three cycles, she releases the button stopping the cycle at no virtual clothes.<br><br>"So that is how you change clothes." I respond.<br><br>"Yes, either that or the Master's remote control. That thing can change your outfit at our Master's will."<br><br>I also figure out that whatever outfit I am projecting when I take my battery out is the same one I project again when the battery is put back in.<br><br>Linda asks me to go with her to the supermarket to help buy groceries. This is my first outing with my new casual outfit. Linda is also casually dressed in a green t-shirt, white Capri pants, and tennis shoes, all virtual of course. When we reach the market, I grab a shopping cart while Linda pulls out a shopping list out of her wallet. We begin going up and down the aisles filling the cart as we go. About half way through the store, Linda says she needs to use the ladies room and asks me to take over for her. She hands me the list and wallet, and I continue shopping. I find everything I need and wait for Linda. She does not come out of the bathroom. Not wanting the perishables to spoil, I go through the checkout line, pay cash from Linda's wallet, then load everything up in the minivan. Still no Linda. I head back into the market and walk into the ladies room.<br><br>"Linda, are you in here?"<br><br>I hear Linda's voice of desperation from a stall, "Marissa, is that you?"<br><br>"Yes, Linda. Why are you still in here?"<br><br>"My battery ran out."<br><br>Oh no. No wonder she is still in here. Without a battery she appears naked and cannot leave the ladies room.<br><br>"Linda, did you bring any extra batteries with you?"<br><br>"No, I left them all at home."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I thought this one had enough juice to make it to the store and back."<br><br>"Oh, Linda. What are we going to do?"<br><br>"Give me your battery." She commanded.<br><br>"No! Then I‘ll end up naked. No way."<br><br>"Well, then drive home and get me another one."<br><br>Not be able to think of another solution, I decide that was the best one. I tell Linda not to move and would be back as soon as I can. I drive the minivan back home and tell Katherine what is happening. Katherine asks Deanna, Bethany, and Maria to unload the groceries in the minivan quickly, changes her outfit to a navy blue blazer with princess seams and back vent, matching pants, striped boatneck shirt, and leather sport casual sandals, then accompanies me back to the supermarket with a spare battery.<br><br>When we pull into the parking lot, the supermarket is deserted. It is 7:30 PM, and the sign on the store window says they close at 7:00 PM. I ask Katherine what to do.<br><br>"Stay in the van." She commands.<br><br>Katherine gets out of the minivan and walks to the sliding glass door of the grocery store. She knocks on the glass and gets an employee's attention. An employee walks over and talks to her through the glass."<br><br>"Yes, what do you want?"<br><br>"I need to use your bathroom."<br><br>"We're closed."<br><br>"I know, but I really need to go badly."<br><br>"I'm sorry but store policy."<br><br>The employee then returns to her work. Katherine gets back in the minivan.<br><br>"I am afraid there is nothing we can do. Linda will have to wait until the store re-opens tomorrow morning."<br><br>"But she will be stuck in there all night." I reply.<br><br>"I know, but she is a second class slave. She can handle it."<br><br>We return to the mansion. Sally, Bethany and I all pitch in to make dinner in Linda's absence. I keep thinking about her and how she is coping with spending the night in the ladies room of a grocery store.<br><br>The next morning, Katherine and I drive back to the supermarket. The store has already been open a few minutes, and we find Linda sitting on the curb wearing sweats.<br><br>"Linda, what happened? Are you all right?" we ask.<br><br>"Yes. I am fine but a little tired."<br><br>"Where did you find those sweats?" I ask.<br><br>"They were in the store. I did not know that they sell sweats in a supermarket until I walked around."<br><br>"So you are wearing real clothes." Katherine asks.<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>The three of us get in the minivan and return home. Katherine, Linda, and I are all standing in front of Master's desk in his office. The Master is sitting down behind his desk and speaks.<br><br>"From what the three of you have told me, I find two infractions. Slave Linda, you wore real clothes."<br><br>"Yes Master." She softly says.<br><br>"slave Marissa, Linda asked you to give her your battery and you refused."<br><br>"Yes Master." I answer.<br><br>"Discipline will be carried out tonight starting with no dinner for either of you. Dismissed."<br><br>"Yes Master." We all say in unison.<br><br>Later I ask Katherine why I am being penalized for disobeying Linda's order. Katherine's response is "It would not have made any difference who was stuck in the stall naked. You could have given your battery to Linda, she could have fetched the spare battery, and you could have spent the night in the store instead of her."<br><br>"But it is not my fault that her battery ran out. She should have brought a spare."<br><br>"You're right. She should have, but the fact remains that she gave you a direct order, and you disobeyed. Besides, you could have brought along your own spare battery, and the whole incident could have been avoided."<br><br>I still don't think it is fair, but Master made his decision, and I must get disciplined.<br><br>That night Linda and I each get 25 lashings on our buttocks with the Master's cane. We also each give him one of our spare batteries. This marks the second time Master has disciplined me for an infraction.<br><br><i>Current rank: Third Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 3<br>No. of virtual outfits: 2</i>`

                    subtitle: "A Dirty Trick", 
                    content: `This week is filled with promotions and most notably an excommunication. Ten days after Deanna arrives as a new recruit, I see her walking out to the front gate with her regular clothes and luggage in hand.<br><br>"slave Deanna. slave Deanna. Where are you going? I ask.<br><br>"I'm going home, and don't call me slave. I quit."<br><br>"You're quitting?"<br><br>"Yes. This nudity thing is for the birds. You are all a bunch of pervs. I'm going home where I can wear regular clothes any time I want."<br><br>When Bethany and Deanna retrieved the mail, they were just as giddy about it as I was. I figured they would get over it. Nevertheless, I watch Deanna walk out the front gate where a taxi is waiting for her. She gets in, and the taxi drives away. I suppose this lifestyle is not for everyone.<br><br>Tonight I get to hold a flashlight at a corner of the estate to watch Bethany pass her nudity exam for apprentice slave. When she runs by, I shine the flashlight on her. This is the first chance I have had a good look at her naked body. Because of her height, she has a much longer running stride. Her breasts are about the same size as mine. But, most notable is all that brown pubic hair, which not only covers her vulva but also extends all the way up to her belly button and out to her hips. If she placed her hands over that area, it would not even cover half of all that hair.<br><br>"Nice going, Bethany! You can do it." I shout to her.<br><br>"Don't shine that flashlight on me!" She quips. "People will see me."<br><br>Without breaking stride she turns the corner and keeps running.<br><br>Master: "slave Bethany, as an apprentice slave, you must recognize the authority of me and the other Mistresses. Come and kiss the feet of all who are superior to you."<br><br>Wearing her new chastity belt, Bethany bends down and kisses Master's feet. He gets off the pedestal, then Katherine stands on it. She kisses hers, followed by Jackie, Linda, Sara, Maria, Sally and finally me. It's the first time anyone has ever kissed my feet.<br><br>Everyone returns to their places in the circle.<br><br>Master: "This concludes the ceremony for slave promotion. Everyone give a round of applause to our new apprentice slave."<br><br>Everyone turns to Bethany and applauds and cheers.<br><br>A few days later, Linda and Sara take their nudity final exams for first class slave. Sara did not seem to have much trouble and was the first to make it back in less than two hours. That's got to be some kind of record. She walked through the gate looking nude like it was a walk in the park. I only wish I have it that easy when it is my turn. Linda takes much longer, about 12 hours. A big 18-wheeler semi pulls up to the front gate. I see Linda kissing the truck driver. She gets out naked and waves goodbye to him. That guy had the biggest smile on his face. I'll bet she made his day.<br><br>The ceremony for the first class slave promotion has the same opening and closing rituals, but the middle part is different. When Linda and Sara stand in the center of the circle nude, the Master plugs a USB cable into their pussy shields and uploads the first class maid uniform from his PDA. After he turns on everyone's pussy shield to display maid outfits, Linda and Sara stand on the pedestal and bend forward. Sally, Maria, Bethany and I are required to kiss their buttocks as a token of our subservience to them. Then, they step off the pedestal to allow the Master to step on it, so that they can kneel down and kiss his feet. Like before, they also kiss Katherine's feet. Apparently, in all the slave promotion ceremonies, the slave being promoted gets her buttocks kissed by any lower ranks present and kisses the feet of all higher ranks. When Bethany and I became apprentices and when Sally and I made third class, there were no lower ranks to kiss our rear cheeks, so it did not happen. This is the first time my lips have ever touched someone's buttocks.<br><br>One of the tremendous privileges of being a first class slave is sexual intercourse with the Master. Only first class slaves and the head slave can have sex with the Master and only the Master. (Needless to say, lower ranks cannot have sexual intercourse.) After the foot-kissing is done, Katherine presses a button on the wall to lower the chains from the ceiling as in the third class ceremony. This time, two leather wrist cuffs hang together from it. Linda runs her hands through and Katherine tightens the straps. Linda is lifted a few inches off the ground. Katherine attaches a two-foot spreader bar to her feet spreading her legs apart. Master presses a button on his remote to make her appear naked, pushes a key into the lock of Linda's pussy shield and unlocks it separating the triangle from the crotch ring. He flips up the shield exposing her pussy. The Master removes his clothing and inserts his cock into Linda's pussy. We all watch the Master and Linda have sexual intercourse. After the orgasm, Master lowers the pussy shield back down to her crotch and locks it. Linda is released, and the process is repeated for Sara.<br><br>Another aspect of the first class promotion is post-ceremony festivities. First class slaves are required to show off their area of specialty during the post-ceremony party in the living room. For Linda that is easy, she has several desserts for us to try, including pecan bars, carrot cake, lemon meringue pie, peanut brittle, and crème brulee. I go straight for the white chocolate fountain, which is circled by fresh strawberries, delicious. Sara being the masseuse gives Master a leg and buttocks massage for him in front of everyone in the living room. She enjoys rubbing his rear cheeks hard. Linda receives a chef's hat as a gift from the Master, a real one, not virtual. Sara receives massage supplies, mainly various rubbing oils.<br><br>Sara, Maria and I are in town running some errands for Master: dry-cleaning pick-up, mailing packages at the post office, etc. Sara is projecting a beige long-sleeve tunic with an embroidered necklace, and crop blue jeans. Maria is projecting a white sleeveless chino dress with pleated safari-style pockets, and antique brass belt buckle. I am still projecting my one and only casual outfit. In-between errands, Sara suggests we do some shopping at a strip mall. Maria thinks it would be a good idea, so we go. Out in the parking lot, Sara pulls out a water pistol and shoots my pussy shield. It immediately short circuits. I lose the projection and appear naked in the parking lot.<br><br>"Hey! What did you do that for?" I shout.<br><br>"Just having a little fun." Sara explains.<br><br>I cover my privates with my arms and hands and try to look for cover. Sara then points the pistol at Maria. Maria gets frightened and freezes.<br><br>"slave Maria, I don't want you to be naked. Just get in the car, and we'll be on our way."<br><br>"But what about Marissa?" Maria asks.<br><br>"Marissa is going to stay and do some more shopping. Right Marissa?" Sara answers as she turns to me.<br><br>"F*%# you, Sara!" I yell back.<br><br>A man comes out of a convenience store with a soda drink and pauses to look at me. The strip mall has a small alley way between two buildings. I make a beeline dash for it. Sara and Maria continue to exchange words in the parking lot. I am too far away to hear them. Maria reluctantly gets in the car; Sara gets in the driver's side, and they drive away. My naked body is exposed in a strip mall on a sunny day with no means of transportation. People are everywhere. Panic sets in.<br><br>People are going in and out of different stores. I peek out from the alley and notice a pay phone about 25 feet away. When the parking lot is momentarily empty, I run to the phone and try dialing Master's number.<br><br>"Excuse me. Do you need some help?"<br><br>A male voice behind me speaks to me. I turn around to see a young man about 5' 8" tall, curly dirty blond hair, maybe college-aged or mid-twenties. My muscles tighten up and my hands are still in front trying to cover up. I turn my back to him and face the pay phone.<br><br>"Go away. I am trying to make a phone call."<br><br>"If you don't mind me saying that telephone is out of order."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"The phone. It's out of order."<br><br>I lift the receiver to my ear. He is right. There is no dial tone. I also look at the top of the phone box, where a handwritten piece of paper says "OUT OF ORDER." I hang up the phone and run back to the alley. He follows me but does not enter the alley and keeps his distance. He repeats his original question.<br><br>"Do you need some help?"<br><br>I feel so embarrassed but cannot deny that I need help. I look at him. Something about the expression on his face and the tone of his voice tells me he genuinely wants to help.<br><br>"Ye-Yes, I need help." I stutter.<br><br>"I have a jacket in my car. I'll go get it for you."<br><br>I cannot wear clothes, so I offer an alternative.<br><br>"Actually, can you just drive your car up to the alley? I'll just get in, and we can get out of here."<br><br>He agrees and runs to his car. A couple of minutes later, he swings around in a bronze-colored subcompact car and waits for me. Without looking, I just run to his car, open the door, and get in. I see an elderly woman with a shopping bag looking at us. Her eyes are wide open, and her jaw his halfway to the ground.<br><br>"Let's get out of here." I say to him. "Go!"<br><br>He hits the gas and squirts out of the parking lot. Soon we are on the road.<br><br>"I'll take you to my apartment. I've got some clothes there you can borrow."<br><br>"I don't need clothes. I need to get home."<br><br>As he is driving, his eyes occasionally glance down at my groin.<br><br>"That's uh an interesting triangle thing you have on your, well, you know."<br><br>I turn to him and say, "Hey look. I really appreciate you helping me out like this. I really did not know what I was going to do back there. Thanks for helping me."<br><br>"Sure thing. I am really curious though how you got out there naked in the first place."<br><br>"Can you promise to keep a secret?"<br><br>"Yes, I can."<br><br>I don't know why I trust him. Maybe it's because he got me out of a jam, or maybe it's because he has not tried to take advantage of me (if you know what I mean). He just seems interested in helping me.<br><br>"I have this electronic device on my pussy that is supposed to project a holographic image of clothes. It was working just fine at the strip mall (no pun intended), but then it got wet and short circuited. That's how I ended up naked."<br><br>"Wow, what a cool device. Do you mind if I take a look at it?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>I move my hand away and show him.<br><br>"No, I mean can we go to my place. I'd like to exam it and maybe help you fix it. You see, I am an electrical engineer, working on my master's degree. I'd love to take a look at that thing. No funny business. Honest."<br><br>I think about it while we are stopped at a red light. Can I really trust this guy? We just met five minutes ago.<br><br>I did not have to say yea or nay, because before long we end up at his apartment anyway. I look around and see no one, so I quickly get out of the car, and follow him up the stairs to his apartment. Inside, he offers me more clothes, but I decline. He then takes a close look at the shield and notices the USB port. He pulls out his laptop and runs a USB cable from my shield to his computer. I just sit there and wait for him while he stares at his screen. After several minutes, he says, "This is some really sophisticated programming that I have never seen before. I am not really sure what to do." He looks some more, then says, "Let's try this." He types some more, presses ENTER, then the bottom half of my maid uniform appears on me. I am still topless, but the skirt and fishnet stockings show. The USB cable looks like it is punching a hole through my skirt. He types a few more keystrokes, and the frill in my hair appears. He begins to get amused, like a kid with a new toy. After some more fiddling around he gets shoes on my feet, but not the ones that go with my uniform. Rather they are the causal shoes that go with my other outfit. I am beginning to look like a mismatched model. I decide that I have had enough and ask if I could borrow his phone.<br><br>"I am sorry. I should not be playing around with someone else's property. You don't have to call. I'll drive you home."<br><br>With that, he disconnects the USB cable and shuts down his laptop. I look like a topless stripper.<br><br>Placing both hands on my breasts, I get back in his car. He also gets in. I direct him to the mansion where he drives up to the front gate.<br><br>"I want to thank you again for helping me."<br><br>"You're welcome. Hey, I never got your name."<br><br>"Marissa."<br><br>"Marissa. That's a nice name. I'm George."<br><br>"Thanks again, George."<br><br>Just as I get out of his car, he hands me a paper with his phone number. I get out of the car. After Sally lets me in through the gate, he drives away.<br><br>"Who was that?" Sally asks.<br><br>"That was my friend, George. He helped me get home."<br><br>"What happened to your maid uniform? The top is missing."<br><br>"Yes, I know. It's a long story."<br><br><i>Current rank: Third Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 4<br>No. of virtual outfits: 2</i>`

                    content: `I spend an hour in the Master's office with a USB cable stuck in my pussy shield. Master runs some diagnostic programs to help fix it. When he asks me what happened, I only tell him part of the story. I tell him about the water hitting the shield but not that it came from a water pistol from Sara. I did tell him about George and the way he helped me. He seems to accept my answer, so I leave it at that. He is glad that I refused to wear any clothes, even though it was offered to me twice. He is very proud of me for making it back on my own. It's too bad it was not an official first class nudity exam. It did not qualify anyway, because I was only three miles from home, and you have to be at least five miles away according to the rulebook. It was good practice anyway.<br><br>When he finally got my pussy shield in good working order, he restores my virtual outfit to the maid uniform. Later I tell Sally the whole story. She got as mad as I did. She does not like Sara either and has had her share of practical jokes and bullying from her. I later learn that Maria kept her mouth shut, because of Sara's threats. If Maria did not conform, she would have ended up appearing naked next to me in that alley.<br><br>An excerpt from the <i>Slave's Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>Second Class Slave Requirements </i></em></strong><br><ul><li>Serve as a third class slave for at least one year.</li><li>Learn the basics in three additional specialty areas from third class slave requirement no. 2. These are in addition to the three areas you have already learned for third class slave for a total of six specialty areas.</li><li>Pass the same fitness test for recruit slave. (Must be taken one year or later from date of nudity final examination for third class slave)</li><li>Pass the nudity final examination for second class slave.</li><li>Complete the second class slave ceremony.</li></ul><br><br>I turn a few pages:<br><br><strong><em><i>Fitness Requirement </i></em></strong><br><br>The Master requires all slaves to stay physically fit. When slaves are fit, they feel better (and have better sexual intercourse with the Master when they reach first class rank). Slaves in good shape perform their duties easier and can more easily pass their nudity final exams for each rank. The Master wants all of his slaves to wake up in the morning feeling like they can accomplish anything under the Master's control, Slaves must feel strong and confident in their servitude for him. A healthy slave is a productive slave. A productive slave enables the Master to also be more productive.<br><br>All slaves are required to participate in the daily exercise routines, which serve as an excellent way to train the slave's body for endurance, increase cardio capacity, and build muscular strength.<br><br>Fitness is for the birds, I think to myself. I attend the daily exercise classes but just go through the motions. However, I always make sure I at least stay fit enough to barely pass the fitness tests for each rank, but do not feel compelled to do anymore. Jackie, the black belt instructor, is very enthusiastic about staying in shape, but I am not.<br><br>Bethany sure has been standing out by the pool for a while. Her chastity belt is not turned on, so she appears naked. I wonder what she is doing. When I walk up to her, I notice that a big black spider is drawn on her chest with a thick felt tip marker.<br><br>"Bethany, what are you doing out here?" I ask.<br><br>Bethany begins singing and doing hand motions. "The itsy bitsy spider crawled up the water spout. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. Out came the sun and dried up all the rain. And the itsy bitsy spider crawled up the spout again."<br><br>I bow my head and put my hand on my forehead knowing exactly why Bethany is doing what she is doing: Sara!<br><br>I explain to Bethany the same way Sally explained it me many months ago. Bethany did not know what to think of Sara's treatment of her but got a little angry when she figured it out later. Like when it happened to me, Bethany was also getting sunburned for standing out in the sun so long. And like the rest of us, she was glued. The soles of both of her feet were glued to the deck of the swimming pool. She could not move from that spot, even if her life depended on it. Sally and I help Bethany get unglued from the deck. We also clean the dried-on glue from that spot on the deck off before the Master and Katherine return.<br><br>Katherine is driving me to my test for second class slave. Once again I am blindfolded and sitting in the front passenger seat. Making the step from third class slave to second class slave is not that big a jump. The only difference is you have to get picked up at a different spot. Everything else about the exam is the same. As long as you don't get lost, it's no problem. When I took my third class exam, I was walking around a little anyway. Katherine makes sure I don't get lost by showing me a map of the park. First we arrive at the pick-up point and points on the map where we are. This way I recognize it when I get there and stay there. Then she blindfolds me again and drives me to the drop-off point. Again, she shows my where on the map. A series of hiking trails separate the two points on the map. It is now my job to get from point A to point B within 24 hours, and it's not a straight line. Judging by the key on the map, I would estimate three miles of hiking. It is one hour before sundown, and Katherine gives me my final instructions.<br><br>"slave Marissa. The rules require that I only stay for about 15 minutes. If I cannot find you by the end of that time, I have to leave, and you are on your own. So, it is extremely important that you be there when I get there. Do you understand?"<br><br>"Yes, Mistress."<br><br>"Okay. Good luck, and I will see you tomorrow."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>I give her my battery from my pussy shield and a hug in the car, then get out. The parking area is empty, and no one is around. Katherine drives away leaving me with absolutely nothing but a non-functioning pussy shield. I am not even allowed to have the map with me, but I did memorize which trail names to take.<br><br>With the setting sun, I don't hesitate to starting walking briskly up the first trail. Once it gets too dark to see, I will have to stop and spend the rest of the night where I stop. The more ground I can cover tonight, the less ground I will need to cover tomorrow when it is daylight. The really nice thing about this park is that there is no overnight camping. Theoretically, this means that no one should be around at night. For the third class exam, I had to stay away from those campers but should not have such a problem tonight. Once the park opens tomorrow morning, however, jogger, hikers, and equestrians will be up and down these trails, so I really need to get as close to the pick-up point as I can before they get here. Ideally, if I don't make any wrong turns, I might even make it all the way to the pick-up point tonight and can just hide in the bushes all day tomorrow.<br><br>Just like for third class, Sally and I agreed to take the second class exam at the same time. She is at another park trying to get from point A to point B, just like I am. Two naked women are running around in the woods in the dark. What a sight we must be!<br><br>After half a mile, I come to my first fork in the trail: left turn for Pinewood Trail and right turn for Cherry Tree Trail. I turn left and keep walking. So far so good. I know where I am. Another half mile later, I stop to take a rest at the next fork. In a clearing near the fork, I see and bright orange object in contrast with all the green foliage. Curiously, I step in that direction to see what it is and discover that the orange color is in fact an orange and part of a pile of fruit: apples, bananas, tangerines, grapes, and even strawberries, my favorite! What is a pile of fruit doing out here?! Clean and fresh, the fruit does not look like it has been here that long. Remembering that Sally was able to get a candy bar when she took her third class exam, I thought that this is a story I would be able to tell the gang back home: "I found a whole pile of fresh fruit! So there!"<br><br>I step a little closer and get within a foot of the fruit, when all of a sudden, I feel a rope tighten itself around my left ankle and pull it out from under me. I drop to the ground, get dragged, then hoisted up five feet in the air. The whole thing happens in three seconds. I am now swinging upside down by my left ankle. Hanging upside down is no fun. The last time I was completely upside down was during the promotion to third class slave when Master installed my pussy shield. In a way, this is actually more awkward. During the ceremony, both of my ankles were strapped and raised together, so I was symmetrical, and my weight was distributed evenly between both ankles. This time I only have one ankle attached. My right leg is free and trying to lower itself like my arms. The pain around my left ankle is horrendous, because it is bearing all my weight. After a while I stop swinging like a pendulum. I try reaching up to untie the rope but don't even get close. My hands get as far as my thighs. I cannot reach any farther. I am stuck. This was obviously a trap for some animal, who would see or smell the fruit, then get close enough to become a prisoner of the trap. In this case, I am the animal that got caught.<br><br>The park is pitch-black now. I don't know how long I have been hanging here. Even if I could get down now, I would have to stay here until dawn when I can see again to proceed. The way things look now, I will hang like this until someone comes to release me, most likely a hiker or jogger in the morning. By then, I will be very hard pressed to make it to the pick-up point. My head feels like it is ready to explode. My right hamstring aches because my right leg is bending forward from gravity. My legs are trying to do the splits vertically, which they cannot do, so it hurts. It is also getting cold. I can't move around very much, so I also begin to get goose bumps and shiver a little. This really sucks.<br><br>I hear footsteps approaching. It sounds like two men, but I cannot be sure. As they approach, I can see two flashlights. They come straight at me and shine their beams up on me.<br><br>"Look, Ken. We captured a live one!"<br><br>"Whoooweee! We sure did, and she looks like a mean one, too."<br><br>Who are these guys, and why are they making fun of me?<br><br>"This is the best one we've caught yet."<br><br>"Yep. Can't wait to take her back and get the place cleaned up."<br><br>They proceed to get me down and don't hesitate to "accidentally" brush my private parts with their hands while doing it. When I am finally down on the ground, I get up and try to run away. But as soon as I put weight on my left foot, my ankle screams in agony. I quickly drop to the ground holding my ankle. The men walk over to me. One of them picks me up and throws me over his shoulder like a side of beef. They walk down the trail all the way back to the parking area I started in. They open the camper shell on the back of their beat up old pick up truck, and throw me in. They close it, lock it, and get into the cab section. We start driving away from the park but not towards the city where my home is. Instead, we drive in the opposite direction, deeper into the woods. It is so dark that I have no idea where I am going.<br><br>After about an hour, we stop at a log cabin in the woods, their cabin. They open the camper shell and order me out. I hobble in to the cabin with them. The place is a pig sty. Empty beer bottles are everywhere. The mismatched furniture is the kind you would see in a college student's apartment but even older. A huge hole is in the middle of the sofa. The place is dusty, moldy, smelly, and untidy. So many dirty dishes are piled on the kitchen counter that I cannot even see the counter. Is that a dead cockroach? Gross.<br><br>Ken wraps a chain around my left ankle and locks it with a padlock. He takes the other end of the chain and goes into the kitchen. I have no choice but to follow him in. He wraps the other end around a handle on the wood-burning oven and locks it with a padlock. The chain is 12 feet long. The oven is bolted to the floor. I am not going anywhere except within a 12-foot radius of the oven.<br><br>"Hey little lady, we want ya to cook and clean fer us. You do that, won't you?" Ken says to me.<br><br>"No way, why should I?" I reply in defiance.<br><br>"because if ya don't, we never feed ya. Ha!"<br><br>A cell phone rings. Ken reaches into his pocket and pulls it out.<br><br>"Hallo. Yea we got ‘er. Oh she's a feisty one. Don't worry. She's not goin' nowhere."<br><br>Ken hangs up then leaves me in the kitchen.<br><br>Who is he talking to? Who else knows I am here. It sounds as if this whole thing was planned.<br><br>They hang out for a couple of hours drinking beer in the main room. I learn that the one guy is named Ken and his partner in crime is Jose. After a while they both fall asleep drunk. I am sitting in the middle of the kitchen nursing my ankle the best I can and crying. How did I get myself into this mess? If only I did not try to touch that fruit. I should have just kept walking, then I would still be in the park.<br><br>The next morning, Ken scolds me for not cleaning the kitchen, then tells me to have it clean and dinner ready when they get back. They both hop into their pick up truck and leave. I now have a chance to escape, but how? I am chained up like an animal. My ankle is sprained. I am naked. And I don't even know where I am. Fearing what they would do to me if I don't do as they say, I start cleaning. The dishes are gross, but there is a bottle of dish soap on the sink. The dishes alone take three hours to wash, rinse, dry and put away. I then clean out the oven, which is not too bad. I take a broom and wipe away all the cobwebs, then sweep the floor, swatting a cockroach in the process. I open the refrigerator to see what I can eat and make them for dinner. The only thing in the fridge is beer, lots of it and nothing else. How do they expect me to make dinner with beer? I close the fridge, then curl up into a corner of the kitchen.<br><br>It is getting dark again and about the time Katherine would be at the pick-up point. She is probably looking for me right now and wondering where I am. I hear Ken and Jose drive back and enter the cabin.<br><br>"Well lookie here. She cleaned for us, Jose." Ken says.<br><br>"Whoa! So that is what the kitchen counter looks like." Jose says.<br><br>Ken and Jose bring in grocery bags filled with food. They hand them to me and tell me to make dinner. It's not hard. Most of what they bought was pre-made and canned. I just opened up the packaging, placed it on a plate and handed it to them. They seem okay with it. After they are almost done eating, Ken gets up, reaches into the bag, and plops a pint of strawberries on the floor next to me.<br><br>"These are fer you." Ken says.<br><br>I don't have much of an appetite at this point and remain curled up in the kitchen. Later in the evening, Ken and Jose get drunk on beer again. Ken passes out much closer to me than last night. So close in fact that I might be able to reach into his pocket and grab the cell phone. When I hear both of them snoring, I move very slowly towards Ken. I carefully reach into his pocket and pull the phone out. I slowly crawl back into the kitchen with it and start dialing Master's phone number.<br><br>"Hello." Katherine answers.<br><br>"Katherine! It's me, Marissa." I say to her in a whispered but desperate tone.<br><br>"Marissa! Where in the world are you?"<br><br>"I don't know." I speak quickly and softly.<br><br>"I went to the pick up point, but you weren't there."<br><br>"I know. I am being held prisoner by two goons. Please help me."<br><br>"Prisoner, did you say?"<br><br>"Yes, two men kidnapped me in the park last night. They won't let me go."<br><br>"Marissa, stay on this line, I am going to have it traced."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>I keep the receiver to my ear and mouth but hear nothing but static. After 15 minutes, I begin to wonder if I got disconnected. Both men are still fast asleep. I can still hear them snoring in the next room.<br><br>"Marissa? Are you still there?"<br><br>"Yes, I am still here."<br><br>"Marissa, we think we know where you are. Stay there. We are coming to get you."<br><br>"Okay, please hurry."<br><br>"Okay. Bye."<br><br>Katherine hangs up, but my hopes rise. They are on their way. I hope they get here soon. I wonder what I should do with this cell phone. Should I keep it in case Katherine calls, or try to sneak it back into Ken's pocket? If she calls, the ringing would wake them up anyway. So, I decide to quietly inch my way towards Ken to return his cell phone. I successfully get it back into his pocket, then return to my place in the kitchen.<br><br>After a couple of hours, I hear a car coming towards the cabin. Ken and Jose wake up. We all look out the window. Master, Katherine and Jackie are getting out of the minivan. Master is wearing a light blue dress shirt and dark pants. Katherine is projecting a white polo shirt and blue jeans. Jackie is projecting her jujitsu uniform. Ken and Jose are too hung over to move very fast. Master knocks on the door and tells us to open up. Ken searches for his shotgun while Jose trips and falls over a six pack of beer.<br><br>I yell out, "Master! I'm here. I'm here. Help me!"<br><br>Jackie busts open the door. Ken tries to take a smack at her, but she grabs his arm and throws him over her shoulder towards the window. Ken breaks through the window and lands outside. Jose tries to get up, but before he can stand erect, Jackie kicks her knee into his face causing him to fall to the floor face down. She then digs her knee into his back, grabs his right arm and pulls it behind him into a hammer lock. The whole fight lasts about ten seconds.<br><br>I run towards Master and Katherine, who enter the cabin once the fighting is over. Since my ankle is still attached to the chain, I yank the chain and fall down. Master comes to me, helps me up, and I give him a big hug. Just then a sheriff's car drives up with a deputy sheriff. After embracing the Master for 60 seconds, I give Katherine a hug. The sheriff places Ken and Jose under arrest. The key is found to release my ankle. Katherine hands me my battery, so I get my maid uniform running. I don't know why but begin to cry. I am so happy and relieved to be safe at last.<br><br>Back at the mansion, Dr. Otis checks my ankle and decides that it is only a strain and should be fine in a couple of weeks. Master decides that I cannot promote to second class slave, because I called for help. It does not matter that I was caught in a trap or kidnapped. Rules are rules. However, he says that I can retake the test in a few weeks when my ankle is better. For compensation of my bravery, he gives me an extra battery. I thank the Master for the battery, Katherine for tracing my call, and especially Jackie for rescuing me. I now appreciate Jackie so much more now that I have seen her martial arts skills put to practical use. The Master has a terrific body guard. From now on, I am going to work out much harder and get in better shape. I might even choose jujitsu as one of my specialties. Sally successfully passed her second class nudity exam without incident and will be going through promotion ceremony. They waited for me to come home before commencement.<br><br>In the dungeon, all the slaves are standing in a circle appearing naked with Sally standing in the center. A USB cable is running from her pussy shield to the Master's PDA. When he is done, he disconnects the cable and turns on everyone's pussy shield to display maid outfits. With her brand new, blue-colored, second class uniform projecting, Sally stands on the pedestal and bends forward. Maria, Bethany and I kiss her buttocks as a token of our subservience to her. I have mixed feelings at this point. I should be getting promoted alongside Sally but through bad luck, I am still a third class slave. Sally is now a higher rank than me. I should not have to kiss her rear; I should be standing next to her getting my buttocks kissed, too. After Sally kisses the feet of her superiors, Master presents her with bedding: fitted sheet, flat sheet, wool blanket, pillow and pillowcase. Second class slaves can sleep with bed sheets.<br><br>As we are getting ready for bed in the basement, Sally and I sit naked on our bunk beds and talk.<br><br>"slave Marissa, I am so sorry you went through that ordeal."<br><br>"Yes, Mistress Sally, but I am sure glad those guys are behind bars."<br><br>"You know. It's a funny thing. When I was running through the woods for my second class exam, I saw a pile chocolate bars off the side of the trail."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"Yes, really. I thought it was very strange. But, I did not pick any of them up and just kept going.<br><br>Sally pauses then changes the subject. "When will you have another chance to take the second class exam?<br><br>"Master said as soon as my ankle is healed, maybe a few weeks."<br><br>"Well, that's not long. Then we'll be the same rank again."<br><br>Sally notices that I am eyeing her bedding. She knows that I am wishing I had my own.<br><br>"slave Marissa, come sleep with me tonight."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"You can share my sheets with me, just for tonight."<br><br>"Oh, I don't know."<br><br>Sally gets into bed and raises a corner of her blanket up in a motion for me to join her.<br><br>"Come on." She encourages me.<br><br>I get into bed with her. The soft cotton sheets and her body are so toasty warm. It feels so good to feel cotton on my body again.<br><br>"Mistress Sally"<br><br>"Yes, slave Marissa."<br><br>"I have a personal question for you."<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Are you a lesbian?"<br><br>Sally smiles and shakes her head. "No, I like men. I love Master."<br><br>I smile back. Then we roll over and go to sleep. I have a dream.<br><br>I am stark naked hanging upside down by my ankles in leather straps. My legs are together. Other slaves are also naked and hanging in the same inverted suspension. No one is wearing her pussy shield or chastity belt. Our heads are hanging about four or five feet from the floor. We are all in a great circle facing one another. At first glance it appears we are all holding hands in the circle. But upon closer inspection, our outstretched arms are held that way with handcuffs. My left wrist is in one cuff while the slaves' right wrist next to me is in the other cuff. This pattern repeats around the circle. No one else is in the dungeon, no tormentor. But, we are all happy, smiling, laughing, socializing, and unified. We could stay like this forever.<br><br><i>Current rank: Third Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 5<br>No. of virtual outfits: 2</i>`

"Mistress, what’s wrong?"<br><br>"You are not supposed to be sleeping with sheets. Bed sheets are only reserved for second class and up." Katherine explains.<br><br>Sally and I get out of her bed. Katherine, appearing very authoritative in her head maid uniform, orders us to follow her immediately. We don’t take a shower or use the toilet, or turn our pussy shields on, or eat breakfast or do any of our other morning activities.  We simply walk naked with her all the way out to the fifth hole of the golf course.<br><br>"Stay here." she commands and walks back to the mansion.<br><br>Sally and I are feeling a little guilty for violating another rule.

As we stand shivering with the morning dew at out feet, we wonder what Katherine and the Master have in store for us as discipline. It is unusual for us to be out here like this. Almost all discipline I have ever seen or gone through took place in the dungeon. My bladder is very full, so I decide to urinate on the grass. Sally watches me and does the same.<br><br>An hour and a half later, The Master, Katherine, and all the slaves walk to us with the Master carrying a bag. They stop in front of us, and Master empties the contents of the bag: assorted chains and padlocks.<br><br>The Master speaks, "Slave Marissa, you have been found wearing bed sheets, which is an infraction of the rules. Slave Sally, you aided and abetted another slave to violate a rule, which is also an infraction. Therefore the two of you shall be disciplined. Since the two of you like to rely on each other’s body warmth so much, we shall enable you to continue enjoying it as part of your discipline. Slave Sara, slave Jackie, please proceed."<br><br>Sara and Jackie move us so that I am facing right up against Sally. Our toes, knees, pussy shields, stomachs, and breasts are touching one another. My nose is one inch away from Sally’s. Sara and Jackie begin wrapping chains around our ankles, working their way up our legs and waists. Sara tells us to wrap our arms around each other so we are hugging. Jackie promptly handcuffs our hands behind each others’ backs, then runs additional chains through them and attaches them to our waist chains with padlocks. Finally, our upper torsos are wrapped in chains, around our shoulders and under our arms, and lock in place with more padlocks. Sally and I can’t help but continue embracing each other. Our four ankles are locked together so we can’t walk.<br><br>The Master continues speaking, "Slaves Marissa and Sally, the keys to the locks shall be sitting on a patio table by the pool. You can free yourselves when you can reach them. I hope that your discipline today teaches you that you must follow the rules given to you in the <i>Slave's Rulebook</i>. This concludes the discipline. Dismissed.<br><br>On that note everyone returns to the mansion and resumes their duties for the day, except the two of us. Sally and I just look at each other and down at our chains. The fifth hole is the furthest hole from the swimming pool. We have several hundred yards to travel before reaching the keys. Walking would have been a cinch, but we are not given that luxury.<br><br>Sally asks, "What do we do now?"<br><br>"We try to make it back to the pool where the keys are." I answer.<br><br>"And how do you propose we do that?"<br><br>We think a moment then I suggest, "Can we try jumping?"<br><br>"You mean hop our way to the pool?"<br><br>"Yea."<br><br>"Okay let’s try. Ready 1-2-3."<br><br>We both jump but don’t quite jump and the same time and quickly fall on the grass. We land on our sides, and Sally’s arm takes the brunt of the fall.<br><br>"Ouch! That hurts." Sally complains.<br><br>It is impossible for us to get back up. We soon find that rolling over each other is the quickest way to travel. When we reach the fourth hole, we take a break from rolling. Sally is on the grass facing up; I am on top of her facing down. My nose is still an inch away from hers. We look into each others’ eyes. I am not sure if it is gravity pulling on my strained neck or my estrogen level, but I slowly lower my lips onto Sally’s. She puckers up. With both our eyes closed, we kiss for several seconds. I raise my head back up and open my eyes. Sally slowly opens her eyes. We just stare at each other with blank faces and say nothing for a half a minute.<br><br>Sally breaks the moment by softly saying to me. "We better keep going."<br><br>I come out of my drunken lust state and agree with her, "Yea, you’re right. Let’s keep going."<br><br>We resume our rolling on the golf course: past the third hole, in and out of a bunker, and to the second hole. We stop our progress when we see two men and a woman walking towards us with golf bags. One of them is the Master; the other a man I had never seen. A naked-looking Maria is serving as their caddy. The men look like they are playing golf and are about 30 feet away having a casual conversation. Master ignores us. The other man keeps glancing our way and no doubt is curious about what two naked women are doing chained up to each other on a golf course. He does not ask Master who we are or what we are doing. They continue playing and move on.<br><br>After a few hours, we finally get off the grass and roll onto the hard pool deck. The deck has a half dozen patio tables, but Master did not say which one the keys would be on. The patio tables have metal legs painted white. The tables are round and made of frosted glass. We roll to the closest table and look up through the glass.<br><br>"Do you see anything?" Sally asks.<br><br>"No, not this one." I reply.<br><br>And we move on to the next table. We painstakingly make our way to all six tables but find no keys. Not knowing what to do next, we just lay there. Soon, Sara comes out and asks us, "Looking for these?" Twirling around her index finger are the keys that we so desperately need. Sally and I say nothing and both frown as we face our tormentor.<br><br>"I am tempted to throw these in the pool, but if Master found I did that I would get in trouble. So, I think I’ll just put the keys back where I found them."<br><br>Sara walks to the patio table that is farthest away from us, places the keys on it, then walks away. Sally and I roll our way to that table. Just as we reach it, Sara comes back out to the table. "Oh I am sorry. I put the keys back on the wrong table. He left them over here. My mistake."<br><br>Sara grabs the keys and puts them on another table a few yards away. Just as she is doing that, Katherine cames out.  "Slave Sara, what are you doing?" Katherine inquires.<br><br>"Oh I was just going to hand the keys to Sally and Marissa. They look like they need some help."<br><br>"It’s not your place to be helping a slave while they are being disciplined." Katherine forcefully says. "Don’t you have to be sorting books in the library or something?"<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>"Well, then get to it."<br><br>"Yes Mistress."<br><br>Sara walks back into the house. Katherine comes towards us, grabs the keys, and unlocks us. I can finally bend my joints again after being locked up with Sally for almost six hours.<br><br>"Are you two all right?"<br><br>Sally and I answer in the affirmative.<br><br>"Go get cleaned up and get something to eat. Your discipline is over. I think you learned your lessons." She says kindly.<br><br>"Yes Mistress." We answer in unison.<br><br>It is Saturday, and Master is taking all third class slaves and above to the beach. He is also giving us all two gifts. The first are 100% waterproof, sandproof, dustproof, saltproof, hermetically-sealed pussy shield covers, his newest invention. Made of a clear plastic, wearing them over our pussy shields allows us to swim in the ocean, play in the sand, and enjoy the ocean air. They are a little uncomfortable but manageable for short-term use. I definitely would be wearing mine to the beach but not for everyday wear. The second are virtual swimsuits. Each slave gets a different one. Katherine gets a triangle tank one-piece, with white floral design on a black background. Jackie gets a one-piece, portrait back top, which ties at the back of the neck, solid green. Sara gets a one-piece, V-neck halter, pink with white polka dots. Linda gets a one-piece, bandeau tank, with a back closure, solid navy blue. Maria gets a two-piece, consisting of a bandeau top, similar to Linda’s but dark pink, and a matching bikini bottom. Sally gets a one-piece, side-tie tunic, aqua color with a teal floral design. I get a two-piece, made up of a bikini top and matching swim mini, green with white polka dots. The swimsuits are so convincing, it even looks like Katherine has two full breasts. Master is so impressed with his work that he decides that we will project them in the cars all the way to the beach.<br><br>Everyone is excited about the beach trip, except for Bethany. She has been getting lazy in her chores, so Master chains her to the toilet in the basement for the entire duration of the trip. She will clean the entire bathroom with a toothbrush and will be released when we return. She would not have been able to go anyway, because she is still an apprentice slave.<br><br>We take two cars: the minivan and the four-door coupe. The Master, Sara, Sally and I ride in the minivan. Katherine, Jackie, Linda, and Maria take the coupe. The beach is on a coastal town, and suburban homes are very near the beach. The closest residents only have to walk across the street, then down two flights of stairs to reach the sand. When we arrive at the beach, parking is scarce. The beach has no parking lot, so we have to park on the street. The minivan reaches the beach first and finds a parking spot about one block away. We get out and unpack our gear, just the typical beach blankets (yes, Master allowed them this time), beach umbrellas, folding chairs, coolers, picnic baskets, and lots of sunscreen. We carry our gear to the beach from the minivan. When we reach the beach, a sign says, "NUDE BEACH." The Master swears that he didn’t know it was a nude beach, but no one seems to mind, so we head down. Passengers from the coupe join us about fifteen minutes later on the beach. Master pulls out his remote control and turns off everyone’s pussy shields. The swimsuits stop projecting and disappear, and we now blend in with all the other nudists on the beach, including the Master, who takes it all off.<br><br>We all have a wonderful time swimming, building sand castles, eating Linda’s water chestnut sandwiches, macaroni salad, fried chicken, and watermelon. The sun is shining. People are in a good mood. Sally blows up a beach ball, and we hit that around for a while. Sara sets up a badminton set, and some of the slaves play with that.  Occasionally, some gawkers are using binoculars are at the top of the cliff, but we ignore them.<br><br>Sally and I also take some time to comb the beach on our own and talk.<br><br>"Mistress Sally, I would like to talk about what happened at the golf course a few weeks ago."<br><br>"What about?" She asks.<br><br>"Well, we sort of kissed briefly. Do you remember?"<br><br>"Yes, I remember. But as far as I am concerned it didn’t happen."<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"I am not a lesbian, and I love Master. I am not sure why I kissed you and would rather not do that again."<br><br>"Oh, I see."<br><br>Sally takes my hand and kindly explains, "Slave Marissa, you’re my best friend, and I want to keep it that way. I don’t want anything to come between my and Master. You understand?"<br><br>"Yes, I do. That’s probably best. Our Master should come first, and I love him, too." I reply.<br><br>As the sun begins to set, everyone on the beach starts packing. Soon, we are the only ones left. Master take out his remote control and turns everyone’s swimsuit back on--except mine. Feeling a little self-conscious, I ask Master a question, "Master, can you turn on my swimsuit, too, please?"<br><br>"No, slave Marissa, I shall not. You are heading back as you are."<br><br>He continues folding his beach umbrella and tying it up. I pause for a moment in my confusion, and then ask, "Master, I am afraid I don’t understand."<br><br>"I did not want to say anything until it was time, but I suppose that time is now. Slave Marissa, you are taking the second class final exam tonight."<br><br>"What?!" I gasp.<br><br>"As promised, as soon as your ankle healed, I would allow you to take the exam. I have been watching you run around on the beach all day. It looks healed to me."<br><br>"Yes, but I was not expecting this."<br><br>"All the more reason to take the exam now. You never know when you might be naked. It could be anywhere anytime. Knowing how to stay dignified when suddenly and unexpectedly naked is much better than being embarrassed. Don’t you think?"<br><br>I look around at all the other slaves who are busy packing. Either they already knew about the exam and kept it a secret, or disn’t seem to care about learning about my predicament right now.<br><br>"I guess. So, is this the drop-off point? And where is the pick-up point?"<br><br>"Well, this is obviously the drop-off point, but the pick-up point is going to be a little different than a typical second class exam. You see, you need to find the pick-up point in the form of a four-door coupe."<br><br>"Huh?" My confusion level is rising.<br><br>Master speaks to Katherine, "Slave Katherine, the keys, please."<br><br>Katherine walks over to us and hands Master the keys to the coupe, who then hands them to me. "Somewhere parked within five square blocks from here is the coupe. Find it and drive it home. When you reach the mansion, you pass the exam."<br><br>It becomes clear to me now what Master’s intentions are. "Master, how is everyone who came here in the coupe getting home?"<br><br>"We are all piling in the minivan," Katherine answers. "It has an additional row of seats in the back."<br><br>It sounds to me like they had this all planned from the beginning.<br><br>Master continues, "We did not want this to be a repeat of your previous second class exam. This is a make-up exam, which means that it is slightly different, but the difficulty level is about the same. It is also potentially shorter. Unlike a traditional second class exam, which takes 24 hours, this one only takes as long as it takes to find the vehicle and drive home. You might say it is in-between a first class and second class exam, because there is no pick-up from us, yet we are providing you a means to get home. Who knows? With any luck, you might find the car in fifteen minutes and be home in an hour."<br><br>My heart starts to pump harder. I am getting very nervous knowing I am going to be left nude here. All the other slaves except Sara wish me luck. Sally gives me a hug. I watch everyone climb the stairs and disappear up and over the cliff. I am standing on a completely deserted beach with absolutely nothing but keys in my right hand, wearing my pussy shield, and plastic shield cover. Dusk has arrived.<br><br>I turn around to sit facing the ocean and decide to wait until it is dark enough to make the attempt. For my earlier second class exam, I was out in the woods with no one around, well, except for those two goons. Now I have to run naked through the city streets. People are in their homes; cars are driving by. Ugh! I’ll be seen for sure. I bring my knees closer to my chest, wrap my arms around my legs, and bury my head in my lap. I reminisce about my time spent with the Master: the first time he saw me, the meals, the discipline, and the dance lessons. Ah, the dance lessons. I love dancing with him. He smiles and is very patient with me as I learn. I don’t wear dance shoes (or any shoes for that matter) when we dance, so when he steps on my feet, his ears know it. I wonder if I will ever get dancing shoes--real ones. Soon I fall asleep and have a dream.<br><br><i>It’s a sunny day, and I am standing naked on the beach. A couple of other people are around, but I do not know them, and they don’t know me. I feel myself sinking into the sand: first my ankles, then my knees, legs, pelvis, tummy, and chest. I struggle to get out but cannot. My shoulders, head, and arms are immersed into the sand. At first I cannot see anything but open my eyes and can see the sand. The sand does not enter my eyes, and I can still breathe. At first I am stuck and cannot move at all. But later, I use my arms and legs to begin "swimming" through the sand. I am able to move easily through it. The sand feels very soft, like cotton, and fluid, like water. I come to believe I am a sand mermaid, enjoying my time inside the beach.<br><br>Someone else is in the sand with me. It’s Master! He is swimming in the sand naked, too. We hold hands and swim together. Even though we are buried in sand, we can still see each other and see where we are going. The sand is so warm, fluffy, and smooth. It’s a wonderful feeling. Master and I hug, then kiss as we spin in buried sand.</i><br><br>I wake up, and the beach is dark. The sun has set. When I feel it is dark enough and late enough, I slowly walk up the stairs and stop to just peek over the street. Street lights are everywhere, but no one is out and about. No cars are coming, so I climb the last few stairs and onto street level. Anyone driving by or looking out the window from their beachfront home will see me. I quickly cross the street and head down the nearest street running perpendicular from the beach. Keeping a sharp eye out for the coupe, I run quickly under street lights and slow down in-between them where the street is not as well lit. I reach the end of the block and randomly decide to turn right and go down another street. I see lights on through the windows of some homes and can hear television sets running in their living rooms. Perhaps I started this too early. Too many people are still up. I have no way to know what time it is but guess that it is not yet bedtime.<br><br>Suddenly a car rounds the corner and heads my way. Before the headlights can catch me, I duck between two parallel-parked cars on the street. The car goes by. Whew! I get up and keep walking but still see no sign of the coupe. Oh where can it be? I might spend the whole night looking for it. I turn another corner and walk down another street, getting farther away from the beach. Two more cars drive by. I react accordingly by ducking behind cars or bushes, whatever is closest and easiest. If a car happens to stop right where I am hiding, I am screwed.<br><br>Without warning, a man walks out the front door of a house, stops at the driver’s side door of his car and sees me. We both freeze. I am about three houses away. Remembering what my Master said about dignity, I casually walk behind a tall fence in the front yard of a neighboring house in the hopes that he will get in his car and drive away. I hear nothing for a few minutes. I assume he is either still waiting for me or he went back into the house. Then I hear a car door opening and closing from his direction, but no sound of a car engine starting. Another few minutes later I decide that I can’t wait any longer. Someone knows I am here and might try to find me. I have to get away. Peeking out, I don’t see him, so I step back onto the sidewalk and keep going. As I pass his parked car, I see him inside leaning towards me with a surprised look on his face. I keep stride and start running away. He just sits there and looks at me. My heart slows down when I turn another corner away from his field of vision.<br><br>In addition to looking out for people at their house windows, cars driving by me, and people on the sidewalk, I also now look through parked car windows to make sure no one was sitting in their car while I walk by. Additionally, I still need to find that darn coupe. Sometimes I walk by a house with a motion sensor porch light. I can’t always tell at first if it is me walking by causing it to turn on, or someone in the house flipping a switch. I learn to hate them and gasp every time a light turns on near me.<br><br>After what seems like hours and several more blocks, I finally find the coupe. I put the key in the lock, turn it, open the door, and get in. Yes, I found the right one. I look around and quickly put the key in the ignition, and start the motor. I am driving home.<br><br>Yes!<br><br>Eventually I have to leave the quiet residential streets and drive on a multiple lane, well-lit street with several stoplights. I stop at the first light. Before long, a car, with two guys in it stops at the light next to me on my left. It doesn’t take long for the guy in the passenger seat to notice that I am topless. He probably can’t tell I am totally naked.<br><br>He tells his driver to look in my direction. Now they are both staring and gawking at me. The red lights always seem to take longer when you are in a hurry, like I am right then. Hurry up and turn green! The light finally turns green, and I hit the gas pedal hard, speeding up faster than they. Unfortunately, the next light also turns red, and I have to stop again. The car on my left pulls up next to me again with those two guys laughing at me and having a great time at my expense. My body might be chilled from running around in the ocean night air, but my face is feeling really warm. Once again the light turns green, and I put a lead foot onto the gas pedal, determined to make the next light. I reach the intersection just as it turns yellow and go through. By the time those two guys reach it, the light is red, but they try to run it. Crash! Another car that has the green light smashes into the driver side, a T-bone collision.<br><br>I breathe a little easier when I hit the freeway, because it doesn’t have many cars. It must be getting late. I finally make it back to the estate. Unlike my previous exams, no one is there to greet me when I pull into the driveway. I park the car in the garage, and then go through the house looking for someone anyone to tell that I am home and that I passed the exam. The lights sre off, and all is quiet. The kitchen clock reads 12:35 a.m. Through an ajar door, I see a light on in Katherine’s office and enter.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, there you are!"<br><br>Katherine and Master are inside talking. Katherine gets up from behind her desk and gives me a hug. Master also gives me a hug.<br><br>"Hi Master, Mistress. I made it."<br><br>"Welcome home. Did it go okay? Any problems?" She asks.<br><br>"Well, a few people saw me, and I did cause an auto accident."<br><br>"An auto accident? Are you all right?" Master asks with concern.<br><br>"Oh yes, I am fine. I was not in the accident. Two guys who were too busy watching me and not the stoplight caused the accident."<br><br>"Well, you’ll have to tell us all about it in the morning." Master says.<br><br>"Does this mean I made second class?"<br><br>"Yes, we’ll have the ceremony tomorrow, and congratulations." Master replies.<br><br>"Thank you, Master, and thank you, Mistress."<br><br>The next evening, I officially get promoted to second class slave via the slave promotion ceremony. I also receive my virtual blue-colored, second class maid uniform, my bed sheets, and kisses on my buttocks from Maria and Bethany. When I first got here, Maria outranked me and called me slave; now I outrank her. She will be calling me Mistress.<br><br><i>Current rank: Second Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 5<br>No. of virtual outfits: 3</i>`

                    content: `During the next year, Master takes on two more recruit slaves: Leslie and Laurie. Leslie comes first. She is petite like me but has curly brown hair and green eyes. Laurie comes to the mansion a few months later after Leslie got promoted to apprentice slave. Laurie is also small, and her hair is dark brown and shoulder length. Does Master have a thing for petite women? Hmm.<br><br>One day, Master calls Sara into his office along with Katherine. They are in a there a very long time, almost two hours. Suddenly, the door quickly swings open and Sara sprints out like a mad woman. The expression on her face looks like the world is coming to an end. Projecting her maid uniform, she passes the entryway, out the front door, through the front gate, and just keeps on running down the street. All the slaves wonder what’s going on with Sara.<br><br>At dinner that evening, Master explains, "Slave Sara is no longer part of this estate. I doubt we will ever see her again."<br><br>"What? What? What?" We all say to one another.<br><br>Master continues, "Sara has severely violated several rules of the slave’s rulebook and her contract. She has been under suspicion for some time now, and only recently were we able to prove that she committed those infractions."<br><br>"What infractions?" Linda asks.<br><br>"Well, when she took her first class nudity exam, she called someone ahead of time to secretly and discreetly follow us from the mansion to her drop-off point. After we stranded Sara at the park and drove away, her brother rode up in a pick-up truck, picked her up, and gave her some real clothes. They then went out to dinner and had a few drinks. Then he drove her to about a block or so away from the estate. She gave back the clothes and walked in naked, making it look like she got back all by herself."<br><br>"But isn’t asking for help okay?" I ask.<br><br>"No, it isn’t. The rulebook says that you can ask someone for help AFTER you get dropped off, not before." The Master explains. "And that’s not all. Slave Marissa, when you and slave Sally both took your nudity exams for second class at the same time, those piles of food you saw were a plant."<br><br>"A plant?" Sally asks.<br><br>"Yes, a plant. Ken and Jose knew ahead of time that you would both be out there. They knew what your favorite foods are, and set up the traps accordingly."<br><br>"They knew?! How could they have possibly known?!" Sally and I ask. Now we are leaning on the edge of our seats holding our breaths.<br><br>"Ken is Sara’s brother!" Master says.<br><br>"WHAAAAAT!!!" We all shout.<br><br>"Ken and Sara are brother and sister."<br><br>Linda’s eyes roll. Jackie spits out her food. I choke on mine. Sally’s hands cover her face.<br><br>Master continues, "Sara snuck into Katherine’s office and found out ahead of time where we were going to drop-off Marissa and Sally. She gave that information to Ken and his friend, Jose. Ken was also the one who helped Sara during her first class exam."<br><br>Katherine speaks, "Master, tell them how you found out."<br><br>Master responds, "I hired a private investigator to investigate Ken and Jose. My lawyer and I interrogated them in jail and struck a plea bargain with Ken. He confessed to everything for a lighter sentence."<br><br>With the truth about Sara out, every slave around the table starts talking about how Sara treated her, the glue, the singing, the hazing, the abuse, everything.<br><br>"Yes, we were suspicious of all that hazing too, but had no way to prove it. Today, slave Katherine and I sat down with Sara to discuss the whole matter, and we discussed discipline for her, everything from demotion to excommunication. She got so upset; she ran out and ran away."<br><br>"Master, why would she do such a thing? Why was she so mean to us?" Linda asks.<br><br>"Sara had aspirations to become head slave. She saw the rest of you as competition and threats to that end. Sara has separated herself from us."<br><br>It later occurs to me that the person Ken was talking to on his cell phone must have been Sara. And, all those candy bars that Sally saw during her second class nudity exam were planted there for Sally as a trap. If she had tried to grab one, she would have ended up in the cabin with me. It also made sense that Sara made it back so soon from her first class nudity exam. She had help.<br><br>After dinner, everyone gets up and breathes a sigh of relief. Sara is gone for good.<br><br>From the <i>Slave's Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>Second Class Slave </i></em></strong><br><br>As a second class slave, you have continued to expand your household duties and receive additional virtual clothing. During the promotion ceremony to second class slave, your third class maid uniform (red) was deleted and replaced with your second class maid uniform (blue). Second class slaves along with First class slaves now have the privilege of eating all meals in the main dining room with the Master and Head Slave. Second class slaves sleep on the same mattresses and in the same basement as third class slaves but with sheets, blanket, and pillow. This bedding can only be used when you sleep in the basement. Covering your body with them outside this purpose is considered an infraction.<br><br>First Class Slave Requirements<br><br><ol type="1"><li>Serve as a second class slave for at least two years.</li><li>Become an expert in one of the specialty areas chosen from third class and second class slave requirements.</li><li>Pass the same fitness test for recruit slave. (Must be taken two years or later from date of nudity final examination for second class slave)</li><li>Pass the nudity final examination for first class slave.</li><li>Complete the first class slave ceremony.</li></ol><br><br>"Marissa, you’re a natural dancer," Sally says with encouragement.<br><br>I have been dancing and practicing regularly with Master for two years now. We take one lesson a week and practice twice a week in-between lessons. Sometimes Sally comes to watch us practice. I enjoy dancing with Master, because it gives us additional one-on-one time.<br><br>"Marissa, you have no idea how good you are getting. You and Master look really good on the dance floor."<br><br>"Really, you think so?"<br><br>"Definitely. Other slaves have tried taking lessons and dancing with him, but it never worked out. You know, I think you should choose ballroom dancing as your specialty." Sally suggests.<br><br>"Oh no, I could never become an expert. I was thinking maybe cooking."<br><br>"No. No. No. Do ballroom dancing. Linda already dominates the kitchen. You need to find another niche, and I think ballroom dancing is it."<br><br>I talk it over with Master, and he totally agrees with Sally. So, Master increases our private lessons to three times per week with Johan, and we schedule practice times almost every day. Getting to be a really good dancer is grueling. I am very glad now that I stay in shape. Getting kidnapped by Ken and Jose turned out to be a hidden blessing. If it wasn’t for them, I would never have seen Jackie chop those guys up in the cabin during my rescue, and I would not appreciate how important it is to be in shape. Since then I get motivated to work out more and HAVE been working out more.<br><br>Master is an international style ten dancer. This means we dance both the five standard dances (waltz, foxtrot, tango, quickstep, and Viennese waltz) and the five Latin dances (cha cha, rumba, samba, jive, and paso doble). I had never worked so hard in all my life. Housekeeping work is cinchy compared to this.<br><br>One day Master tells me that he signed us up for a local dance contest. I express my reluctance, saying that I’m not good enough and need more time. Master would have none of it. He wants to expose me to the world of competition as an incentive to get better. He also says that I will get both a virtual ball gown for the standard competition as well as a virtual Latin outfit for the Latin dances. Wow! I’ll get to dress to the hilt, just like those couples on television.<br><br>Master loads my pussy shield with the two outfits. I look in the mirror and Whoa! The buttercup yellow, full-length ball gown is made of lycra and chiffon. It has green, blue, and clear rhinestones on the top and long mesh sleeves. The lycra top has three differing length layers with a V-neck shape. The chiffon bottom has yellow feathers around the hem. A separate necklace has blue and green rhinestones. White lycra is on the neckline and waistline. I even get virtual diamond earrings and virtual yellow, closed-toe dance shoes.<br><br>Unlike the ball gown which hides everything, the Latin dress shows almost everything and is designed to be sexy. It consists of a sleeveless, shoulder-less blue top with flower and leaf print stretch net made of lycra. The white bottom has a stretch satin skirt down to just above the knees. It comes with a matching choker, gloves, nylons, and beige, open-toe Latin dance shoes, all virtual of course.<br><br>Master pulls out all the stops for the night of our first dance contest. We take the limousine. All the third class slaves and above, the Master and I pile in. Master is even nice enough to give everyone nice virtual evening cocktail dresses for the event. Apparently dance contests do have dress codes. Master has on his black tail suit, complete with white shirt, white tie and tails, and patent leather shoes. He looks so dapper. On the way there, I keep hearing, "Knock ‘em dead, slave Marissa," and "Break a leg, Mistress Marissa."<br><br>When we arrive, the ballroom is packed with over 500 people. Many competitors are already warming up on the hardwood floor. The standard dances are first, so I am projecting my ball gown. The announcer asks all the dancers to take to the floor to begin. I hear waltz music playing, so Master and I take closed position and begin our waltz. In international standard dances, partners maintain closed position at all times. During our lessons at the mansion, Johan kept reinforcing that we should dance very close to each other for the standard dances. This is a group dance contest, which means that other couples are dancing on the floor at the same time. We get through the waltz, foxtrot, and then we are up to the tango. The tango is a rather jerky dance, and not really smooth like the other standard dances. When we finish dancing the tango I find that I can’t separate myself from Master. After each dance, the couples separate and bow to the audience, then resume closed position for the next dance. This time for some reason, the pussy shield gets stuck onto the zipper of his tail suit. All the other couples are taking their bows, but Master and I just stand there wondering what to do.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, if we force it, the pussy shield could malfunction leaving you naked." Master whispers to me.<br><br>The thought of being seen naked in front of 500 people terrifies me and churns my stomach. I am motivated to stay very close to Master.<br><br>The music starts again for the quickstep. The other couples start dancing, so we just start dancing with them. When the music stops, we are still stuck. People are starting to give us weird looks. When the last dance, the Viennese waltz, starts and ends, we decide we would just walk together sideways off the dance floor and out of the ballroom. Every eye in that ballroom is watching us as we do this. I feel so embarrassed. Master and I find a private corner out in the hallway, where Katherine and Sally catch up with us.<br><br>"What’s wrong?" Katherine asks.<br><br>"We’re stuck -- her pussy shield and my zipper," Master explains, "and we are afraid that if we pull away too hard, it will break not only my zipper but also her pussy shield."<br><br>"What can we do?" Katherine asks.<br><br>"Try reaching between my legs and feel around. Try unhooking us." Master suggests.<br><br>Katherine cringes at the thought but looks around and reaches under Master’s crotch and starts feeling around the zipper and pussy shield. People are walking by giving us strange looks, so Sally stands and blocks the view the best she can. After a couple of minutes, Katherine successfully unhooks us, and we separate. What a relief.<br><br>Master and I find a secluded spot to use his remote to change my virtual clothes to the Latin outfit. Then he runs off to the men’s changing room to change into his. I revel in the fact that changing clothes for me is instantaneous. People who wear real clothes, like the Master, have to go through the trouble of changing in a dressing room.<br><br>We dance the Latin portion of the contest without incident. When they announce the winners, we come in fifth place out of seven couples.<br><br>On the drive home, everyone congratulates the Master and me for a job well done. Jackie is very impressed with my hip motion during the Latin dances. She did not think I had it in me. I am just glad I got through it without having to be seen naked in front of all those people.<br><br>Over the next few months, we continue taking lessons and practicing and entering more dance competitions. We solve the zipper and pussy shield problem with a modification to Master’s tail suit. Before long, we are bringing home a few dance trophies: third place, second place, fourth place, third place again, and finally winning a first place trophy.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, have you ever seen theater arts style ballroom dancing?" Master asks me.<br><br>"Yes, I have seen them at the competitions. Those big men lift their partners and spin them around. It’s pretty impressive and quite elegant."<br><br>"I am interested in getting into that. I think you are small enough that I can lift you."<br><br>"Do you think so?"<br><br>"Yes, I do. Let’s talk to Johan about it."<br><br>Johan is more than happy to teach us theater arts style. It is actually a combination of ballet, modern dance, jazz, and ballroom and consists of a lot of lifts and drops. There is not much traveling like in the standard dances. It offers us an opportunity to choreograph our own lifts and drops.<br><br>Since Master will be lifting me off the ground much more, he decides that it was easier if he and Johan can see my naked body, so he can know where to hold me. So from now on, I attend all dance lessons and practice sessions without projecting clothing. Some of the lifts require that he grab my buttocks. I am actually sitting on his hand after he lifts me up over his head.<br><br>At our next competition, we sign up to compete in the theater arts event. Master had not had time to design my theater arts dress, so we are in the limo with a USB cable sticking in my pussy shield and the other end of it to his laptop.<br><br>"Master, we’re almost there. Hurry up." I urge.<br><br>"Okay. Okay. I am going as fast as I can." Master replies.<br><br>We finally pull up to the dance hall, and Master says, "Close enough," disconnects me, then shuts down the laptop. I get unusually nervous because this is my first theater arts competition, and we are going into it with a dress I had never seen or projected.<br><br>Inside the dance hall, he uses the remote to project the dress. It is quite simple, all chiffon, dark blue, sleeveless. It looks almost like a ballerina’s dress but with a regular flowing skirt and not tutus. Master did a pretty nice job given the amount of time he had to put it together.<br><br>Because the lifts and drops are so dangerous, all theater arts routines are done solo. When it is our turn, Master and I step out onto the floor and begin. The first few lifts and drops are only at Master’s waist level, then he lifts me over his head. I am face up and my back is arched causing my head to drop back, so I am looking upside down. I hear the crowd roar and cheer and applaud. They seem to really be impressed with this lift and our dancing. Master lowers me back down. The crowd is still cheering for us. No other theater arts couple before us got this enthusiastic a response. My emotions are beaming at this point. I had no idea we are this good.<br><br>When we finish our routine, we get a standing ovation, which no one else received that night. We step off the floor, and people are still looking at us. A narrow thin mirror between two columns serves as wall decoration in the dance hall. I look at my reflection and notice that part of the top of my virtual dress has slipped down to my waist. Everyone in the dance hall could see my breasts! My face immediately turns red. I am flushed with embarrassment and reflexively raise my arms to cover them. I turn to Master who just smiles at me and did not do a thing to help me. He looks a little embarrassed, too.<br><br>We promptly leave the dance hall and step outside.<br><br>"Master, what happened to my dress?"<br><br>"I am sorry, slave Marissa. I guess I did not do a very good job putting it together. I was in such a rush in the limo, I guess I ran out of time and did not have a chance to test it before letting you go out on the dance floor."<br>"Oh Master, all those people saw me. What do we do now?"<br><br>Master pulls out his PDA, plugs the USB cable into my shield, and promptly fixes my dress. I am decent again.<br><br>"Thank you, Master, for restoring my virtual dress. Can we leave now?"<br><br>"Oh no, we still have to stay and see how we placed. We might have received an award or something."<br><br>"Master, I can’t go back in there. It’s too shameful."<br><br>"Now slave Marissa. Remember what we talked about self-dignity. You can still be dignified without any clothes. If you go back in there and face those people, your dignity will return. Now let’s go."<br><br>I can’t disobey an order from Master. I bow my head and walk back in.<br><br>All the other theater arts couples are lined up on the dance floor. The dance organizers are ready to announce the winners. They always start with sixth place and announce the winners last. Master and I stand in the line-up with the other couples. They announce the sixth place couple, who walk up to the judges and take their trophies. Then the fifth place couple, then the fourth, and third, who all do the same. Now, it is just us and another couple. I am surprised we’ve made it this far. I am sure they’d disqualify us for some wardrobe malfunction technicality. For second place, they announce the names of the other couple, which means we’ve come in first! The crowd cheers again loudly. After we pick up our trophies and sit down, several people come up to us to congratulate us.<br><br>"When your top came off, I thought that was the neatest trick. How did you do it?"<br><br>"You have such beautiful breasts. Showing them off was a crowd-pleaser."<br><br>"I like how you were able to slip the top off, without using your hands, then slip it back on again in the middle of the routine, then slip it off again. That looked so cool."<br><br>It goes like this for the rest of the evening. Just about everyone loves us. Before, I thought the ballroom dance community is so conservative. I guess I was wrong.<br><br>After the competition ends, Master and I stop at a nice restaurant for a late dinner and to serve as sort of an apology for the wardrobe mishap. We eat a fine five-course meal: cheese stick appetizer, tossed green salad, minestrone soup, filet mignon and lobster tails, and strawberries with vanilla ice cream. I start to feel better about the whole thing, especially when all those people paid us compliments. Master was right. Maintain your dignity, and life is not so bad.<br><br><i>Current rank: Second Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 5<br>No. of virtual outfits: 6</i>`

                    content: `Master and I are enjoying each other’s company in his office. As a second class slave, I am not allowed to have sexual intercourse with him--at least not yet. However, kissing and hugging is fun. My pussy shield is turned off at the moment.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, I would like to show you a little something." He takes out a very small remote control and presses a button. I fedl a slight tingling sensation in my pussy. I begin to shift in my seat to compensate. The tingling increases to a buzz. I am starting to breathe hard. The vibration steadily increases, forcing me to stand up.<br><br>"Master, my pussy!" I yell.<br><br>Master presses another button, and the vibrations stop. My pussy shield is still.<br><br>"Do you like it, slave Marissa?"<br><br>"Master, were you doing that?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Oh, you’re so sadistic." I quip.<br><br>"It’s my latest invention. Now I can discipline you anytime, anywhere I want, all with the push of a button. I did not even have it on maximum. If I did, you would be on the floor doubled over, begging for mercy."<br><br>"You’re REALLY sadistic." I quip.<br><br>Sally and I were promoted to second class slaves just over two years earlier and are looking ahead for the final promotion to the coveted first class rank. Sometimes at midnight, she and I head out the front gate with no batteries in our pussy shields and run around the neighborhood for a bit just to stay in practice and to prepare for the big first class nudity final exam. Whenever I hear a car coming down the street, it is so easy for me to react--ducking, hiding, sprinting--it all seems so easy now. As I am running naked down the street, I think back as to how far I have come. When I first arrived here as a new recruit, retrieving the mail in the nude was the toughest trial of all time. Now I think nothing of it. Some of the apprentice slaves watch us with envy and aspire to be where we are. Master and Katherine have been monitoring our progress. One day, Katherine approached Sally and me.<br><br>"You two are like peas in a pod."<br><br>"Thank you, Mistress." I respond. "Sally and I are really good friends."<br><br>"Yes I can see that. You have been helping and encouraging each other to prepare for the big exam, which in Master’s opinion feels you are ready to take, tonight!"<br><br>Sally and my eyes open wide. "Honest, Mistress?" we both ask. "You really think we are ready?"<br><br>"Yes, I do. Master and I have already discussed it. We have found good drop-off locations for each of you. I suggest you eat well and get some sleep before tonight. You’ll need the energy."<br><br>"Yes Mistress. Thank you, Mistress."<br><br>After dinner, Katherine blindfolds me in the four-door coupe. Sally is going with Master in the convertible. As Katherine is driving me, we talk.<br><br>"I am really looking forward to how your little adventure tonight is going to turn out. I am sure you will have some wonderful stories to tell. This reminds me of my first class exam. I was walking down a dark street, when a man came right up to me and asked me what I was doing. I did not see him coming. There was no warning. Even though it was dark, he was close enough to clearly see me naked. The first thing that came to mind was ‘Oh, I am just going for a walk.’ so that is what I said. I said it so naturally and calmly that he believed me and went on his way. I did not break stride and just kept up my casual walk. It worked so well, I did it again one more time before finally reaching the mansion. I still can’t believe to this day that they believed me."<br><br>"Well, why wouldn’t they believe you, Mistress? You told them the truth. You really were going for a walk."<br><br>"Yes, I guess so. I guess they weren’t the types to be offended."<br><br>We reach my drop-off point. Like before, I remove my battery and hand it to her. And like she did before for my second class exam, she helps me out of the car while I am still blindfolded and escorts me to my final spot where I will begin my long trek home. Katherine removes my blindfold and gives me the biggest hug.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, I will see you back at the mansion. Good luck."<br><br>She gets back in the car and drives off.<br><br>Just like my third class exam, I have no idea where I am. The first thing I have to do is orient myself and find out where I am. All I can see at this moment are a lot of trees and a dirt parking lot. I turn around and see more trees. There is a small dirt trail, but I have no idea where it leads. It might take me farther away from the mansion or closer. I just don’t know. That completely helpless and vulnerable feeling I have is overwhelming me. All those quickie nude runs with Sally over the past few weeks did not prepare me for this. I have been away from taking any sort of final exam for promotion for too long. This is my toughest exam yet. No one is coming to get me. I have to get home naked. If I find clothes or got offered any, I have to refuse them. I can’t call the mansion for help. They would come and get me if I do, but I will fail the exam as a result. I also can’t get arrested.<br><br>I decide to stick with the open road and head in Katherine’s direction. Walking on pavement is much easier on the feet than walking on dirt trails. I am isolated out in the woods. Other than the road I am walking on, I see no sign of civilization whatsoever. Except for the stars in the sky, it is almost totally dark. The rulebook said the drop-off was at least five miles away, but they could have dropped me off at a greater distance. I just didn’t know yet.<br><br>I have been walking this paved, winding road for a long time now. I am heading downhill, which I see as a good sign. I have to assume I am up in the mountains and that heading downhill means I am getting closer to the valley and home. It must be late. Not a single car has driven by all the time I’m walking. It just seems like an endless road. It is getting cold. My fingers and toes are very cold. I have to keep moving to stay warm.<br><br>Finally, I see a light off in the distance, a sign of civilization. As I approach, I can see it is a porch light for a house out in the woods. They have a very small 100 yard driveway off the main road. I can see a few other lights around the house as I get even closer and finally pass the house. As I continue walking I begin to see other houses. They are very spread out. I suppose if you want to live out here, you also want some elbow room and privacy. Next I see my first street light on the main road. The road also widens and becomes a two-lane road with a yellow center dividing line. I seem to be heading toward the main street of a very small town. Again, I still neither see nor hear cars and signs of life. This is a good thing.<br><br>As I approach the town, I can see several commercial buildings and private businesses, all closed up and deserted for the night. I start looking for a pay phone when suddenly a middle-aged heavyset man comes out of a building right in front of me. We are about ten feet away from each other and notice each other immediately.<br><br>"Well, hi there, miss. Can I help you?" the man asks.<br><br>"Hello sir, can you tell me where I am?" I respond.<br><br>"You’re in the town of Suziville," he says. "If you don’t mind me asking, what are you doing out here all by yourself and without any clothes?"<br><br>Suziville is almost 15 miles away from the mansion. They made this tough for me! I think back to Katherine’s experience when she took her first class exam, so I casually say, "I am just here for a walk and to visit your town."<br><br>"Well, if you don’t mind me sayin’ little lady, it’s kinda late to be doing any shopping. We’re all closed up for the night. And as for your state of undress, I think it might be a good idea to put something on. It’s gettin’ chilly."<br><br>The man is right. It is getting colder, and I am starting to shiver. The man goes back inside and returns with a large blanket. He holds two corners up to me with both hands. "Here ya are, little lady."<br><br>"I’m sorry, sir. I cannot take your blanket. Thank you anyway." I respond politely.<br><br>"Well suit yourself. I’ll just leave it on this chair in case your change your mind."<br><br>As he is putting the blanket down, I ask, "Excuse me. Could you tell me where I can find a pay phone?"<br><br>"There’s one just across the street in front of the restaurant."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Folding my arms in front of me in an attempt to keep warm, I cross the street and find the pay phone. Before I left, I memorized George’s phone number. Master is right. The rulebook says you can call someone for help during a nudity exam but not before as Sara did. I pick up the phone and attempt to call George collect.<br><br><ring, ring, ring, ring><br><br>"Hello."<br><br>"Yes, please put me through to George at 555-4567."<br><br>"One moment."<br><br><ring, ring, ring, ring><br><br>"Hello, this is George. If you are listening to this message, it means I am either not near my phone or on another line. Leave a message at the beep." <beep><br><br>"I am afraid there is no one there." The operator interrupts.<br><br>"Thanks anyway." click<br><br>Just then the middle-aged man comes walking towards me. "Hey little lady, everything all right?" He asks.<br><br>"I was trying to call a friend to come pick me up." I reply.<br><br>"You sure look awfully cold. I tell you what. Why don’t you come over to my place?  You can warm up there. In fact we can warm each other up, if you know what I mean." The man has an evil look in his eye. I don’t like the look of it.<br><br>"No thank you. I think I’ll just stay here and keep trying to call my friend." I firmly answer.<br><br>"Well all right, but if you change your mind, I am just up the road and to the right. I live in the one-story red house with the rocking chair on the front porch."<br><br>The man walks away. I am glad he is gone. He is making me nervous. I sit on the curb and curl up trying to keep warm. My fingers, toes, and nipples are numb.<br><br>Goosebumps are all over my body. I can’t stop shivering. This is no fun at all. There is no way I can walk home 15 miles. I am going to have to ask someone to help me. There is that dirty man up the road, but I don’t trust him. I would try George again later.<br><br>After what seems like an hour, I try calling collect again. This time George picks up.<br><br>Operator: "You have a call from Marissa."<br><br>George: "Marissa? Marissa who?"<br><br>Marissa: "George, it’s me the naked woman!"<br><br>George: "Oh yes, I remember now."<br><br>Marissa: "Hello, George."<br><br>George: "Hi Marissa, how are you?"<br><br>Marissa: "Cold. Very cold."<br><br>George: "Cold?"<br><br>Marissa: "Yes, and I need your help, I am stuck in Suziville with no clothes, and I was wondering if you could come and get me. I am at a pay phone in front of the only restaurant in town."<br><br>George: "It’s kind of late, almost 10:30. I don’t know."<br><br>Marissa: "George, please. I have no clothes, no money, no transportation and no place to stay. I am stuck out in the cold and need help. You’re the only friend I can trust to help me."<br><br>After further begging, George finally agrees to come get me. He says he’ll be here in a half hour, maybe 45 minutes. We hang up. I sit back down on the curb and resume my curled up position anxiously waiting for George. After what seems like a very long time but probably within his estimated time of arrival, he pulls up in his vehicle. I smile at him and quickly get in.<br><br>"George, thank goodness you came. I was beginning to think you weren’t going to make it."<br><br>"Oh, I was on my way as soon as we hung up. I got here as soon as I could."<br><br>"Can you turn up the heat, please?"<br><br>"Yes." George turns up the heat full blast.<br><br>George starts driving me back to the mansion. I breathe a sigh of relief knowing that I am going to make it back without further incident.<br><br>"So, Marissa. How did you get stuck all the way in Suziville without any clothes?" George asks.<br><br>"Well, if you must know, a friend dropped me off there."<br><br>"Why would someone do that? Just leave you naked like that?"<br><br>"Well, it’s kind of complicated."<br><br>"Try me."<br><br>I wasn’t sure I should tell George about my life as a naked slave, but then he did go out of his way to come help me. And the first time he helped me he did not try to take advantage of my situation.<br><br>"I am a slave for a very wealthy man. He requires all his slaves to be naked at all times. He gets a kick out of dropping us off naked somewhere."<br><br>"Sounds like you lead an exciting life."<br><br>"It definitely is not boring. My Master is a wonderful man, and I have made friends with many of the other slaves there. He treats us all very well."<br><br>"Well, that’s cool. How did your Master get to be so rich?"<br><br>"He is an inventor. He created these pussy shields."<br><br>"Oh, yes the pussy shield."<br><br>Before long we arrive back at the mansion.<br><br>"George, I want to let you know I really, really appreciate all the help you have been."<br><br>"You are welcome. Marissa, I find you very attractive. You have a beautiful body, and I would like spend more time with you."<br><br>I can tell that George is very sincere and sweet. Part of me wishes I could spend more time with him but that would compromise my time and energy and loyalty to my Master.<br><br>"George, you’re so sweet. I really like you, too, but I belong to my Master."<br><br>George looks down into the steering wheel. He looks depressed.<br><br>Feeling sorry for him, I offer him an alternative. "George, if you want, I can give you a quick hand job."<br><br>"Really? You would do that for me?" George says with a surprised look.<br><br>"Yes, I would."<br><br>I pull open his pants and begin stroking his cock with my hand. He orgasms after several minutes.<br><br>"Marissa, that was great."<br><br>"I’m glad you enjoyed it."<br><br>George and I look at each other for a couple of minutes in silence.<br><br>"I really have to go. Thanks again for driving me."<br><br>I get out of the car and wave to him. He drives off.<br><br>Inside the mansion, I let Master and Katherine know that I am home. Sally returns the next morning before breakfast. She hooked up with two lesbian women who enjoyed vacationing in clothing optional resorts. That evening we have the slave promotion ceremony.<br><br>Sally and I both received our purple-colored, virtual maid uniforms, the insignia of a first class slave. Since I returned to the mansion first, I get to have sexual intercourse with the Master first. My arms are strapped, and I am elevated two feet above the ground. A two-foot spreader bar is strapped to my ankles separating my legs. Master unlocks my pussy shield, flips it up, and lowers me down onto his cock. I had never in all my life had any object as large as Master’s cock inside me, nor had I ever had any cock inside me. It hurts a little, but I try to relax as much as I can. He starts rubbing in and out. Soon, we both orgasm. It is the most fantastic feeling in the world. For a brief moment, I forget I am even restrained and just believe that I am floating on air. I have given my virginity to my Master.<br><br>When we are finished, all the slaves applaud, and then it is Sally’s turn. She is restrained just as I was and has sexual intercourse with the Master just as I did. Like all the other slave promotion ceremonies, lower-ranked slaves kiss our buttocks, and Sally and I kiss Master and Katherine’s feet.<br><br>After the ceremony, we all go upstairs to the ballroom for the reception. As first class slaves, Sally and I receive special gifts from the Master, related to our specialties. As a landscape architect Sally receives a framed certificate of her landscaping license. I receive ballroom dance shoes, real ones, with black leather uppers and suede soles! Another tradition for all newly minted first class slaves is the demonstration of our specialties. Sally decorated the ballroom earlier with all kinds of floral arrangements. Even though she is not a florist, she is the closest thing we have to one and did a wonderful job. Huge bouquets elevated on three-foot marble columns line every corner of the ballroom. Vines hang from the ceiling. The tables have smaller floral arrangements on them and lining their edges. The place is beautiful.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, it’s time to demonstrate your specialty," Master says to me. Wearing his tail suit, he pulls out his remote control and switches my virtual outfit from the first class maid uniform to my yellow ballgown. I put on my dance shoes. Master motions to Katherine to turn on the music, and we dance our solo waltz routine. When we are done, everyone applauds. We also dance the other four standard dances, then switch to the five Latin dances with my virtual Latin outfit. What an evening!<br><br>After the reception, Master walks Sally and me up to our own bedrooms. The greatest perk for first class slaves is that each one gets her own private upstairs bedroom in the mansion. No more sleeping in the basement on bunk beds. First he shows us the two bathrooms that all the first class slaves share. It is a regular bathroom with sink, toilet, and bathtub with a shower head, marble countertop, tile floors, large mirror, medicine cabinet and drawers under the sink. It’s an ordinary-looking bathroom, but a real luxury compared to the locker room-style bathroom facility that I had been using for the past few years. This is heaven. I will be able to take my own private baths in that bathtub.<br><br>Master shows me my bedroom first. The room is 15'x18' with vaulted ceilings and purple carpeting, the same shade as my maid uniform. A queen-sized bed is on the far wall and has a brand name spring mattress, 600 thread count cotton sheets, comforter, and pillows on a solid oak bed frame with head board and foot board. Matching solid oak nightstands flank both sides of the bed. The room has a small closet, but it was empty. A full length mirror is on one wall. My very own remote control panel with optical reader is on another wall. The walls are painted with different pastel colors.<br><br>"Master, the room is lovely. Thank you so much." I say as I give him a hug.<br><br>"You are welcome. Sweet dreams, my slave."<br><br>Master and Sally then proceed to her new bedroom.<br><br>I close the door, then throw myself onto the big bed. It feels sooooooooooo sooooooft.<br><br>From the <i>Slave's Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>First Class Slave </i></em></strong><br><br>As a first class slave, you have made a long-term commitment to the care and well-being of the Master and his household. You have also chosen a specialty, so that you can make a greater contribution to the mansion and so that the Master can enjoy you all the more. You will be expected to serve as an authority in your specialty and teach the less experienced slaves, apprentice slaves and recruit slaves. You will be allowed to leave the property without supervision. You will have your own bedroom upstairs in the mansion.<br><br>Over the next few days I learn Master’s sleep schedule. In order for him to sleep with all first class slaves, Master posts a sleep schedule, which is essentially a calendar with a slave’s name on each date. Sometimes Master goes on a business trip and adjustments have to be made. But, for the most part, the schedule follows a cycle. He spends one night with each slave, except for the head slave who gets two nights in a row. When a cycle is done, it starts over again.<br><br>Almost every time Master sleeps with me, we have sexual intercourse. He unlocks the pussy shield in bed. We have sex, usually missionary style. Then he promptly locks my shield back up. Sometimes we lie in bed and talk afterwards, but most of the time he falls asleep. On the rare occasions when we don’t have sex, we would stay awake for a while and just talk.<br><br>Life is good.<br><br><i>Current rank: First Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 5<br>No. of virtual outfits: 6</i>`

What happened?"<br><br>"The Master and Mistress Katherine. They have been kidnapped." Linda exclaims.<br><br>"Kidnapped" we respond in unison. "How?"<br><br>"We were on our way back from the store. No, I mean the restaurant. Yes, that’s right. It was after we ate. We were in the parking lot getting ready to get in the car, when two people, I think it was a man and a woman, jumped us. One of them hit me over the head with a stick and pushed me into the van. Then they forced Master and Katherine into their car and drove away. It happened so fast."<br><br>"We better call the police. Jackie, you’re head of security. Would you please?"<br><br>"Yes, I will," Jackie replies.<br><br>Linda says that they left her a note, "WE WILL CALL YOU AT NOON TOMORROW TO DISCUSS TERMS. DO NOT CALL THE POLICE. OTHERWISE THE DEAL IS OFF."<br><br>"Jackie, hold the call on the police." I say.<br><br>"But we need to call them. They know what to ..."<br><br>"No police. We can handle this." I respond with authority.<br><br>We listen to Linda tell the whole story, which isn’t much. The two kidnappers were dressed in black and wore masks. Linda doesn’t remember the color, make or model of the vehicle. She didn’t get the license plate. She can’t remember how tall they were; although she says that the man was taller than she. Linda feels awful about the whole thing and guilty that she could not do more to stop them.<br><br>I try comforting her. "Linda, this was not your fault. There is nothing you could have done. You were taken by surprise, and there were two of them."<br><br>"You’re right, Marissa. Thank you for the reminder." Linda says tearfully.<br><br>The whole household is in chaos with Master and Katherine’s kidnapping. Most of the slaves are upset; some in tears. Laurie is probably the least affected, because she hasn’t been there as long. I am just angry.<br><br>"Jackie, you are going to answer the phone, right?" I ask.<br><br>"Me, why should I answer the phone?" she replies.<br><br>"Because you are in charge of security."<br><br>"I am Master’s bodyguard. My training is for when Master is being physically assaulted. I defend him. I have never handled a kidnapping before. You answer it."<br><br>Jackie is physically strong and fit. I guess I assumed she would know what to do, but I suppose she had never been in a situation like this before.<br><br>"Jackie, do you know how to use the tracing equipment?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes, Katherine showed me once."<br><br>"Set it up. We are expecting a very important phone call tomorrow."<br><br>Shortly before noon, all the slaves gather around the phone to anticipate the upcoming phone call. I am sitting next to the phone ready to answer it. Exactly at noon the phone rings.<br><br>'ring, ring'<br><br>I answer, "Hello."<br><br>"Hello this is Sara."<br><br>"Sara?! What do you want?!"<br><br>"I want what is rightfully mine, my share of the estate." Sara replies.<br><br>"Your share of what?"<br><br>"Fifteen million dollars should cover it."<br><br>"Do you have Master and Mistress Katherine?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes, they are here."<br><br>"Let me speak to them."<br><br>Sara hands the phone to Master. "Hello."<br><br>"Hello Master? This is Marissa."<br><br>"Slave Marissa."<br><br>"Yes, it’s me. Are you all right?"<br><br>"Yes, Sara and her brother are holding us."<br><br>"What about Katherine? Is she okay, too?"<br><br>"Yes, she fine and here next to me."<br><br>Sara takes back the phone. "I want 15 million dollars delivered in cash to me by tomorrow Noon. Do you understand?"<br><br>"Yes, how do we deliver it?" I ask.<br><br>"We’ll let you know tomorrow at 11:00 am." <click><br><br>Sara hung up the phone, and I do the same.<br><br>"Jackie, did you get it?" I ask her with anticipation.<br><br>"No, not enough time to complete the trace. Sorry." Jackie replies.<br><br>"That’s okay. We still have tomorrow." I reply with confidence.<br><br>I tell all the slaves to continue their duties and assure them that we will do all we can to ensure Master and Mistress Katherine’s safe return. I then enter Katherine’s office to start looking at bank papers and making phone calls to local branches. I have only one day to get all the money. I also go into the Master’s office...<br><br>At 11:00 am the next morning, the phone rings.<br><br>"Hello."<br><br>"Hello Marissa."<br><br>"Hello Sara."<br><br>"Do you have the money?"<br><br>"Yes, I do."<br><br>"Good. Meet us at the Acme Warehouse on Fourth Avenue at noon. You know where it is, don’t you?"<br><br>"Yes, I know where it is."<br><br>"We’ll be waiting. Come alone, and remove the battery from your pussy shield. I don’t want you hiding anything under those virtual clothes of yours. Got it?"<br><br>"Yes, I understand." <click><br><br>Shortly before noon, I pull into the Acme Warehouse. Since this is a Saturday in an industrial area, the place is deserted. I have the only car in the parking lot. I get out of the four-door coupe with a briefcase. I remove my battery from my pussy shield, so I appear naked, and place the battery in the glove box. Ken comes out to the parking lot holding a rifle to meet me and make sure I am alone. He is wearing black from neck to toe. We walk to the door of the warehouse, slowly open it, and walk in. On the far end I see Sara standing over Master and Katherine. Sara is dressed all in black from neck to toe. Master and Katherine are both sitting down next to each other and are tied up in hard wooden chairs with rope. Both of them are naked and look helpless and tired. I start walking towards them. Ken walks behind Katherine and stands next to Sara. Sara is holding a .35 caliber pistol.<br><br>"Slave Marissa, it is so quaint to see you again," Sara says sarcastically and with an evil grin.<br><br>"I see nothing quaint about it." I reply.<br><br>"Is that the money in the briefcase?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Put it down."<br><br>I put down the briefcase.<br><br>"Back away." orders Sara.<br><br>I back up a few steps. Sara comes forward, fetches the briefcase, then returns to her original spot behind Master and Katherine.<br><br>She opens it up and finds lots of money. She smiles and says to me, "Good work." A moment later, the expression on her face changes. She places her hand on her pussy and starts to bend over. Katherine is also not feeling too well and starts to moan in agony. Soon, both of them are screaming in pain. Sara drops to the floor covering her pussy with both hands. Ken turns towards Sara to find out what’s wrong. Out of nowhere, Jackie runs towards Ken and tackles him from behind like a football player. She is wearing her jujitsu outfit. Quickly, I run towards Katherine and pull her chair away from the action. Jackie quickly grabs both the rifle and pistol away from the kidnappers and backs up towards me. I reach behind Jackie’s back and press a remote control taped on her back. Sara and Katherine immediately feel better. With the firearms in our possession, we are able to free Master and Katherine. We take Master, Katherine, and Sara with us in the car and later turn Ken in to the police.<br><br>Back at the mansion, everyone is elated to have Master and Katherine safely home. When we are sitting at the dinner table, Jackie and I explain how we successfully rescued them.<br><br>I start, "When I was in Master’s office, I experimented with the remote control that controlled the vibrating motion of the pussy shields. I learned that it had a limited range, about five or six feet. It only worked if the remote was used close enough to the shield. I placed the remote in the briefcase with the money and rigged it so it would activate automatically when Sara opened it. That is why both Sara and Katherine were feeling pain and why I pulled Katherine away to get her out of harm’s way."<br><br>Jackie continues, "I was hiding in the trunk of the car. Ken is so stupid. He didn’t think to check the trunk when he came out to the parking lot to meet Marissa. When the coast was clear, I hopped out of the trunk and made my way to the back entrance and snuck in."<br><br>"A second remote control was taped to Jackie’s back in case we could not get to the one in the briefcase. It doesn’t hurt to have a backup."<br><br>Sally asks, "How did you know Sara still wore her pussy shield? She could have removed it."<br><br>"You’re right. She could have, but she didn’t remove it. I took a chance." I explain.<br><br>"A BIG chance." Sally says.<br><br>"Katherine asks, "So where is Sara now?"<br><br>"Down in the dungeon, locked in one of the cages." Jackie answers.<br><br>Later in the evening, Master, Katherine, Jackie, and I enter the dungeon. All the other slaves are there waiting for us. Sara is fast asleep in a locked cage. Her hands are handcuffed behind her back, and her ankles are also locked together with handcuffs. She appears naked and still wears her pussy shield. Master unlocks the cage and drags her out onto the dungeon floor, which wakes her up. Jackie presses a button on the wall to lower the chains. Master unlocks her feet then attaches them to the leather leg cuffs attached to the ends of the dangling chains. He nods to Jackie, who presses another button, and the chains begin rising Sara off the floor. When she stops, she is hanging upside down with her head about three feet from the ground. Master opens a small can of purple paint, and uses a paintbrush to paint her buttocks, pussy shield, and breasts. Jackie unlocks Sara’s handcuffs, so her arms can hang freely.<br><br>Master speaks, "Slave Sara, you have violated several rules of the rulebook, and therefore shall be extremely disciplined. Mounted on the ceiling and wall are three small laser guns pointing at you. One is pointing directly at your pussy, another at your buttocks, and the last one at your breasts. They are programmed to only shoot at an object with purple paint. Each laser is connected to a computer that will randomly shoot laser bursts of energy, on average about one burst every minute. So with three lasers running at the same time, you should get about three zaps a minute. The frequency of the zaps is random, so you will never know when the next one comes. They will only shoot at purple paint. You can use your arms to cover the paint. You get to choose what parts to protect. It’s too bad you won’t be able to cover everything at the same time."<br><br>Sara just hangs there and whimpers. She has nothing but sheer terror written on her face. Master presses another button on the wall. The lasers start zapping. Sara is really awake now and starts yelling "Ouch!" every time a laser zaps her. She raises her arms to cover her breasts but then a laser hits her pussy. She then covers her pussy with her right hand just as her right buttock gets zapped. She then moves her right hand to cover one buttock, when the laser zaps her other buttock. The lasers are relentless and merciless. Sara’s arms tire and she is forced to relax them letting the lasers have their pick of which body part they want to attack next. We all watch as Sara is tortured.<br><br>Sara cries out, "Master! Please! Please have mercy on meeee! Ow! Master! Ow! I promise to be good. Ow!"<br><br>After watching her for several minutes, we get bored and decide to leave her there. As we  climb up the stairs, I ask, "Master, what do those zaps feel like? How bad are they really?"<br><br>"About as bad as a bee sting." Master replies.<br><br>As we close the door to the dungeon, we can still hear Sara’s pleas. "MASTER! PLEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAASE! MAAAAAAAAASTERRRRRRRRR ..."<br><br>The lasers zap Sara all night, about eight hours. The second and third class slaves in the basement next door have trouble sleeping because Sara keeps screaming so much.<br><br>The next morning, Master and all the slaves meet Sara in the dungeon. The lasers are still zapping her, but Sara appears to be unconscious. Master presses the button to stop the lasers. Jackie lowers Sara to the floor. Master undoes the leather cuffs wrapped around her ankles. After a moment Sara regains consciousness.<br><br>"Slave Sara, your infractions require me to excommunicate you. You are no longer a slave of this dungeon. You shall be excommunicated at the level of first class slave, because that was your highest rank obtained."<br><br>Katherine presents Master with his piercing kit. He opens it and uses a tool to open the rings to her pussy shield. Her pussy shield is removed from her. Sara is too weak to do anything but lay there. When Master gives the tools and pussy shield back to Katherine, she puts them aside and presents Master with a can of glue and a brush.<br><br>"Sara, you like playing with glue, don’t you?" Master says with a gentle voice.<br><br>Master opens the can of glue and begins painting under Sara’s armpits and down her sides to her thighs. He and Jackie then push her arms to her sides gluing them in together. He then brushes her crotch and the insides of her legs. Jackie then pushes her legs together. Her legs are now glued together. Once the glue dries, the only ways Sara can move by herself is to either hop around or squirm like an inchworm. Master then hands the glue and brush back to Katherine and asks a few of the slaves to help carry Sara to the limousine. During all this time, a tearful and desperate Sara is crying and begging for mercy.<br><br>"Master, please! I don’t want to be excommunicated! I want to stay here with you! Please! Please! I promise I’ll be good. I want a second chance. Master, don’t do this. Don’t send me away! MASTER!"<br><br>After we place her naked in the trunk of the limo and close it, we watch the driver pull away and out the front gate. Even then, from the trunk, we can still hear the muffled cries of a woman in dire straits.<br><br>We all go back inside to celebrate and toast Sara’s official departure with champagne. Master also thanks Jackie and me for a job well done in the rescue and rewards each of us with two batteries and some promised extra nights in bed with him. Some of the slaves ask Master what will happen to Sara. Master’s only reply is, "Far away from here."<br><br><i>Current rank: First Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 7<br>No. of virtual outfits: 6</i>`

                    content: `As a first class slave, I am now allowed to leave the estate on my own and run errands for Master. One of my errands requires me to buy some items in a department store, which has multiple stories. I am projecting my casual outfit today and decide to make the trip just as the store opens at 10:00 am. About four of us enter the elevator to go up to the sixth floor. As we are making our way up, the elevator suddenly stops in-between the third and fourth floors. At first the lights go out, and it is absolutely dark. But soon, emergency lights turn on, so we have some light. The four of us wonder what is going on. After several minutes of no elevator movement, one man, who looks like he is in his thirties with light brown hair and blue eyes, tries pressing the emergency button. The alarm sounds, which I find rather annoying. Another man is in his forties, wearing a business suit, and appears rather obese. He opens a panel in the wall and picks up the emergency telephone. He speaks with someone right away and is able to gather some information. He also lets the person on the other end know who is with him, namely the four of us trapped in the elevator. When he hangs up, he lets us know what is going on.<br><br>“There’s a power outage over several blocks in the city. It will be at least an hour or two before they can turn the power back on. A whole bunch of other elevators are also caught between floors. We are not the only ones.”<br><br>Rounding out the four of us is the only other woman in the elevator. She is middle-aged, curly blonde hair, and full figured.<br><br>“Is someone going to come get us out?” She asks.<br><br>“It’s going to take a while before rescue people can get to us. By the time they do, the power may be back on and it may not matter.”<br><br>It’s just my luck to be stuck in an elevator on my first solo trip as a first class slave. At least it will only be a couple of hours.<br><br>Tired of standing, the four of us sit down in our corner of the elevator after about an hour. None of us really talk much. The obese man grows impatient and picks up the phone again. After speaking with someone, he hangs up and tells us that the power outage is worse than they thought. Power may not come back on until well into the afternoon. Everyone moans and groans at that one and starts to express how their schedules are screwed up, because of this, missed appointments, missed meetings, no food. This has turned from a minor inconvenience to a big hassle.<br><br>Another hour later, I have a panicked thought: my battery is running out. Over the years I have been monitoring my battery usage and have gotten pretty good at knowing when my battery will run out. I always know to take a spare with me everywhere I go, and this trip is no exception. Before I left the estate to come here, I figured I had about six hours left on my current battery in the pussy shield. Usually I will use the women’s restroom to change batteries, which would have been my plan today. However, I am stuck in this elevator with these three people. I could change batteries here in the elevator but would appear nude the instant I take out the old battery. It would only take me several seconds to pop the new one in, but I would rather not have three strangers, two of which are men, see me fiddling with my pussy and seeing me naked all of a sudden.<br><br>We have been stuck in this elevator now for over five hours, and I am starting to get hungry and more importantly—nervous. I have less than an hour left on my current battery. If power is not restored soon, these three people are in for the sight of their lives. The woman senses my anguish.<br><br>“Are you all right?” She asks.<br><br>“Oh, I’m fine.” I mindlessly reply.<br><br>“Are you sure? Are you claustrophobic?”<br><br>“No, I just need to go to the bathroom. I need to go badly.”<br><br>As I say that, I think to myself that that is a good excuse for looking so nervous.<br><br>After several more minutes, the power is restored, and the elevator moves again. It continues to the sixth floor as we originally intended it. The four of us are relieved and exit the elevator. I look at a clock on the wall and discover to my horror that I only have about ten minutes left to get to a bathroom. Now that things are up and running again, everyone is playing catch-up and running around frantically.<br><br>I walk up to a sales clerk and ask, “Excuse me. Could you tell me where the restrooms are?”<br><br>“Yes, they are on the other side of the floor next to the customer service desk.”<br><br>He points in that direction. I say thank you and begin a very fast walk to customer service. On my way there I am only thinking about two things: the amount of time I have left and the bathrooms next to the customer service desk. Nine minutes to go. I reach the end of the floor where the sales clerk pointed but don’t see anything. I look both ways. Eight minutes. I start walking back and forth. It’s got to be around here somewhere. People are everywhere. This aisle is blocked. I go down another aisle. Seven minutes. Six minutes. I am beginning to perspire at this point. Five minutes. Three minutes. I find another sales clerk.<br><br>“Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom, now!”<br><br>“That way, miss. Then turn left. There is a sign marked ‘RESTROOMS.’”<br><br>I start running. Two minutes. One minute. There they are! I practically throw my body through the swinging door of the restroom. I made it. Whew!<br><br>And, it was not a moment too soon. I look in the mirror over the wash basins to see my naked body. The battery had just run out. Looking around the restroom I also notice something else, urinals! I must have walked into the men’s restroom. My heart starts beating hard. I need to change batteries and get out of here in a hurry. Fortunately the restroom is empty, and I run into a stall and close it. I have privacy at last.<br><br>Anxious to get my clothes projecting again and to get out of this male territory, I quickly dig through my purse to find the spare battery. In my haste, I lift it out of the purse only to fumble and drop it on the floor. The battery bounces, then rolls out of the bottom of the stall towards the wash basins and out of my reach. I open the stall door to get it, but before I can step out, I hear two men enter the restroom. I quickly shut the stall door and hold my breath.<br><br>“How about them Dodgers?”<br><br>“Yes, how about them? Do you think they might win the pennant this season?”<br><br>“I think they have a good chance.”<br><br>They both use the urinals. When they are done, they both walk over to the wash basins and near me. I hope they don’t find my battery or step on it. As soon as they leave I can get it. But before that happens, another man enters the restroom, and then another. One of them enters the stall next to mine. Fearing that he would see my bare feet, I step up and crouch down onto the toilet. Over the next hour, men keep entering and exiting the restroom, never giving me a chance to leave my stall and retrieve my precious battery. If any one of them wanted to peek into my stall, he would find a naked woman squatting with her feet up on a toilet.<br><br>After what seemed like a very long time and when the restroom was finally empty for several minutes, I open the stall door and step out. I look where I think the battery would have ended up but do not see it. I begin expanding my search, looking near other wash basins, inside other stalls, and desperately near the urinals. Soon, my eyes have searched every square inch of that restroom floor, but no battery is found. One of the men must have picked it up. A wave of despair rushes over me. I am naked in the men’s bathroom of a department store with no spare battery. I have no way to leave without being seen. At least when Linda was stuck naked in the grocery store, she was in the women’s restroom, and I was with her. Here, I am alone, and no one knows I am here. Feeling defeated, I return to my stall, close the door, and try to solve to my predicament.<br><br>No one enters the bathroom for quite a while. It then occurs to me that it must be getting late. The department store closes at 6:00, and we did not exit the elevator until 5:00. Given the time I have been here, the store is probably closed by now, which explains the inactivity in this restroom. I wait a few more hours to make sure no sales clerks are still lingering, then leave my stall, and take a peak out through the door of the restroom into the department store. All is quiet. Everyone must have gone home. I step out and my first thought is to find a telephone. I need to call home to let them know where I am and what my situation is.<br><br>I walk through the aisles to find a cash register. Most of them have a telephone. Perhaps I can use one to call out. The fluorescent lights are still on. Clothes, clothes everywhere, but not a stitch to wear. Like the ancient mariner who is thirsty out in the open ocean, I am naked in a vast ocean of clothes. When I reach the cashier, I pick up the phone, and dial but cannot seem to dial out. Maybe these phones are for internal use only. I will have to find a payphone somewhere. Wait a minute. The customer service desk probably has a telephone with an outside line. They take customer calls all day.<br><br>I walk back to the customer service area, walk behind the desk, and pick up the phone. It still does not work. I dial four numbers, then a phone starts ringing on the other end. I don’t know why, but I decide to let the phone ring to hear what happens. To my amazement, a male voice picks up the other end.<br><br>“Security. Bob speaking.”<br><br>I freeze for a moment not knowing what to say.<br><br>“Um. Um. Uh. Hello.”<br><br>“Yes, can I help you? Who is this?” Bob says with authority.<br><br>“Um. I was trying to dial out, but I guess I misdialed.”<br><br>“Well, you need to dial 9 first.”<br><br>“Oh, I see. Thank you.”<br><br>I quickly hang up, then dial 9, then my home phone number. This time I am successful.<br><br>'ring, ring'<br><br>“Hello.”<br><br>“Hello, Mistress Katherine.”<br><br>“Yes?”<br><br>“It’s me. Marissa.”<br><br>“slave Marissa! Where are you? We haven’t seen you all day.”<br><br>“I’m still at the department store. I got stuck in the elevator for six hours and my battery ran out of juice.”<br><br>“Didn’t you bring a spare battery?”<br><br>“Yes, but I dropped it, and someone else picked it up.”<br><br>“slave Marissa, how do you get yourself into these things?”<br><br>“Oh Mistress. Please, I’m stuck naked in the department store. It’s after closing, and I need help.”<br><br>“You’re going to have to stay there until the store opens the next day. Where are you now?”<br><br>“I am calling from the customer service desk but will be hiding in the women’s bathroom next to it when you get here.”<br><br>“Okay. Sit tight and try to relax. We’ll be there as soon as the store opens. And whatever you do, don’t wear any clothes.”<br><br>“Yes, Mistress.”<br><br>Just as we hang up, I hear the elevator doors open and close. Someone is on the floor, most likely the security guy that I talked to. He probably knows I called from the customer service desk and is walking this way. I duck and hide under the desk. He walks up to the desk and looks around. Then he walks behind the desk and looks around some more. He gets to within two feet of me. I can see his legs right next to me. If he bends down and looks underneath the desk, I am in big trouble. I hold my breath. Not a muscle in me moves. My heart races. After a few more minutes, he decides that no one is here and walks away. What a relief. When I hear the elevator doors open and close again, I assume that he left the floor, so I get up from under the desk.<br><br>It occurs to me that they sell watches in this store and more importantly watch batteries. I wonder if one of them would fit my pussy shield. If I could project clothes again, perhaps I can sneak out of the store and not get in trouble for trespassing. I walk around the department store and find the watch section. Bubble packs of assorted watch batteries are on the shelves. I still have my old useless battery, which I pull out and compare to the ones on the shelves. There are so many different kinds and sizes. I don’t know which one would work, if any at all. This one looks pretty close. At least the dimensions are the same. I open the bubble pack and install the battery. Nothing works. Keeping it in the pussy shield, I start walking back to the women’s bathroom. About ten paces later, I hear a scratching noise coming from the pussy shield. I look down and notice that bottom of my ball gown is visible but I am wearing the top of my swimsuit. As I continue walking, the swimsuit starts changing color and eventually disappears leaving me looking topless. This is strange. The battery must be doing some strange things to my pussy shield. I walk a little further, and my ball gown skirt disappears, leaving me looking naked again. When I reach the women’s restroom, I decide that this battery does not work too well and take it out of my pussy shield. I hunker down for the night.<br><br>The next morning the department store opens, and Sally shows up in the women’s restroom with a brand new battery. I promptly stick it in my pussy shield, but nothing happens!<br><br>“Sally, are you sure this is a NEW battery?”<br><br>“Yes, I am.”<br><br>“Well, it’s not working.”<br><br>“Give it to me. Let me see it.”<br><br>I take it out and hand it to Sally who then takes her battery out and places the battery in question into her pussy shield. Sally’s projector activates immediately giving her virtual clothes.<br><br>“It works for me just fine.” She quips.<br><br>“But why doesn’t it work for me?”<br><br>“Did you do anything unusual to your pussy shield last night?” she asks.<br><br>“Well, I did try using different watch batteries, hoping that I could get my virtual clothes back on.” I reply.<br><br>“Did it work?”<br><br>“Not really.”<br><br>I then tell her about the strange looking outfit I got from it and that the shield then stopped projecting completely.<br><br>“Wait here. I’ll call Master.”<br><br>Sally leaves me in the women’s restroom and calls Master. While I wait, a couple of women enter the restroom and give me some strange looks. They go about their business and leave. When she returns, she has bad news.<br><br>“I talked with Master. He said that the battery you tried to use may have overloaded the circuitry in the pussy shield. He suspects that it will have to be repaired.”<br><br>“Repaired?! Sally, I am stuck in the restroom of a department store. How am I going to get out of here?!”<br><br>Sally gives me a disheartened look and says, “I don’t know.” She goes out to call Master again for advice. When she returns, she says that Master came up with brilliant plan and is sending Dr. Otis over to the department store.<br><br>“How is Dr. Otis going to help me?” I ask.<br><br>“Master did not say.”<br><br>When Dr. Otis arrives, he meets Sally outside the women’s restroom. Sally returns with a hypodermic needle.<br><br>“Sally, what are you doing with that?!”<br><br>“Dr. Otis gave it to me to inject into you. He explained to me that it will stiffen you up and make you appear like a mannequin. Then, I can carry you out of here. Everyone will think you are just a naked mannequin and think nothing of it.” Somehow the idea of being stiff as a board and completely helpless does not take well with me.<br><br>“I don’t like this idea. Let’s think of something else.” I say.<br><br>“Now Marissa, Dr. Otis had to rearrange his schedule and drive all the way over here just to give me this. You don’t want to disappoint him and worse yet our Master, do you?”<br><br>“No, I guess not.”<br><br>“Fine, then give me your arm.”<br><br>I hold out my left arm, Sally carefully injects the substance into me.<br><br>“There now that was not too bad, was it? It will take about 30 to 60 minutes for you to stiffen up. In the meantime, I will get a dolly so I can wheel you out.”<br><br>“Thanks, Sally.”<br><br>Sally leaves me alone in the restroom. Over the next several minutes, my joints and muscles become more and more difficult to move. I have to decide what position to eventually freeze to before it’s too late. I decide a neutral standing pose with arms at my sides is probably the easiest for me and for Sally, so that is my final pose.<br><br>When I reach the point when I cannot move at all, two female employees come in to use the restroom.<br><br>“Hey Charlotte, where do you want to go for lunch today?”<br><br>“Oh, I don’t know. There’s that health food restaurant that just opened up down the street. Maybe that one.”<br><br>“Okay. Sounds good. Hey, look Gail, there is a mannequin in here.”<br><br>“That’s funny. What’s a naked mannequin doing in the women’s restroom?”<br><br>“I don’t know, but we better get it out of here. You are in charge of dressing and placing all the mannequins in the store. You would not want our boss to find out there’s one in here.”<br><br>“You’re right, let’s carry it out of here.”<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>Oh no! These two women don’t know I am a real person made to look like a mannequin. I wish I could tell them so, but cannot move or speak. I am helpless.<br><br>Charlotte and Gail pick me up and carry me out of the restroom and into the main store area. The department store is busy with lots of shoppers. No one pays much attention to us. I look like a mannequin after all. I wonder where Sally is.<br><br>“I know the perfect spot for this one: the window on the south side next to the purses.” Gail says.<br><br>“Yes, I know the spot. Good idea.” Charlotte replies.<br><br>After a few minutes and an elevator ride down to the ground floor, Charlotte and Gail place me in the window so I am facing the street. Any pedestrian walking by can see me in all my glory.<br><br>“This is the strangest looking mannequin I have ever seen.” says Gail, “She looks so real. Look at those pink nipples. None of the other mannequins have nipples.”<br><br>“You’re right.” replies Charlotte, “and look at that metal plate covering her beaver. I wonder what that is for.”<br><br>Charlotte starts feeling my nipples and also my pussy shield with her hand and pulls on it a little hoping it would come off.<br><br>Gail says, “Well, we better get back to work. We don’t have time to dress it now. We’ll do it tomorrow.”<br><br>Charlotte and Gail return to their store duties. My naked body is now frozen and exposed for the entire world to see (or at least for the people walking by). I hope Sally can find me.<br><br>The hours pass and still no Sally. Where could she be!? People are walking up and down the sidewalk all day long. I have no idea how many of them are looking at me. It could be hundreds! Occasionally, a few men stop and drool at me. Even some women give me quizzical looks at my pussy shield. At least they can’t touch me behind the glass. In the evening the department store closes, but the lights in the store stay on. People can still see me. Over and over I tell myself that it is okay. I am just a mannequin and can still maintain my dignity.<br><br>A desperate Sally walks by and spots me. Here eyes widen, and her jaw drops to the sidewalk. She taps on the glass to get my attention.<br><br>“Marissa! Can you hear me?!”<br><br>Of course I can hear her. I just can’t tell her that, because my mouth cannot move. Oh, how I wish I could move. Sally continues to try talking to me but quickly finds that it is useless and eventually runs away.<br><br>The next morning, a few minutes before the store opens, Sally returns with Master in tow. They take a good long look at me, then walk into the store. Several minutes later, Charlotte and Gail move me away from the store and present me to Master and the store manager, who is standing next to him. From what I can tell, Master paid a chunk of money to the store manager to “purchase” me. The store employees cannot understand why anyone would want to pay so much money for a mannequin. I am just relieved to be back with Master and friends and to finally go home.<br><br>Sally wheels me out on a dolly to the parking lot. I am still naked and stiff as a board. Master assures me that everything is all right. We will all be home in a short while.<br><br>When we stop, we are standing next to the pickup truck. I wonder why in the world Master would bring the pickup truck. There is not enough room to fit all of us into the passenger compartment. Master and Sally load me onto the bed, then the two of them board the cab. I am now lying naked face up in an open bed truck.<br><br>As we drive through the city streets, buses and 18-wheel semis drive by and look down at me. Some of the drivers and passengers cannot help but notice my pink nipples and pussy shield. One guy in a bus even snaps a picture of me. This is an awful way to travel. All I can think of is the sooner I get home the better. I don’t care that people think I am a mannequin. They can still see me naked.<br><br>After what seems like the second longest drive of my life (the longest was my second class exam from the beach), we return to the mansion. Dr. Otis is waiting for me and injects another needle into my arm. He explains to me that I should soften up and start moving in an hour or two. I am unloaded from the truck and laid to rest in my own bed upstairs. Sally checks on me every few minutes. After a while, my limbs soften as well as my jaw and tongue.<br><br>“Sally, it’s good to be able to talk again. Thank you for coming to fetch me. I thought I would be the property of a department store for all eternity.”<br><br>“Marissa, you know we would never give up trying to find you. You are too important to us.”<br><br>Dr. Otis later comes in to check on me and makes sure I am in good health. I thank him and later thank Master as well for rescuing me in a way that did not require me to wear clothes.<br><br>Later, I spend two hours in Master’s office with him repairing my pussy shield. He “conveniently decides” that he is unable to fix it until next week, so I spend the next seven days walking around looking naked.<br><br><i>Current rank: First Class Slave<br>No. of batteries: 5<br>No. of virtual outfits: 6</i>`

                    content: `Katherine’s cancer has returned. Everyone in the estate is worried. She is seeing the doctors a lot and is having lots of chemotherapy. As the disease takes its toll on her, Jackie and I fill in to take some of her administrative responsibilities. Those business and hotel management college classes I take really come in handy. But, in spite of her best efforts and Master dishing out loads of money for the best medical care, Katherine’s condition steadily deteriorates. No one is saying it aloud, but we all know the end is near. I am at Katherine bedside. Katherine is very weak and has lost all her hair from chemotherapy. I break down in tears.<br><br>"Mistress, what are we going to do without you?"<br><br>"Slave Marissa, the estate is full of capable slaves. Part of the Slave’s Oath is to develop her full potential. One of you will replace me."<br><br>"No one can replace you, Mistress. You’re one of a kind. Master puts his brains into the estate, but you put your heart into it."<br><br>"That’s a very nice compliment, slave Marissa. I hope you can and will continue to put heart into the estate as well. In fact, I am recommending to Master that you take my place after I am gone."<br><br>"Mistress Katherine, I can’t take your job. I can’t run this place like you can."<br><br>"No, and you would not be expected to. I am me, and you are you. You would run this place with your own special style. I have not forgotten how you handled everything when Master and I were kidnapped. You took charge, got clever, and successfully saved us and Master’s money. That’s leadership."<br><br>Katherine and I hold hands and talk further. "Slave Marissa, open the bottom drawer of my nightstand. In it is something I want you to have."<br><br>I open the drawer and find a familiar picture frame with a picture inside it.<br><br>"The picture of my parents and me! Mistress, I thought I threw it into the fire during my apprentice slave ceremony!"<br><br>"No, I took it out before we had you burn all your clothes. I knew it was important to you, so I kept it for you."<br><br>I am so happy that my eyes well up again. I place my face into Katherine’s bosom and sob.<br><br>Katherine passed away two days later. Master modifies all the slaves’ virtual maid outfits to display a black armband around everyone’s arm, a sign of mourning. We all mourn. I miss her so much. A few days later, we have a funeral service out on the golf course. Katherine’s grave is near the site for the apprentice slave ceremony. For the next couple of weeks, the mood around the mansion is solemn and depressing. Morale is down. People perform their duties but without passion. No one really feels like doing anything.<br><br>After another two weeks, Master calls a meeting of all the first class slaves in his office. Jackie, Linda, Sally, and I are all standing in front of Master’s desk. Master is sitting down behind it.<br><br>"With Katherine’s passing, we are going to need a new head slave. According to the rulebook, I am to appoint one at my discretion. But, before I do so, is there any one of you who does NOT want to be head slave?"<br><br>Linda and Sally both reply. Master dismisses them. Jackie and I are left.<br><br>"This makes my decision a little easier. I will think about it in the next few days and let you know what I decide. Dismissed."<br><br>When we leave Master’s office, I begin to think what it would be like for me to actually be head slave. Can I really do it? Will I be at least as good as Katherine was? I also wonder what my chances are. Jackie has been here longer than I. I wonder if Katherine had a chance to give her recommendation to Master before she passed away. That would certainly help.<br><br>I later talked to Sally, "Sally, why don’t you want to be head slave?"<br><br>"I have a couple of reasons. One, I don’t want to compete against my best friend, and two, my passion is my landscaping work. I love Master, but when I am not with him I want to be out in the garden with my plants and dirt. Becoming head slave would take me away from all that."<br><br>Sally reminds me that Katherine used to play the piano more before she became head slave, but once she moved into a position of leadership, she did not have as much time. Running this place is a full time job. For me, this would mean not dancing as much with Master. Over the last year or so, Master and I have not danced all that much anyway. I think he might have moved on with other interests.<br><br>I ask Linda the same thing, and she gives me a similar response. She is happy in the kitchen and did not have any enthusiasm for paperwork.<br><br>A few days later, Master calls Jackie and me into his office. "I have given it much thought but have come to no conclusion. You are both well qualified. Both of you exhibit leadership well. Either one of you would make an excellent head slave. Therefore, I am going to let the two of you decide for me."<br><br>"Us? Decide for you?" I ask.<br><br>"Yes, you two are going to compete for the head slave position in the form of a race back to the mansion. It will be just like the nudity exam for first class slave. Both of you shall be blindfolded, taken to an undisclosed location equidistant from the mansion. Whoever makes it back here first becomes the new head slave."<br><br>I don’t believe this. When I made first class slave, I thought my outdoor nudity adventures were over. No more nudity exams. Now I have to do another one to become head slave. Jackie and I look at each other.<br><br>"Because this is a contest for head slave, I am going to make it more difficult. Each of you shall be handcuffed behind your back."<br><br>Master is really making this hard. On top of that, he wasn’t going to tell us how far away we were going to start. It could potentially be a hundred miles.<br><br>"The contest is tonight. Report to my office at 9:00 pm. I will drive both of you to your drop-off points myself."<br><br>From the <i>Slave’s Rulebook</i>:<br><br><strong><em><i>Head Slave Requirements</i></em></strong><br><br>The head slave is appointed at the pleasure of the Master among all the first class slaves and can be demoted back to first class slave just as easily. Only one head slave is allowed at any one time. The head slave is second in command of the mansion to the Master and runs the mansion when the Master is away. The head slave carries all the duties, responsibilities, and privileges of a first class slave, recruits new slaves, and sleeps in the master bedroom of the mansion.<br><br>Leaving the program without the Master’s consent carries the same excommunication as a first class slave.<br><br>As the head slave, it is your responsibility to lead, guide, and serve as a model to all other slaves. Lead with gentleness and compassion. Carry out discipline firmly but fairly. Always remind yourself that you are only second in command and that your Master has the final word in all matters.<br><br><ol type="1"><li>Serve as a first class slave for at least three years. (May serve less time if the opening of the head slave position is vacant and no other first class slaves have served at least three years.)</li><li>Show demonstrated leadership ability among the other slaves.</li><li>Complete the head slave ceremony.</li><li>(optional but preferred) Satisfactory complete coursework in hospitality management, business administration, and/or leadership.</li></ol><br><br>When the dreaded hour arrived, Jackie and I were both blindfolded and placed in the minivan. Master drove. The three of us reached my drop-off point first. Master helped me out of the car and walked me over to a tree in a park. He handcuffed both my hands behind my back, attached a chain to the handcuffs, wrapped the chain around the tree, then locked it with a timer lock. Master then removed my blindfold and the battery from my pussy shield.<br><br>"Slave Marissa. Right now, you are chained to this tree. I will now be driving slave Jackie to her drop-off point and doing the same to her. At exactly midnight, both timer locks will release the chains freeing both of you from the trees at the same time. You will still both be wearing your handcuffs. Make it back to the mansion before slave Jackie does and you are the new head slave."<br><br>Master then gets back in the minivan and drives away with Jackie to her drop-off point. I am now handcuffed and chained to a tree and projecting no clothes. I have no idea where I am. I will know what time it is when the timer lock releases me, but that is of little concern to me. When I was taking my first class nudity exam, I could at least take my time and wait for the right moment to make a mad dash. This time, however, I would have to move as fast as I could back home. This is also the first time I’ve been immobile. If someone encounters me, I have no way to run away from that person and would be completely at that person’s mercy. Lucky for me, that did not happen. I encountered no one during my time of tree captivity. I can see a full moon out. The night sky is filled with stars, and the temperature drops a little.<br><br>The timer lock finally releases me. I can only assume it is midnight. My hands are still wearing handcuffs in back of me. I start walking around the park hoping to find a sign or some clue as to where I am. The last thing I want to do is head in the wrong direction and lose time. Like my previous nudity exams, I am in a large wooded area. The only signs of civilization are the signs at trail forks. The names are unfamiliar. I don’t think I have ever been to this park before. Walking along one of the trails, I hear what sounds like an equestrian coming up from behind me. I promptly get off the trail and into some bushes, when I suddenly trip over something and fall over. When I look up, I am shocked to see two naked people, a man and woman, wearing pillories on their heads, hands and feet. They both look at me with equal amazement and surprise. Her head and hands are locked into one piece of wood with her hands on both sides of her head at the same level as her head and her elbows sticking out at a 90 degree angle; her feet are locked into another pillory spreading her legs about three feet apart. The man is locked in identical pillories. Thus, they are wearing four separate pieces of restraint. They are not attached to each other but look very immobile. Both of them are lying down with her on top of him. I get the impression that they were having sex until I tripped over them and didn’t want to get discovered anymore than I do. The three of us freeze as the equestrian trots by on the trail.<br><br>Then the woman speaks to me. "Who are you?"<br><br>"I am just someone out here for a walk." I reply, "Who are you?"<br><br>"We’re just out here enjoying the woods." She answers.<br><br>"But you’re naked just like me."<br><br>"Yes, we are." She confesses, "We’re actually in the middle of an S&M scene."<br><br>"Well, that’s a coincidence. So am I. My Master brought me out here. I am looking for my way home. Do you know where we are?"<br><br>"Yes, this is Cronenberg Park."<br><br>Cronenberg Park is about 15 miles from home. Now I have a pretty good idea of where I am.<br><br>"My name is Marissa. What is yours?"<br><br>"I am Violette. My friend here is Chuppecatnutter."<br><br>"Do you need help with those restraints?" I ask.<br><br>"No, I don’t think so. Besides, I doubt you have the key to open the padlocks on them."<br><br>I hadn’t noticed them before, but a padlock is on one end of each pillory locking it place.<br><br>"I see. Well, I am restrained, too." I turned around to show them my handcuffs.<br><br>"I am sorry we cannot help you." She responds.<br><br>"That’s okay. You both look like you’re worse off than I am."<br><br>"Well, it was nice meeting you, Marissa. If you don’t mind, Chuppecatnutter and I would like to be alone."<br><br>"No, I don’t mind. I need to be going anyway. It was nice meeting you, Violette and Chuppecatnutter."<br><br>"Nice meeting you, too, Marissa."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>I get up and resume walking on the trail, which seems to go on forever. Having never been to this park, I don’t know the trail system and could actually be heading deeper into the park and away from any main road. I probably should have asked Violette how to get out of here but did not think of it at the time. In time, dawn arrives, and I am still walking around. I am very tired. My feet are blistering. My stomach is growling, and all I could think of is my nice warm bed back at the mansion. I hear another equestrian coming up from behind me. Again, I quickly get off the trail and hide behind some bushes. As the equestrian approaches, I see a stark naked woman riding a horse bareback. This park sure has a lot of naked people. Given my current state of fatigue and hunger and figuring that walking up to a fellow naked woman would not be threatening, I decide to reveal myself to her and walk onto the trail.<br><br>"Excuse me. Excuse me. Could you help me please?" I ask her.<br><br>She stops to look at me.<br><br>"I could really use your help. I don’t know where I am. I have no clothes, and I need help with these handcuffs." I plead.<br><br>She senses the desperation in my voice and on my face. "Um okay." She replies, "What are you doing out here?"<br><br>"Well, it’s kind of a long story. Please I really need help."<br><br>The woman looks around, thinks a little bit, and then decides to help me. "I have a cabin not far from here. You can come with me if you want."<br><br>"Thank you SOOO much."<br><br>She and her horse continue on the trail while I follow a few paces behind. After a mile or so, I begin to fall behind.<br><br>"Wait!" I shout, "Please wait. My feet are very sore and blistered."<br><br>The woman turns around and helps me onto her horse. I am sitting behind her. What a sight we must be: two naked women riding a horse without a saddle. After another mile, we finally reach her cabin. She dismounts and helps me down. I wait for her to put her horse away in the corral then we both walk into her cabin. The cabin is small but very neat and tidy, a great improvement over the last cabin I was in with those two hoodlums who kidnapped me. Although clothes are accessible, the woman remains naked and prepares some food and drink in the kitchen. Still in handcuffs, I sit down in a wooden chair and just watch her.<br><br>"By the way, my name is Honey."<br><br>"Hi, I’m Marissa."<br><br>"Pleased to meet you. We don’t get too many other naked people out here. I was sort of surprised to see you out there."<br><br>"I have seen quite a few actually. Last night I saw a naked couple making love in the bushes."<br><br>"Oh really?"<br><br>"Yes, and they were wearing restraints on their hands and feet. Heads, too."<br><br>"You have on some restraints, too. I see."<br><br>"Yes, My Master put them on me."<br><br>"Master? Are you into bondage or something?<br><br>"Well, sort of. You see, I am a slave, and he sent me out here as sort of a test or race."<br><br>"This is sounding more and more interesting."<br><br>"I have been a slave there for a few years now. Our head slave died recently. The Master is looking for a new one, and he likes to test our resilience by sending us out naked and letting us find our way back."<br><br>"And you’re bucking to be the new head slave?"<br><br>"That’s right."<br><br>Placing a plate of food on the table, mostly assorted fruits and a scone, she motions to me to eat. I switch chairs so I can sit at the table. Unable to use my hands, I bend towards the plate and pick the food up directly with my mouth. The food is delicious, but my mouth gets smeared by blueberries, blackberries, and peaches. I surely look like a mess!<br><br>As I was finishing my breakfast, a naked man walks through the door. How many naked people are in this park? I have yet to see a clothed person since this whole race began last night. Did Master drop me in a nudist colony?<br><br>"Hi Buck."<br><br>"Hi Honey."<br><br>"Buck, this is Marissa. I found her out on the trail."<br><br>"Hi Marissa."<br><br>"Hi Buck."<br><br>Buck offers to shake my hand until I show why I can’t.<br><br>"Oh, you’re wearing handcuffs."<br><br>Honey explains to Buck how she found me and what I was doing out here. Buck listens very intently but doesn’t get freaked out or anything and offers to help me with my handcuffs.<br><br>"Yes, if you could get them off of me that would be a big help."<br><br>Buck grabs a toolbox, and pulls out some small tools for fine work. He fiddles with my cuffs for a couple of minutes, and presto: he successfully unlocks them. My hands are free at last.<br><br>"Thank you so much to the both of you for helping me."<br><br>"You are very welcome," they both answer.<br><br>"Can I ask another favor? Can I get a ride back into town?"<br><br>Buck and Honey both look at each other then back at me. "Um, you see, Marissa, we don’t have a car."<br><br>"No car?"<br><br>"No, Buck and I are both naturists and naturalists. We totally believe in the natural way of life. That’s why we don’t own any cars or clothes for that matter."<br><br>"But where did you get this food?"<br><br>"We have a small kitchen garden in the back of the cabin. We also hunt and gather other provisions. Occasionally we do need some extra supplies, so we wear clothes down to the general store."<br><br>"Well, in that case, could I use your phone?"<br><br>"I’m sorry, but we have no phone, but there is one at the general store."<br><br>I guess I should count my blessings. Buck and Honey might not have a car or telephone but were able to help me with some food and got me out of those handcuffs.<br><br>"I want you to know I really appreciate all that you have done for me. However, I really need to get going if I am going to be head slave. I am in a race to get home. If another slave beats me there, I lose out, and she becomes head slave."<br><br>"We’re glad we were able to help you. Good luck."<br><br>Buck and Honey verbally give me directions out of the park. We say goodbye to each other, and I walk out of the cabin. I am still naked, but at least I am no longer wearing those dreaded handcuffs.<br><br>I follow their directions and make it to the edge of the park. On the way, cyclists, hikers, and joggers come by on the trail, and I do the usual get-out-of-the-way-in-a-hurry routine when they get near me. I have gone as far as I can until dark. The paved road is too open and exposed for me to walk during the daylight. I sit in the bushes and wait. It would be at least a full day of me being out there naked. For all I know, Jackie made it back already and is the new head slave. If that’s the case, I might as well call home and have them come and get me. However, I have no way of knowing, so I have to continue on my own.<br><br>After dark and when I feel the road is deserted enough, I come out and start walking along the paved road. After a couple of miles, I see additional signs of civilization: more buildings and homes. I also look for a payphone. I might be able to call my friend George and have him come and help me like he did for my first class nudity exam. But so far I’ve been unable to find one. My feet are extremely sore at this point. Walking is just downright painful. If I don’t find another means of transportation soon, I will have to stop, and call home, and forget about being head slave.<br><br>After another couple of blocks I see a row of bicycles parked along a bike rack. Maybe I can steal one of the bikes and cycle home. I walk over and try to find an unlocked one. Yes, one is not locked. I pull it out and hop on. The seat is a little high for me, but my toes can still reach the pedals. I begin cycling and reach a speed of 20 to 25 mph. This is great. My feet aren’t taking a pounding anymore, and I am moving much faster now. I also know where I am and estimate I will be home in a couple of hours at the rate I am going. Cycling naked feels wonderful. The wind brushes all over my naked body. It also seems to be late enough at night that I don’t see any cars or pedestrians. If I do, I will just keep cycling as hard as I can until I pass them.<br><br>I am now cycling next to a row of parallel parked cars on a residential street. Without warning, a car door swings open right in front of me. Kaboom! I crash head first into the car door and fell over my bike. My left side of my body scrapes along the pavement for a few inches.<br><br>"Ouch!"<br><br>A man steps out of the car with a shocked look on his face. "Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?"<br><br>I lay on the ground a moment in pain.<br><br>"Hey, you’re not wearing anything."<br><br>Without saying a word, I slowly start to get up and assess my wounds. The man squats down and tries to help me. "What are you doing out here naked?"<br><br>"I was on my way home."<br><br>"I’m sorry I did not see you. The street was so dark, and your bike did not have a headlight."<br><br>I sit up and decide nothing is broken. My left side has some scrapes and bruises but nothing serious.<br><br>"That’s all right, I think."<br><br>He takes off his jacket and hands it to me. I decline. "No thank you."<br><br>"Are you sure? I don’t want you to get into any trouble."<br><br>"No really. It’s all right."<br><br>I get up and pick up my bike. The front wheel is completely mangled. There is no way I can continue riding it.<br><br>"I am really sorry about your bike. Can I give you a ride home?"<br><br>At that moment, a light dawns in my head. A ride home!<br><br>"Yes, absolutely! I would be very grateful for a ride."<br><br>"Hi my name is Larry."<br><br>"Hi Larry. I’m Marissa."<br><br>"I have never had an auto accident with a naked woman before. Are you some kind of nudist?"<br><br>"Yes, I guess so."<br><br>"Wow. That’s cool."<br><br>"Larry, if you don’t mind, I would like to get home. If we could get going..."<br><br>"Oh yes, of course."<br><br>Larry picks up my bike and puts it halfway in the trunk of his car. It doesn’t completely fit, and part of it sticks out. I get in the passenger front seat and buckle up. After tying down the trunk with some rope, Larry joins me in the driver’s seat. He looks at me like he’s hit the jackpot. As we are driving, I consider getting into this accident a hidden blessing. Now I can get home even faster, as long as Larry drives me directly home. He and I exchange the usual pleasantries, like where we live and what we do for a living. I don’t mind telling him I am a slave and that I enjoy streaking. Larry doesn’t seem to mind. He also doesn’t seem to mind glancing down at me. He does it so often that I have to remind him twice to keep his eyes on the road. I had already been in one accident that night. I don’t need another.<br><br>After 25 minutes, we pull up to the front gate of the manor. "Marissa, can I have your phone number?"<br><br>"Um, how about if you give me yours. I’ll call you."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>Larry pulls out and hands me his business card.<br><br>"Thank you, Larry, for the ride."<br><br>"Oh no, Thank you for letting me drive you home. The pleasure’s all mine." He then proceeds to get out of the car, presumably to get my bike out of the trunk, but I interrupt him.<br><br>"Larry, you can keep my bike."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"Yes, consider it a gift."<br><br>"Um all right. Thanks, I guess."<br><br>Larry closes his car door and stays in the car.<br><br>I open the door and get out.<br><br>"Bye, Larry."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>Larry waits for me as I ring the doorbell. Sally answers it and lets me in. Larry then waves at me and drives away. Sally and I give each other the biggest hug.<br><br>She whispers in my ear, "Congratulations."<br><br>"What? Don’t tell me Jackie isn’t here?"<br><br>We stop hugging and we look at each other.<br><br>"Oh she’s here, but she is not the new head slave. You are."<br><br>"How? What happened?"<br><br>"Come into the house. Everyone is waiting."<br><br>Sally and I walk into the entryway where all the slaves and Master are waiting. They all immediately give me a round of applause and cheers. Jackie is also standing among them clapping but doesn’t appear quite as elated as everyone else.<br><br>Master and the other slaves start hugging and kissing me and saying congratulations to me. I am overwhelmed by the reception and a little confused.<br><br>"I don’t understand what is going on. Jackie is here, but you are all congratulating me as the new head slave."<br><br>"Jackie was disqualified." Master explains.<br><br>"Disqualified?"<br><br>"Yes, she got arrested earlier today. She called from the police station, and we bailed her out."<br><br>I turn to Jackie, who looks a little dejected. "Oh Jackie, I am so sorry."<br><br>Jackie just looks at me and says, "Congratulations, Mistress Marissa. I got a little careless and was not paying attention. Someone must have seen me and called the police and had me arrested."<br><br>"Oh Jackie, I am so sorry." I repeat.<br><br>"Well, she is safe with us now and so are you, head slave Marissa." Master announces.<br><br>We later learned that an undercover cop saw her running down the street. He ran after her and arrested her. At the police station, she was forced to wear an orange jumpsuit. However, under the rulebook, Master did not cite her with an infraction and therefore did not have to be disciplined. Getting ridiculed and embarrassed at the police station was discipline enough.<br><br>The promotion ceremony for head slave is the following night in the dungeon. Master and all the slaves are in a circle. As usual, the slaves are all decked out in their maid uniforms. Master takes his place behind the podium and speaks.<br><br>Master: "Welcome to the ceremony for slave promotion. Tonight we celebrate the promotion of a worthy individual to the highest slave position. Our new head slave has distinguished herself in honesty and dignity through her nudity. I remember when I first met her. It was by the pool. She was young and naďve and very self-conscious of her body. But over time she overcame all that. Now she runs around naked like it was a walk in the park. And, as many of you know, she has walked naked in many parks. Even in the face of adversity, she was able to overcome difficult circumstances and rise above them. She faced abuse through another slave who is no longer with us. She organized the rescue of me and slave Katherine when we were kidnapped. I would not be here today of it was not for slave Marissa."<br><br>Master turns to me. "Slave Marissa, I owe you my life. This estate owes you its life. And I cannot imagine anyone better worthy to be head slave than you."<br><br>I am overcome with joy. My eyes begin to well up.<br><br>Master presses a button on his remote control to turn off everyone’s pussy shields. All the slaves appear naked. He then motions to Jackie to lower the chains and leather cuffs from the ceiling.<br><br>Master: "Slave Marissa. It is now time for you to receive the insignia of your new position."<br><br>I walk to the center of the circle and lay on the floor face up. As before, when I was promoted to third class slave, my ankles are strapped in, and I am taken upside down. My head hsngs two feet from the floor. Jackie takes two leather cuffs and puts each of my hands in them and buckles them snuggly. She then runs a rope from the D-ring of each cuff to an eye bolt anchored to the floor, then ties knots and tightens them so that my arms are outstretched. I am now in an inverted spread eagle position. Master walks in front of me. Jackie holds his piercing tool kit. Master opens the three rings to my silver pussy shield and removes them and the shield. For the first time in almost five years, my pussy is completely naked and free of hardware. But that doesn’t last long. After cleaning my pussy with an antiseptic wipe, he places a golden pussy shield over me with three new rings and closes them in place. The bulge on the inside of the new pussy shield goes twice as deep into my vagina as the previous one did. I am now wearing the one and only golden pussy shield for head slave. Master steps back to the podium, and Jackie lets me down. I return to my place in the circle.<br><br>Master is now standing on the pedestal. He grabs the remote control, and presses another button. All the slaves are projecting their uniforms again. I look down to see my black maid uniform with full-length skirt, the insignia of head slave.<br><br>Master: "Slave Marissa, as the new head slave, you must recognize my authority. Come and kiss the feet of the one who is superior to you."<br><br>Just like before, I kneel down and kiss Master’s feet.<br><br>Master: "Now all slaves must recognize and acknowledge the new head slave."<br><br>Master steps off the pedestal. I step up on it and bend over. Every slave kisses my buttocks then returns to her place in the circle.<br><br>Master: "This concludes the ceremony for slave promotion. Everyone give a round of applause to our new head slave."<br><br>Everyone turns to me and applauds and cheers.<br><br>After the reception that evening, Master and I spend some time in his office. He transfers all my virtual outfits from my old pussy shield to the new one. He also escorts me up to the Master bedroom, where we make passionate love that night.<br><br>The next day, I am sitting in my new office learning to find everything. Jackie comes in to see me. "Mistress Marissa. May I see you a moment?"<br><br>"Yes, slave Jackie. Please come in."<br><br>"Mistress, I want you to know there are no hard feelings. I wanted to be head slave but you won fair and square. I know you are very dedicated to this estate and love the Master very much."<br><br>"I am glad you feel that way, slave Jackie. I hope we can work together and still be friends. You are an excellent body guard and will protect Master well."<br><br>Jackie smiles. I get up, smile, and give her a hug.<br><br>Jackie and I talk some more, but then a buzzer goes off on my desk.<br><br>"Slave Jackie, I am expecting someone at the front gate. If you will excuse me."<br><br>Jackie leaves my office. I head out to the front gate projecting my head slave maid uniform. When I reach the gate, I see a very young-looking redhead with freckles. Appearing no more than 18 years old, she is about five feet one inches tall and very slender. Wearing ordinary street clothes, she holds her luggage in one hand.<br><br>I speak to her, "Hello, you must be Anne."<br><br>"Yes, I am here to answer your ad in the paper for a maid."<br><br>"Yes, we have been expecting you. Please come in ..."<br><br>Current rank: Head Slave<br>No. of batteries: 6<br>No. of virtual outfits: 7`

                    content: `I am sitting on a stool posing nude for my portrait. Master wants an oil painting of me to hang next to Katherine’s in his office. The painter he hired is the same one who painted the large nude painting of Katherine. He is very good at capturing the beauty of his subjects. Posing for a portrait is actually a little tiring and time-consuming. As I am sitting here, I reflect back on my life.<br><br>I have been the head slave now for almost 20 years. Even though I am in my forties, Master still thinks I am beautiful. I have become his confidante. He tells me everything. Well, just about everything. Master and I don’t dance too much anymore. He is off inventing new gadgets, while I am busy managing the household. I earned my bachelor’s degree in hotel and restaurant management at the local university. It took me six years taking classes part-time. I later earned my MBA in hospitality management.<br><br>I manage all the slaves here, which are many. We have slaves for so many specialties now: golf pro, swim instructor, librarian, a vintage dance partner for Master, a sous chef for Linda, assistant gardeners for Sally, just to name a few. In fact, we have had so many slaves join us and promote to first class, we had to build an annex to the mansion to give each first class slave her own bedroom. Master sleeps with them all, which means I sleep with him less often. At least as head slave, I get to sleep with him two nights in a row when I do get him, while all the first class slaves sleep with him only once per rotation.<br><br>Sally still lives here and has become my best friend. Elegant Gardens magazine did a feature story on her work here, and she has won a few landscaping awards over the years. The front cover of one issue shows her laying naked on a bed of roses, with petals covering just her private parts. It was the magazine’s best-selling issue. We still go on midnight naked streaks together sometimes. Jackie is still here and still practices her jujitsu. She occasionally enters tournaments. One time, an opponent kicked her groin in a sparring match, which damaged her pussy shield. She appeared naked to everyone in the auditorium and was forced to forfeit the match, because the judges would not let her compete in the nude. Linda still cooks here and has her own cooking show on an erotic adult channel, called <i>Naked Cooking</i>. The show emphasizes using natural ingredients in all her recipes. Sometimes she does the show completely without projecting any clothes. Viewer ratings are always the highest on those broadcasts. George graduated from college with his graduate degree in engineering and went to work for Master’s company. Occasionally, he comes over to the mansion to help maintain our pussy shields when Master does not have time or traveling for business. Maria, our token nudist, never promoted past third class slave and still frolics around the property without any batteries in her pussy shield. Bethany fell in love with one of the maintenance men on the property. I feared that Master might get mad and excommunicate her, but he had compassion for her and simply let he go. The wedding took place here. Master even designed a virtual wedding gown for her. Her pussy shield was removed, and she now lives a regular clothed life in town with her husband and two kids. I still see them in the grocery store every now and then.<br><br>Every anniversary of Katherine’s death, I bring flowers to her gravesite. I also sit and talk to her and let her know how I am doing and how Master and the rest of the slaves are doing. I miss her.<br><br>Occasionally I glance at the picture of me with my parents and wonder what they would think of me and my life here. All I can think of is that I am very happy here, happier than I have ever been. Master treats all of us very well. I have not worn a stitch of clothes in almost 20 years and would not have it any other way.<br><br>Deep in the jungles of the People’s Republic of Ankolasa, a country in Africa, where no white man has ever set foot, a hundred dark-skinned, naked natives are repeatedly bowing in unison in one direction and chanting, "Oobe gobala. Oobe gobala. Oobe gobala. Kakriita gotoerow" over and over again. In front of them, Sara is sitting stark naked ten feet up on a makeshift throne. Scar remnants appear in the inside of her arms and armpits and on the inside part of her legs. She smiles over her dominion. "Oobe gobala. Oobe gobala. Oobe gobala. Kakriita gotoerow. Oobe gobala. Oobe gobala. Oobe gobala. Kakriita gotoerow." means "Hail. Hail. To the white goddess with golden hair. Hail. Hail. To the white goddess with golden hair."`
