            <p>Frost on the window pane and the delicate dance of fire in the fireplace crackled together in blissful harmony. Garland wreathed across the mantle and around the Christmas tree sparkled and shone with an almost unreal quality, like light itself skipped from branch to branch, from hearth to heart. As a rerun of a 60s stop-motion Christmas flick pandered away on the TV, Candice hugged Mallory tighter. Snuggled up on Christmas Eve with the girl she loved, cozy as can be, nothing but the two of them and the spirit of the season. Could life get any better?<br><br>Nestled into Candice on the couch, Mallory stretched an arm out to pluck a handful of popcorn from a bowl on a coffee table. She popped a kernel into her mouth, followed by another… then quickly flicked the final up at Candice! Prepared, however, Candice opened her mouth and caught it in a smug, satisfied bite!<br><br>Mallory gasped very dramatically. “You’re adapting!”<br><br>Candice chomped with a grin. “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice-“ Mid-triumph, however, another piece of popcorn flew up and hit Candice square in the cheek. Mallory giggled mischievously.<br><br>“You!” Smile betraying her mock outrage, Candice wrapped her arms tighter around Mallory’s midsection to roll on top of her. Mallory cackled and pretended to struggle! Then their eyes met, and the laughter softly tapered into rapture. Light glimmered across Mallory’s blue eyes, so blue and deep as one would dream of an ocean. Her eyes slowly closed, as did Candice’s, as their lips drifted ever so closer together…<br><br>TRIIIIINGGG! The doorbell trilled crisp and clear. <br><br>“Oh!” Mallory broke away, not even clocking Candice’s grimace in her puppy-like excitement! “That’s gotta be her! Go get the door!”<br><br>It took actual effort for Candice not to groan as she slid off Mallory. “Yeah, yeah.” Candice gave Mallory’s hand an affectionate squeeze before clambering over the couch. “Save me at least a little popcorn, will ya?” Mallory just smiled wide and shrugged like there was no guarantee.<br><br>Promptly, Candice hopped over to the front door and yanked it open. “Hi, merry Christmas- WAHH!” Candice shrieked and shielded her eyes! Emma was at the door alright, but - save for a Santa hat, festive mittens, and waterproof boots - the redhead was BUTT NAKED!<br><br>Emma smiled blithely as if nothing was amiss. “Merry Christmas!”<br><br>“What the hell!” Candice recrossed her arms over her face. “Why are you NAKED?!”<br><br>Idly crossing one leg over the other, pale skin pinkish with the cold, Emma shrugged in a way which made her perky bosoms flounce. “It’s how we did it last year! Thought it was our little tradition!” Emma then pushed the bake tin in her hands into Candice’s arms. “I brought fruitcake!”<br><br>Candice moved her hands just enough to see what Emma was prodding her with. She then quickly took the tin and closed her eyes! “Did… did you walk all the way here like that?!”<br><br>“Pfft, no!” Emma bent down and picked up a dropped, thigh-length winter coat, rustling it until Candice got the hint to open her eyes again. “And I got some sweats in a bag, here.” Emma lifted her other hand to show. She beamed and stood taller, as if proud of the full frontal nudity she was shining Candice’s way. “Just wanted to get a reaction out of you! Now, can I come in, please? Freezing my ass off here…”<br><br>“Ugh, yeah, come in!” Candice stepped aside as Emma hugged both her coat and bag over her front and sidled past. Despite the gesture like she was (belatedly) preserving her modesty, when Emma slid inside past Candice, she turned her back towards Candice instead of away! Probably trying to rile her up more, Candice figured, sneaking a glance at the redhead’s tight tushy as it wiggled by. You’d think it wouldn’t be such a surprising sight anymore, what with how many times Emma appeared au natural these days, but she always managed to find some way to catch Candice off-guard… although no doubt that was the game she was playing… She could call Emma an exhibitionist, but that wouldn’t be wholly true since it’s not like Emma got some illicit thrill out of flashing people - the annual Christmas parade came by, she’d be begging to race inside! What Emma was above all else was a button pusher, doing as she did to provoke reactions from her friends; she just had no issues using nudity as a means to that end. And there was something in that itself, that cavalier attitude towards being naked that was one of Candice’s buttons! First time seeing her in a few months, and Candice gets an eyeful of rich redhead junk…<br><br>As Candice pushed the door shut, she heard footsteps from the living room. “Hi! Merry- oh!” Mallory giggled into her hands. “I didn’t realize this was gonna be a tradition, now…” Her coat still held over her front, Emma performed a sarcastic half-curtsy, fluttering her eyelashes at Candice specifically. After all, Emma hadn’t been the only jaybird last Christmas Eve…<br><br>“It is NOT tradition!” Candice blushed. “She brought clothes, which she is going to put on! She’s just being stupid.”<br><br>Emma made a face at that. “Yeah yeah, I’m changing, I’m changing.” The redhead hesitated, then motioned at the other two. “Do you mind? I’m indecent.” Emma insisted down at the coat shielding her nudity, as if she hadn’t shown up at the front door with everything proudly hanging out! <br><br>Scoffing, Candice took Mallory’s hand and pulled her back into the living room, so Little Miss “Reaction” could get modest. They got as far as the Christmas tree before Candice noticed Mallory stifling small giggles. “Don’t encourage her!”<br><br>Mallory’s smile faltered. Her brow wrinkled, confused. “It’s just a joke. She’s getting dressed, what’s wrong with it?”<br><br>“No, I know, it’s- it’s…” Candice’s turn to falter, suddenly cognizant of how fired up she’d gotten. “Just… just want to make sure she doesn’t spoil the mood too much. It’s Christmas, after all, not ‘Naked Day.’”<br><br>Mallory shrugged and plopped down on the couch to unpause-pause the movie so it didn’t turn itself off. “She’s just being silly.” A sly smirk. “We knew what we were asking for by inviting her.”<br><br>Candice folded her arms. “Yeah…” She grumbled to herself. We. We invited her. Candice hid her sour grapes with a glance out the frost-patterned window. Not that she suddenly hated Emma or anything! Emma’s great, she loved Emma! What an insane difference a measly year can make! This time last Christmas, if pressed for her opinion on the redhead, Candice would’ve cussed out who she knew as a snobby, greedy, thickheaded bully who wouldn’t know sympathy if it bit her on the pale, pompous ass! But in the three hundred and sixty-five days since, Emma had completely inverted that opinion, being a genuinely compassionate, supportive, and all-around incredible friend, about the best Candice had! Maybe still a bit thickheaded, but at least her intentions are much purer than before! Though she could be exasperating, Candice wouldn’t give up her friendship with Emma for anything! The thing is… she had kinda been hoping to spend Christmas Eve with Mallory… just Mallory. It was their anniversary for crying out loud! Okay, maybe not technically in terms of them being together romantically, but it was the anniversary of their first kiss! And this would be their first Christmas together, at least in the sense of being… y’know… together. Especially after how off-script things had gone last year, Candice was eager for a proper do-over. Again, not that last Christmas with Emma had been a bad experience! Little strange to reflect upon, of course, considering it’d involved both Emma and Candice hanging around naked as Christmas doves, but it’d been a really nice night despite that! But this year Candice had been hoping for no strangeness - no mishaps, no bizarre nudity-based detentes - just the nice, calm, jolly and holly night she’d been hoping for last time! Not that Emma’s presence would totally prevent that… but it definitely threw in a vibe more chaotic than cozy…<br><br>At least Emma was honest about putting on clothes. She’d thrown on an ugly sweater alternating beige stripes with a shade of burgundy which probably intentionally clashed with that of her hair, as well as some equally-unflattering grey sweatpants. “Alright! So,” Emma bounced past Candice and over to the couch to snuggle up to the Mallory, who gamely snuggled back. “What’re we doing?”<br><br>At the sight, Candice couldn’t help how her molars began to grind. Again, nothing against Emma. But there was some other little niggle gnawing away at Candice, and at that moment its teeth were particularly pointy… Not jealousy, understand! It’s not that she was insecure about Emma somehow unraveling her relationship with Mallory or anything - although at one point Mallory did sheepishly let slip how she thought Emma was hot, which Candice never quite got over… even though she was pretty sure Emma was straight anyway… But, regardless, Mallory and Candice loved and trusted one another, and Emma was nothing but supportive of them. Hell, to a point, she was the one who fought the hardest for them to be a couple! But that’s kind of the thing: when Candice and Mallory’s relationship hit a spot of turbulence back in the Eager Meadows days, though Emma had remained friends with them both, she wound up spending significantly more time with Mallory, what with all the stress and pressure Mallory felt in moving to a new school and partaking in theater - she’s the one who needed the most support, and Emma gladly gave it. It was a good, compassionate choice, Candice knew, but as a result, those two had solidified quite the rapport. It’d been strong before, but after that one weird summer day with the naked roller blading, it’s like the two couldn’t spend two minutes outside of each other’s orbit! Emma was with them every hangout after, she’d go to the movies with Mallory even if Candice was unavailable; even when they’d been at their respective universities for the fall, not a night went by in which Mallory didn’t share some meme or joke Emma texted! Candice would almost call them sisters… if it weren’t for that little gnawing niggle… Like… it was a long break Candice and Mallory had been on back at Eager Meadows… but Emma was straight, right?<br><br>Regardless of anything, it took barely any time at all for Candice to feel like she was getting shouldered out of her own night! Everything they did, be it bake gingerbread cookies, add more garland to the mantle, sing along to the Christmas playlist on the speaker, Emma and Mallory were practically at each other’s hip, laughing and singing, only occasionally bidding Candice to join in. They even disrupted the neighborhood’s carolers without her! Candice wasn’t sure they’d include her house on the rounds this year, not after they’d been greeted with Candice and Mallory baring their behinds at them! A pair of full moons seemed like quite the deterrent to those uppity types… Candice had been exiting the bathroom when she heard the first notes, only to hear the song halt mid-verse. Confused, Candice raced over, only to find the front door open to a gaggle of aghast carolers gasping at Emma and Mallory, bent over with their pants around their knees! The full moon tradition stays alive! The carolers hustling away in a humph, Emma and Mallory giggled and slapped at each other’s bare butts like it was the funniest thing that’d ever happened, all while Candice watched from the stairs. She would’ve actually liked to hear a carol or two this year… Part of her knew she should be happy seeing how well the two got along now compared to their horrific first encounter… but that part was barely a whisper against the selfish part of her, the part that, despite her best efforts to keep it cool, was getting increasingly upset at losing what should have been a perfect night…<br><br>The night dragged along, eventually bringing the trio back into the living room to enjoy their fresh gingerbread cookies alongside another classic Christmas TV movie. At first Candice tried to relax and take in the animated antics, excited that she once again got to cuddle with Mallory on the couch… but even that was hard to enjoy when Mallory was leaning off her every five seconds to laugh at some comment made by Emma over on the nearby recliner, or to offer her part of a cookie, despite Emma having easy access to the plate on the table. Candice put on a smile and fake-laughed along… but every passing minute, Candice’s dander felt more and more akin to the logs in the fireplace, gradually dimming and diminishing… every little comment and giggle rankled her nerves more and more… She didn’t want to feel this upset, but it was so hard… What finally put her over the top was when Mallory tore off a small chunk of her cookie and convinced Emma to open wide so she could try tossing it in her mouth. Candice nearly groaned out loud when that happened! Rate she was going, she was gonna get a brand new aneurysm for Christmas…<br><br>Conscientious of her mounting displeasure, Candice’s ear caught on something, or rather the lack of something. Beneath the quiet whistle of wind should’ve been the Santa decoration on the roof whirring and wheezing, as all the moving parts duly moved. At the moment, however, Candice couldn’t hear it. Was it a minor thing? Absolutely. Was it an excuse to break from this whole ordeal? Double absolutely. “Sounds like Santa’s stuck again.” Up and off the couch, Candice pulled a coat off the rack and opened the front door. “I’ll fix him.”<br><br>Mallory sat up, frowning. “Wait, really? It’s so late, though! He’ll thaw in the morning.”<br><br>“It’ll be just a second,” Candice ignored. “Want him to look good for the parade when it passes, anyway.” And so Candice slipped outside, shutting the door on Mallory’s follow-up protest. It made her feel guilty, doing that, but Candice kept on. A little fresh air and a chore to busy her would temper her temper. Plus, she always felt more ‘present’ in cold weather. She didn’t want to be this upset, and that feeling of being trapped to it in and of itself was upsetting! Is this not an important night? Did it not mean as much for her as it did Candice? Whatever, gotta calm down. Trying to put all her focus on getting this simple task done, Candice brought up the ladder she kept around the side of her house for this very task, then carefully climbed up to fix Santa.<br><br>The “Santa” in question was an impressive decoration, a large display of the big man in his sleigh with all eight reindeer accounted for, all mechanized to have their legs pumping, and for Santa to be waving a sign that read “X-MAS.” With festive neon outlining the wire frame, Jolly Old Saint Nick could be seen from the end of the street! It’d been an early gift from Claire - on one of their weekly calls, Candice sighed about lacking ‘real’ Christmas decorations, and so Claire had whipped up a ‘little something’ and sent it Candice’s way! The handmade effort made it all the more impressive; the detail in Santa’s rosy-cheeked smile alone for just being neon strips on a wire frame was immaculate! Of course, while Claire’s craft had improved from the Eager Meadows days, this gift was more of a quick ‘throw-together-on-the-side’ project, and thus had a few recurrent kinks, most common of which being Santa and the reindeer locking up every so often. Usually it was due to too much snow or frost accumulating; as a safety measure (probably?) if one motor stopped then all of them did. As Candice made it up onto the roof, sure enough Kringle’s shoulder was caked in the white stuff. She clambered up, mindful of giving the gutter a bit of a berth. When she’d initially set up Santa, she’d also gone and bought a row of those icicle-style lines of lights to set up along the gutter, but they’d been bigger lights than she’d expected, creating a row of somewhat jagged bumps. That cleared, she shuffled up to the decoration carefully - the roof was very slippery with snow and ice! Kneeling down despite the cold snow, Candice began picking at the frost.<br><br>Two scrapes in, however, and Candice heard a clattering behind herself. At first she worried that the ladder had fallen, but as the sound continued she realized it was the opposite: someone was coming up. Nervous at who might be following her up to such a precarious spot, Candice stood… only to see a familiar cherry red color peek over the gutter. “Emma?”<br><br>Next thing Candice knew, the redhead was stood in arm’s reach, arms folded. “What are you doing?”<br><br>Candice backed away, gesturing. “What are you doing? Where’s your coat?” Boots aside, all Emma had on was her sweater and sweatpants, no hats, gloves, nor coat.<br><br>Rubbing her arms, Emma frowned. “You’re wearing it, brainiac.”<br><br>Candice looked down. “Oh… right…” She’d moved her own coat from the rack to the hall closet… So that’s why it felt a touch tighter around the chest… Shrugging it off, Candice returned her attention to the decoration. “I’ll just be a minute.”<br><br>But Emma didn’t so much as flinch. “What’s up with you?”<br><br>Candice kept her eyes on Santa. “What d’you mean ‘what’s up?’ Nothing’s ‘up.’”<br><br>“Says the girl out on her roof in below freezing weather.” Though clearly shaking from the cold, Emma took a step closer and nearly had her foot shoot out right from under her! “Whoa!” She quickly steadied herself, then again confronted Candice. “Something’s eating you. Spill.”<br> Candice continued to pretend to work. “There’s nothing wrong.” Which was the truth. An evasion, but the truth. She was just in need of an attitude adjustment… and Emma’s overwhelming presence was preventing said adjustment.<br><br>Emma didn’t back down. “You’ve barely said a word all night. You won’t have any cookies, you turn down the music, and now you’re up here at like ten at night freezing your bubble buns off. Just tell me what’s up.” A beat. “We’re worried.”<br><br>*We’re* worried. Talking for both of them now? Candice’s fingers wrung the wire that comprised Santa’s elbow and almost yelled, “Why worry? Nothing’s wrong! Everything’s going just fine! We’re all here, you’re all laughing, everything’s great!”<br><br>Emma refolded her arms less to warm herself and more in confrontation. “Stop with the friggin’… whatever you’re doing! What, is it me? You got some problem with me?”<br><br>Candice turned back to the redhead. “What if I do?”<br><br>Emma’s jaw dropping was audible. “Then you come out and say it to my face like a big girl.”<br><br>Like a big girl?! Taken aback, Candice scoffed and returned to Santa’s side. “Just go back inside and let me do this, already! And here, take your coat back!” Casting down the zipper and swinging the coat off her shoulders in a single motion, Candice flung the winter coat in Emma’s direction. The immediate temperature drop was bone-chilling, but Candice maintained stolidity as she returned to Santa’s side, working in just her beige t-shirt and black sweatpants. Barely a second after crouching back down, though, not even half a swat through, Santa and the reindeer jolted back into action, the latter pumping their legs and the former waving his sign with cheer. Candice let a loud groan escape. Of course the one time she wanted to be out here fixing this thing, it wouldn’t take more than a second! Whatever. Couldn’t stay out forever, at any rate. Let’s endure some more ‘season’s tidings.’ The moment she stood, however, Santa and the reindeer abruptly went still yet again. Candice frowned. What the hell? Why did it feel like the universe taunting her, at this point…<br><br>“Hey!” Emma yelped. Candice glanced over, and she understood what exactly had happened. To catch her thrown coat, Emma had stepped to the side, and in doing so had erred so close to the decoration that one of the foremost reindeer’s joints had jammed on the leg of her sweats! “Oh goddammit!” Emma jerked her leg to the side to no avail before tossing her coat onto the rooftop to pry with both hands. “Gah, it’s totally stuck!<br><br>Candice tapped her chin in amusement that was less fake than she’d admit. “I mean… you could just take off your pants. You seemed perfectly happy without them earlier.”<br><br>It was hard to tell if the pink in Emma’s cheeks was from the cold or from embarrassment. “I’m not leaving these expensive sweatpants on your roof! ‘Sides… I didn’t bring underwear…” But that part was pretty obvious… The way the side of her pants had been tugged down, the entirety of Emma’s right hip was exposed, all pale skin getting pinker in the cold - had Candice been behind the redhead, she’d undoubtedly be glimpsing half a butt cheek peeking out.<br><br>Candice frowned. “Oh, cos you’re so modest?”<br><br>Emma frowned back. “Look, Scrooge, can you just help me with this? Before we both turn into popsicles out here?” <br><br>Another groan, this time one Candice managed to stifle. “Yeah, yeah…” Rubbing her arms, Candice shuffled a step closer… just to get poked in the back! “Ow!” As Candice glanced back to see what had happened, she nearly got pulled off her feet! “Whoa- whoa!” Stumbling upright, Candice finally got a sense of the situation: though the reindeer had jammed up with Emma’s pants getting caught, Santa’s arm was still waving away without her realizing! Why didn’t his thing stay stopped?! She’d walked right into range of Santa waving his “X-MAS” sign, and the corner prodded her between the shoulder blades! Worse yet, a bit of wire in the corner bent and protruded, and it dug into the back of Candice’s shirt!<br><br>“GWAK!” Candice stumbled as the sign began swinging back in its arc, pulling her shirt tight over her chest and throat in doing so, before pushing her back the other way! “AH! Stop! Stupid thi- AH!” Though Candice maybe could have successfully reached back to unhook herself on stable footing, the constant movement coupled with the slippery rooftop made it impossible! Before long, Candice couldn’t even stand upright, dragged this way and that as her feet uselessly pedaled along the icy rooftop! “Gah! Ah!” She felt like she was in some never-ending falling gag! Kicking her legs as she did, as well, Candice inadvertently caused her baggy sweatpants to slide down her legs, exposing her candy-cane-striped underwear to the elements!<br><br>Finally, one final slip sealed the deal! “WHOA!” Candice fell butt-first to the rooftop and immediately squealed! “EEK!” That’s a cold heinie! Her pants had sagged so low her entire panty-clad posterior was out, and the cold bit straight through the thin, festive fabric! Her scrambling bought her no purchase, and within moments Candice began sliding down the icy shingles! Her shirt, however, remained stuck on the sign, the buxom blonde sliding right out of it! “GAH! Cold!” Candice yelped as her bare back made contact with the snowy rooftop! She hadn’t worn a bra! Her big bare boobies were exposed! In an instant her rosy pink nipples puffed up, as goosebumps covered her bare torso! But she barely had a second to let the embarrassment of winding up topless to sink in - she was still sliding! <br><br>“No no no no!” Candice scrambled to stop herself, but there was nothing to grab! If anything her flailing made her pick up speed! Within seconds she’d slid to the edge of the roof, with no means of slowing down! She’d hoped maybe the bump made by the lights lining the gutter might be pronounced enough to cut her momentum, but she just skimmed right over! “AHHHH!” Candice squealed as her legs went over the side, followed by the rest of her! In an unfortunate way, however, Candice got her wish! True the lights and the uneven bump made by them wasn’t enough to stop her… but it was enough to hitch on the back of her exposed panties!<br><br>“KYAHHHHHHHHH!” Candice wailed, as she dangled from the two-story rooftop by her red and white striped underwear! Oh God, how it HURT! She’d seen Claire in a similar scenario back at EMAGS, but Candice had no sense of just how painful it could be until she was experiencing it firsthand! The relentless pull of gravity dragging her full weight down, cotton mercilessly burrowing up her ass and splitting her lower lips! It just kept digging deeper and deeper, like a scalding between her cheeks! Kick as Candice did out of instinct, the pants which had sagged to mid-thigh dropped ever lower down her legs, past her knees, down her shins, around her ankles, Candice’s legs too numb from the cold to notice the sensation! A few more good kicks, and the baggy sweatpants were down and off her feet, fluttering down gracelessly to the lawn below! Rendered all but naked save for the underwear suspending her, Candice squealed and shivered, as her undies kept sawing between her bouncing, meaty cheeks! “KYAHH!”<br><br>Having been so preoccupied with her own predicament, it took until Candice’s wail for Emma to look up and witness Candice’s plight! “Oh crap! Hang on! I gotcha!” With greater urgency, Emma pulled to unjam her sweatpants. Pull as she did, however, her sweats remained stuck! “UGH! Fine. Playing for keeps it is.” Emma grumbled as she moved her hands up from the decoration to her waistband and pulled down. She wasn’t thrilled having to do it, but if it was the only way to get to Candice in time, then so long, pants! And so, hard as it was with her pants partly trapped, Emma wiggled and wormed her sweats down best she could. Even when the waistband just cleared her hips, the freezing wind on her ass and her you-know-what was a shock to the senses! But Emma worked through it to fight her way out of her sweatpants! With them pulled as they were pulled, Emma could only work them down to about mid-thigh. Oh God, her boots too! It’d be impossible to strip off these pants with them on! Grumbling more obscenely, Emma bent best she could and untied the laces on her boots before kicking off the left, then the right to over where she’d left her coat. In doing so her socks had slipped off too, but Emma let them stay in the boot. Bare feet would be way more freezing, but she was NOT dealing with soaking wet socks! Probably end up worse for her anyway… With the boots gone, Emma moved to then lift her legs up and out of her pants. A pretty straightforward task… were it not for the fact that the roof was super icy and slippery! But she had to try… Grabbing hold of Donner or whichever reindeer was at the front with her, Emma slowly lifted her left leg up. Shivering from a harsh wind whipping her vulnerable butt cheeks, however, combined with the slippery roof, almost right away she fell off balance!<br><br>“GAH!” Emma face-planted into the snow, only to immediately jump up onto all-fours! Yow, that’s snow where it shouldn’t go! Sitting back on her knees and brushing snow off her sweater and her privates, Emma looked back to see the waistband of her pants all the way down at her ankles. Well, that’s the less graceful way of doing that… Kicking out of the cuffs, Emma crawled out of her stuck pants, the grey legs blowing plaintively in the wind. Emma fought a third grumble. Twenty degrees on Christmas Eve, and she was up on a rooftop, naked from the waist down! And giving the neighborhood quite the show… A van with an evergreen leashed to its roof trundled by on the road, and Emma couldn’t tell if it slowed down or not to catch a peek of her ass. She could hear Christmas music faint in the distance. Was that the parade? If they didn’t hurry up and get inside, Emma had a feeling a lot more than one car would be seeing a full moon on Christmas Eve, maybe even more… She tried to stand but almost slipped again in trying! And so Emma crawled on all-fours to reach Candice, trying to block out the petrifying cold starting to numb her legs! “H-hang on C-C-Candice!”<br><br>‘Hanging on’ wasn’t so much a choice for Candice at that point! Though she tried to reach up and grab the gutter, her awkward backwards position and the ice made getting a hold on anything impossible! All she ended up doing was lifting herself up just slightly, then dropping back hard against her undies, making dig up her sensitive spots even harder! Worse, all her thrashing accomplished was stirring snow to slip off the roof after her, to pile up down the back of her panties! “Gah- AH!” A strange mix of searing discomfort and numbing frigidity paralyzed her patootie like she’d never experienced before! It was like her ass crack was sore, but she also couldn’t feel it anymore?! Her butt cheeks were totally numb! Black spots speckled the edges of Candice’s sight! This ache… how much longer would she-<br><br>Suddenly, a sound not dissimilar to cracking ice cut through her foggy mind, but it wasn’t ice! As Candice abruptly sagged an inch lower - her undies conversely stretching an inch higher up her hoo-hah! - she realized her underwear wasn’t gonna hold out much longer! And, sure enough, not even two seconds later another tearing sound and sag, before the fabric between her legs abruptly tore and sent Candice plummeting! “AHHH!”<br><br>“Candice!” On her hands and pantsless knees, Emma had slowly been shuffling over to Candice, having finally gotten near arm’s reach when Candice’s panties tore and sent her falling! Instinctively Emma reached after her, but in doing so on such a slippery, icy surface sent herself off balance! “Whoa- WHOA!” Unable to achieve any purchase to clamber back up, Emma soon followed Candice over the edge! “AHHH!” As the redhead slid, another protruding bump of the gutter-lining lights dug into the knitting of her sweater, right in between her breasts! Digging in a deep snag, Emma plummeted into the bushes below… but her sweater didn’t follow her!<br><br>Poof! Poof! Both girls landed in neighboring bushes in puffs of powder. Groaning, both rolled out and onto the lawn, Emma flopping face-first and Candice on her back. It took Candice a moment to regain lucidity out of the lingering ache and the freezing snow swallowing her whole body. When it all caught up to her, she sat up, shivering. She’d lost her glasses and ponytail scrunchie in the fall, but found the former within arm’s reach. Even though she knew damn well all that had happened, putting on her glasses to make it all so crystal clear what happened. So angry as to be in disbelief, Candice hugged herself and glanced behind at the impromptu snow angel she’d made in her flop. It was a near-perfect outline of her body, marred only by her climbing out… there was even two perfectly round, deep, concave marks at the hips, where her butt had been… Recognizing this and brushing the snow out of her ass crack, Candice grit her teeth and nearly screamed. Here she was yet another Christmas, outside her house, out in the snow, missing her clothes! Only this time losing her pants wasn’t enough! This time - save for shoes - she was head-to-toe, au natural, birthday suit NAKED! Exactly what she wanted to NOT happen! Freezing, shivering, yet paradoxically past her boiling point, Candice balled her fists and blurted, “This wouldn’t have happened if you weren’t here!”<br><br>Just as nude as Candice, Emma sat in the snow, shaking out her hair, apparently more preoccupied with it than the snow clumped along her perky bust and between her legs. Upon hearing, however, she froze. “…what?”<br><br>Realizing the severity of what she’d said, anger abruptly fled Candice. “Oh… no, I- I didn’t mean…” A sigh. She did kinda mean it… “I just…” Another sigh. “You wanna know what’s eating me? Last Christmas was a really special night for me and Mallory. It was that night we… we figured out how we felt about each other. Or, at least, were supposed to have…” Candice shrunk into herself with a shiver. “I messed up last time. But this time I know that I love her like that. I just… I just wanted that perfect night for us to be together. In love. For good this time.” A third sigh, and a second shiver. “But she went and invited you like it didn’t matter.”<br><br>“Oh.” Emma responded softly. The redhead went quiet, then, standing but not even brushing snow out of her hair or the clumps acting as perfect censors for her naughty bits, just standing and shivering with her eyes on the ground.<br><br>Guilt welled up in Candice’s freezing tummy. “I-… I’m sorry, Emma. I didn’t mean anything by it.”<br><br>“No, I… I wasn’t even thinking about y’all.” Emma tapped her chin and looked down at the snow like the answer could somehow be studied from the powder. “Mallory didn’t invite me. I kinda invited myself. I guess, just… Y’know, I didn’t even think about it. Christmas was… well… not really something I ever had before. Every year Dad always took Mom to these big glitzy company Christmas Eve galas, while… while I stayed home alone. I’d open my gifts and just play with them until they got back or I fell asleep. And then when I got old enough to go with them… I mean…” Emma shrugged. “I didn’t know anybody there. There weren’t any other kids my age. Hell, even if I went now, what do I even do at a place like that? Didn’t really feel like Christmas. S’posed to be about being together, right? Family? They’d go off drinking and laughing… and I’d just be back where I started: waiting.” Despite a somewhat bitter tone, a smirk touched Emma’s lips, like it was kind of funny in retrospect. “But then last year was different. For more reasons than one.” The smirk became cheeky. “Last year I wasn’t alone. I was spending time with people who wanted me there. It was…” A tremble in her voice. “It was the best Christmas I’d ever had. The only one, really.” Another sigh to swallow another tremble. Emma tilted her head to glance at Candice. “I’m not trying to guilt trip you, by the way. I just… kinda got lost in my own head a little. Sorry.”<br><br>“No, no, it’s… it’s fine…” Candice’s turn to look down, idly brushing at the snow clinging to her bosoms. She suddenly felt unaccountably embarrassed. She’d been so focused on her own special moment with Mallory, she hadn’t even considered what that night meant to Emma. That point last year, Emma didn’t even have any friends left, did she? Inviting her to stay had seemed like such a small gesture to Candice… Mallory had gotten really close to Emma, she probably knew all of this. It was probably why she brought up inviting Emma in the first place… “Emma, I… I’m sorry. I was… I was selfish, acting like I did. I just wanted what I wanted, and I…” She chuckled at herself. “I was like a child about it, I threw a tantrum! You’re right: Christmas is about being with the people you care about. And I care about you too. So I should’ve acted like it.”<br><br>Emma smiled. Her eyes shimmered - was it just frost in her lashes? “No, no, don’t go doing that. I was the one who convinced Mallory. I shouldn’t have butted in like I did. You’ve got something really special with her, and I was all ‘me me me.’”<br><br>Candice shook her head. “No. No one should be alone on Christmas, you’re not in the wrong for that. We- I should have included you from the start.”<br><br>Emma shook her head harder and spoke loudly. “Please, after all the shit I put you through at EMAGS? You don’t owe me squat. If anything-”<br><br>Candice interrupted by grabbing Emma’s hands and all but shouted, “Maybe we can both be wrong and head back inside? I’m really freezing my bubble buns off now!” Smirking, Emma glanced down at their bodies as if she’d forgotten their predicament. She then pulled Candice in for a hug. Awkward as it might have been to do so while buck naked, Candice embraced Emma tight, partly for the emotion of the moment, but also for warmth!<br><br>Suddenly, while pulling out from the embrace, Candice realized why she had needed to shout: a steadily-building noise had swollen to full volume nearby, a collective din of tinny trumpets, clacking hooves, and chugging motors. As bright, festive light crept over the pair, both turned to the street and saw the annual Christmas parade trundling by, no less than a dozen floats boasting double the amount of dancers, costumed performers, and lucky neighbors waving and prancing. At a snail’s pace the parade passed Candice and Emma…<br><br>…with both girls standing in clear view, both totally butt-ass naked…<br><br>“Oh!…” Softly gasping, Candice doubled over, both arms hugged over her chest and legs crossed to hide her privates, burning with such embarrassment she thought she might melt the snow around herself! Even though all the dancers and actors on their floats remained in character, Candice still saw them all sneaking glances, with some’s jolly expressions dampening somewhat in turn. None of the neighbors hid their recognition, however, all pointing and gasping at the duo naked in the snow! Followed by, of course, a dozen phone cameras going off! Candice’s face burned, as she recognized so many of the people from around the neighborhood, now all staring at her naked body! Candice had actually come really close to flashing this exact parade last year, having lost her pants in the middle of what she later learned to be Claire’s front yard; her only saving grace had been Emma, who’d stepped in front of her to shield her from view of the parade. Not only was Candice showing a lot more than she had last year, but Emma wasn’t going to be any help that night… Candice side-eyed the redhead and saw her with her back to the parade, one arm hugging her own chest and her spare hand held over her bare derriere and not concealing as much of it as she probably hoped, at least from Candice’s perspective. As the floats grumbled by, Emma glanced over at Candice with an embarrassed grin somewhere between apologetic and resigned. Candice just hugged herself tighter and shifted and arm to cup her crotch as Santa’s sleigh rolled by, “Ho, ho- HO?!”<br><br>—<br><br>Bundling over themselves what clothes they could recover, Emma and Candice burst through the front door to immediately run into Mallory. The parade had evidently drawn her attention, but her eye had stayed with an unexpected extra act. Mallory poorly hid a smile. “I thought that you said this wasn’t gonna be tradition!”<br><br>Throwing her pile of collected clothes on the floor, Candice groaned, albeit with a resigned smile on her face. “Guess I don’t know everything after all.” A light chuckle, as she bashfully crossed her arms. “I… I’m sorry about earlier. How I was acting. Just needed to clear my head.” She smiled in apology. “Can we get back on track?”<br><br>Mallory smiled back and nodded. “Of course. Whatever happened out there, I’m glad you’re feeling better now.” Then a slight frown. “What… what did happen out there?<br><br>Both Candice and Emma established uneasy eye contact - easier said than done, what which each girl’s voluptuous physique fully exposed to one another, the cold having made their nipples especially, distractingly puffy… but the gaze they shared carried a silent conversation. “Don’t worry about it,” Emma answered with a flip of her hair. “Just an icy patch. But I think we cleared it alright.”<br><br>“Agreed.” Candice thought a moment, then planted her hands on her hips with a smirk. “Well, now that we’re dressed per tradition, or whatever, how about we get back to it?”<br><br>Mallory peeled her eyes off Candice’s frost-dappled crotch before she nodded, gesturing Candice to follow her back into the living room. Candice did, but hesitated upon realizing she was the only one doing so. She turned and beckoned Emma. “Come on, you dope. Let’s get another movie going.”<br><br>But Emma stayed by the door. “Something tells me you should take point on this one.” Smirking, the redhead gently gestured back to the living room entryway.<br><br>Candice frowned. “What?” But then she tilted her gaze to where Emma gestured… and then she got it. Up in the middle of the entryway hung a small bough of mistletoe. And beneath the mistletoe, hands clasped and a demure yet bashful smile on her lips… was Mallory. Firelight wrapped around her body as if Mallory herself was but light, beautiful light from which no shade could cast. Emma egged her along, and so Candice smirked back and approached Mallory slowly, as if walking in a dream. Gingerly placing her hands on Mallory’s waist, Candice looked into her eyes and saw not just herself reflected, but all the good things and all the love she could ever keep for an entire lifetime. In that moment, the world blurred away, and there was only them.<br><br>Mallory reached up and brushed a snowy lock of hair off Candice’s forehead. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I should’ve asked you about her coming over.”<br><br>“It’s okay.” Candice whispered back. She was about to say more, but realized that there were no words to describe what built inside her. And so she brought her face closer to Mallory’s, until their lips finally met. Despite the cold that had racked her, a powerful warmth filled Candice full. Through harsh cold and disdain, love prevailed, as it always would.<br><br>As Candice pulled back, she glanced by the stairs to find Emma missing. On cue, she heard the upstairs shower flash on. At first Candice was a bit miffed that the redhead was making herself at home like that without asking… but she knew it was just an excuse to let her and Mallory be alone for a while, so she couldn’t be that mad. Plus, after all that, a hot shower sounded like heaven… Since they were alone, though, Candice turned to Mallory to ask a question that’d been gnawing at her… “Hey… quick question.” A beat. “Do you… do you still think that Emma… is hot?”<br><br>Mallory shrugged glibly, like there was only one real answer. “I mean… can you honestly say she’s not?”<br><br>Candice felt herself blushing. “Well, I… but you- you don’t have like… When- when we were… y’know… not together… you didn’t… like… nothing ever happened, right?”<br><br>Mallory shook her head. “No. Well, I mean… I sat on her face once.” Mallory let the sentence and Candice’s look of utter shock marinate just long enough before smiling and clarifying the accidental nature. Nevertheless, Candice chased Mallory into the living room, all but tackling her onto the couch as both girls laughed their heads off. When Emma finally reappeared, she’d treated herself to one of Candice’s robes, but considering the misfortune Candice had brought her, it only seemed fair to make it a last-second gift! Besides, both their clothes were still soaked from snow… and she appreciated the modesty, so things were at least a little less weird than last time! And so the movie resumed. Wrapped in a blanket to keep herself decent, Candice hugged Mallory on the couch while sharing a smile with Emma. In that moment, bathed in warm firelight against the harsh cold outside, with the company of such amazing people, Candice wondered how this hadn’t been her idea of a perfect night all along.</p>
