                <p>I like to burn things. I burned down my city's library once; it was an old and useless thing anyway, with many out-of-date and boring books only of interest to some obscure mages. The sight of it lit up was beautiful. Fire sparking and flowing around the building, smoke billowing to the air, and the wood crumbling and collapsing. Nobody got seriously hurt - there were some people who got smoke in their lungs, but nothing they couldn't handle. After that, I caught the bug - going from village to village, seeking out vulnerable and old buildings to burn down. I had covered my tracks well.<br><br>Which is why I was very surprised to be in the forest with a man on a horse pointing a crossbow at me.<br><br>″You are under arrest in the name of the King for the crime of arson,″ he said in a steady voice.<br><br>″Now, now,″ I said, my hands in the air in surrender. ″You have surely got the wrong woman. I'm Lara Aegmon, daughter of Lord Barrisot Aegmon. I would never do anything like arson.″<br><br>″Don't bother lying,″ said the man. ″I know it was you. You're going to come with me to answer for your crimes. Take off your clothes.″<br><br>″What?″<br><br>″I said take off your clothes.″<br><br>″Why, you pervert! You're going to ravish me. My father will hear about thi--″<br><br>He interrupted me by firing an arrow past my ear. I jerked in terror, and by the time I looked back up at him, he had already loaded a new arrow.<br><br>″Your father knows all about your hobby. He was the one who sent me. He knows exactly what I have to do here.″ He pulled a scroll from within his cloak and tossed it to me, one hand still on the crossbow. I unfurled it. It did indeed have my father's handwriting.<br><br>You have brought great shame on your family, Lara, so it's only fair that you bring great shame upon yourself. Do everything this man tells you, starting with taking off your clothes, or you will be disowned and not see a cent from my will.<br><br>I looked up at the man in horror. My father had finally done it. How unfair! How dare he ruin my fun! Nobody got hurt, not really. And now here I was, being told to submit myself to some humiliation. How could Father and this strange man do this to me?<br><br>The man nodded.<br><br>″Take off your clothes.″<br><br>I closed my eyes, my cheeks burning. I unhooked my cloak and let it fall to the ground. I pulled my shirt over my head and dropped it onto my cloak. I undid my belt and pushed my trousers down.<br><br>″Underthings too.″<br><br>″What?!″<br><br>″You're stripping all the way. You lost the right to your clothes when you burned those buildings.″<br><br>I seethed. I had known this was coming, but I thought maybe stretching it out would help. Was burning down a library really so bad? They were only books.<br><br>I undid the back of my corset and dropped it onto my other clothes. I then slipped my undergown over my head, exposing my large breasts to the man on the horse. I pulled my panties and stockings off. I stood before him, covering my breasts as best I could with one hand and my pussy with the other.<br><br>″Put your hands behind your head,″ he said.<br><br>″Oh come on!″ I cried out. Why was he taking every last shred of my dignity?<br><br>″Do it,″ he said, with the air of someone who neither wanted nor had to raise his voice.<br><br>I felt myself start to cry, and the shame of cracking under pressure compounded with the shame of being naked in the woods at the behest of a male stranger. I sobbed as I raised my hands.<br><br>″Y-y-you're a ba-bastard and my daddy is g-g-going to throw you in a d-d-dungeon!″<br><br>″I doubt it.″ He climbed off the horse and took a jar out of his cloak. He used his fingers to scoop some clear jelly-like substance out of it, spread it on his hands, and then started rubbing it on my shoulders.<br><br>″That's cold!″ I shrieked, jerking.<br><br>″Stay still,″ he said patiently. ″And keep your hands behind your head.″<br><br>I obeyed. Something about me being naked and him being clothed and his voice being so clear and yet so gentle made me obey. I felt so vulnerable and small. His hands were rough on my skin. He rubbed the cream into my shoulders and back. He scooped a little more out of the jar and applied it to my breasts, causing me to gently gasp. I scowled at him and he ignored me. Somehow the fact that he seemed to derive no sexual pleasure from touching my most intimate body parts made it worse. I was an object for him to use - like a tanner with a hide. I asked him what the cream was for and he ignored me.<br><br>He moved down my body, applying the cream to my belly. When he rubbed it into my pussy, I let out a little moan. He moved onto my legs, getting me to lift my feet one by one so he could apply it to the underside of them. He then moved up to my arms and hands. For some reason, he did not apply it to my bottom. When he finished, he picked up some dirt and sticks and then threw it against my body. It simply bounced off and I barely felt it. He nodded to himself.<br><br>He went back to his horse and pulled some rope out of his knapsack. He came over to me, grabbed me by the wrist, and started tying me up. The rope was oddly soft and comfortable. He was tying my arms behind my back, so I couldn't see what was happening; the way he did it involved wrapping the rope around my belly, so that he lead the end of it to my front. He walked around to my back.<br><br>″Try to break free,″ he said. I struggled, but it was tight. He nodded again. He carried the end of the rope and climbed up on his horse. He turned and looked at me. ″I'm going to lead the horse forward. Tell me if you fall back.″<br><br>″Wait! Can't I ride up with you?″<br><br>″No. You're being punished. You've been a bad girl. Bad girls are stripped naked, tied up, and made to walk. Oh, and from now, you're to call me Sir. Let's go.″<br><br>He got his horse to start moving, and before I could be pulled over I started rushing forward. He kept a slow enough pace that I could keep up.<br><br>I fumed. It wasn't just that anyone who walked up could see my naked body - although it was that. It was being made to feel small and shameful through everything he did. When he rubbed me down with cream, it was like being a small child getting some cure for an ailment, although nobody had ever rubbed cure on my private area. It had reminded me of my mother rubbing horrid anti-lice cream into my hair. He was an authority touching my body without my permission. He had tied my body like I was a hog he was leading around.<br><br>Worst of all was how he had done all of this. He hadn't demanded it, he hadn't forced me; he was polite but firm, expecting me to obey and allowing no debate, like a firm teacher. It made me hate him more. He was polite because he knew he could afford to be. As I walked, I scowled up at the back of his head. He was an authority figure, and I'd find a way to break him down.</p>

            { title: "Chapter 2", content: "<p>The man led me through the forest. I didn't feel cold or dirty or sore, and I knew it was because of the cream he had rubbed over my whole body. I felt a gentle warmth all over me, as if I were sitting nude in a steam room. The one exception was my butt, the one part of me he had not rubbed down. I wished I could rub my butt with my hands, but he had tied them behind my back so tightly I could barely move them. I wondered if he had left my butt exposed to the elements on purpose, just to make me suffer.<br><br>And suffering was what I was doing. It wasn't physical pain, aside from the cold butt - it was shame. This bastard was making me walk buck-ass nude through the forest. I don't deserve this. Just because I set a few fires? Nobody really got hurt. This man had handled my private areas - parts of me I hadn't shown anyone. I'm a good-looking woman, I know it. I have big boobs that men (and some women) love to stare at. I got a lot of nice attention for it - men love buying me things, and I loved letting them and then never showing them any part of me. It's a lot of fun wielding power. It wasn't right that any man who cared to could look at my whole naked body.<br><br>I scowled up at the back of his head. Maybe magic works on feeling, and if I hated him enough, his head would explode.<br><br>It was then that I saw someone was riding a horse the opposite way down the path. I hid behind the man's horse as best as I could, but then, to my horror, the horse slowed down. I heard the other rider stop.<br><br>″Hello! Nice day for it.″ It was a man.<br><br>″Indeed,″ said the man leading me around (he told me to call him 'Sir', and I wasn't going to call him that.).<br><br>″Er, you got someone tied up there?″<br><br>″Oh yes. I'm an ENF catcher.″<br><br>″A what?″<br><br>″ENF catcher. I'm a kind of bounty hunter, except when I catch them, I make them walk back naked.″<br><br>″Oh? That makes sense. Really punish them for their crimes. May I see her?″<br><br>″Of course. Lara, what are you doing back there? Get in front where the man can see you.″<br><br>″No!″ I said.<br><br>″Lara. I asked you to come out from behind my horse. Don't make me ask you again.″<br><br>″Go fuck yourself.″<br><br>″Excuse me.″ I heard him get off his horse. He walked around and when I saw him, his face wasn't contorted in rage like I expected - he was smiling politely. He carried a small stool. He pulled me towards him with the rope, then frogmarched me around the other side of the horse.<br><br>″No! No! No!″ I cried out. To my shame, I sarted sobbing again.<br><br>″Oh my!″ said the stranger. ″That is a large pair of breasts on her.″<br><br>″Indeed,″ said my captor.<br><br>″God, you've got a sexy one there.″ The stranger looked me up and down, practically salivating. I felt like an object. I could see him imagining fucking me and it made me feel so ashamed. I spat at him.<br><br>″That's enough, Lara,″ said my captor. ″You're going to get spanked for that one.″<br><br>″What?!″ I cried out. He put the stool down, sat, and shoved me over his lap.<br><br>″I'm going to spank you ten times. I want you to count each time and say 'thank you, sir'. For each one you don't count fast enough, I will give you two more.″<br><br>″What? What are you - ARRGH!″ He brought his hand down before I expected, and hard.<br><br>″How many is that?″<br><br>″Fuck you! OW!″<br><br>″You're now getting four more on top of the two you just got and the ten I initially promised. How many is this, Lara?″<br><br>″Ow! Three! Thank you, sir! Mmm! Four! Thank you, sir!″<br><br>I'm ashamed to say that I wailed. Each spank hurt so much. He was so strong, and it frightened me to think of how many spanks I had to come. Even more than that, the fact that this was happening in front of some man I'd never met before filled me with shame. Most of all, I was frustrated and angry at how much control I had lost. I was some weak little creature entirely at the whim of this strong, brutal man who seemed completely in control of himself. I cried, I shouted, I kicked my legs, and I counted every single stroke I got and thanked him for the privilege. When he finished with me, he gently lifted me off of him so I was standing. My butt was sore and throbbing. I sniffed as tears fell down my face. I refused to look up at the stranger, but I could feel him staring at me. He hadn't seen how powerful and cool I looked as I watched the buildings burn down. He just saw this sobbing, fragile mess.<br><br>″Do you understand why I did that, Lara?″<br><br>I cried again.<br><br>″Lara?″ he repeated.<br><br>″Y-y-yes.″<br><br>″Why did I do that?″<br><br>″Because I didn't come around like you asked.″ My voice was quiet.<br><br>″What will you do next time?″<br><br>″What you tell me.″<br><br>″Thank you.″ He looked up at the stranger. ″That's pretty much what a lot of the job is like. Breaking the bounty until they comply.″<br><br>″Yes, I see. It's very interesting.″<br><br>They chatted a few more minutes. I looked down and away. The shame was still there, and I sat with it quietly. I knew the stranger was staring at my body and especially my tits, but I didn't move or say anything because I didn't want to get spanked again. After a while, my captor and his new friend said their goodbyes, and we started moving again.<br><br>Night started to fall. My captor stopped us. He tied me to the horse, then pulled another rope out of his pack. He threw it over a tree branch a few times, tied a strange knot, then pulled me over to it. He untied my from my bounds, then tied one end of the rope to one of my wrists and one end to the other. My hands were held above my head. I admit, after having my hands tied behind my back for half the day, it felt good to stretch them out. I stood by the tree and watched him collect firewood, make a campfire, and roll out his sleeping pack. He pulled out the cream and applied it again, and I looked away from him as he did it.<br><br>He then pulled out a jar of some strange dark purple jelly and a spoon. He scooped it up with the spoon and pushed it towards my mouth.<br><br>″What is that?″<br><br>″It's food. It tastes good and it's good for you. Do you really want to argue with me?″<br><br>I looked at him suspiciously. Then I opened my mouth.″<br><br>″Very good.″ He put the spoon in my mouth. He was right, it was delicious. It was more filling than I expected. I felt helpless letting someone feed me, but I did feel a little better with food in me. He fed me a quarter of the jar before putting it away. He then adjusted the rope holding my hands up. He laid out a sleeping pack for me. ″You'll be sleeping tied to this tree.″<br><br>That night, I had a strange dream. I was naked and riding on top of the magical train of Capital City.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 3", content: "<p>When I woke up the next morning, my captor was already awake. When he saw I was up, he came over and beckoned me to stand up. He adjusted the rope that he had tied me to the tree with so that my arms were raised above my head again. He then pulled out his jar of jelly and proceeded to feed me. I knew he could have left my arms slack so that I could simply feed myself, but I assume he had intended to humiliate me by making me feel helpless. He succeeded. I opened my mouth to allow him to shove the spoonful of jelly in. As delicious as it was, I felt deep shame.<br><br>That shame came from recognising that I was a coward. I could have said I was simply hungry, but in truth I was terrified of getting spanked again for disobedience. The pain in my butt from the spanking yesterday had faded away, but the memory was seared into my mind. I had given up control to my captor. I had acted like a weak, emotional little creature and been treated like one. I had thrown a temper tantrum and still submitted to my captor, thanking him for each painful blow to my ass.<br><br>When he finished feeding me, he looked at me expectantly. I said nothing.<br><br>″What do you say when someone feeds you?″<br><br>″Thank you,″ I said quietly.<br><br>He smiled earnestly. ″What do you say when I feed you?″<br><br>I was confused, then it hit me. ″Thank you, sir.″<br><br>He nodded, then started applying the protective cream to me. I would say what he wanted me to say, even if I didn't mean it. I would get through this with as little pain as possible. I allowed him to massage the cream into my breasts and back and legs and genitals and arms, picturing what I would do when I was free again.<br><br>He then untied my rope from the tree. He untied the rope from my wrists, then tied my wrists together. He guided my hands up over my head and behind my neck, looping the rope around my chest under my breasts and tying a knot I couldn't see behind me.<br><br>″Try and lift your hands over your head.″<br><br>I struggled. ″I can't.″<br><br>″Excellent.″ He walked back around and tied another rope to the rope around my belly, then tied that to his horse. ″We begin marching again. We'll be in town soon.″<br><br>My eyes widened. He clicked his tongue and his horse trotted forward, pulling me along. It had been bad enough being naked in front of my captor and unbearably shameful being naked in front of that stranger yesterday. The thought of a whole town of villagers seeing my nude body was too much. I looked up at the back of his head and calculated. What could I do to keep my body from being seen? I could get behind his horse, of course, but that had lasted exactly as long as it took for him to get off his horse, and it was part of the chain of events that lead to getting... that I wanted to avoid. Especially so publicly.<br><br>This was when dread began to set in. I started pulling on my binds to no avail. I was in a hopeless situation! We came out of the forest onto a road, and I saw the town ahead of us. My feet felt like lead and my legs felt like jelly, and yet I kept soldiering on. My captor and his horse were moving endlessly forward, pulling me along with them. He was an implacable creature gently but forcefully leading me to my ultimate humiliation.<br><br>″Lara,″ said my captor, ″You may look the villagers in the eye if you want to. You can also choose to look away so you don't have to take in the shame. It's up to you.″<br><br>The bastard. I saw what he was doing. He was taking away the choice by drawing attention to its existence. I look them in the eye, I have to take in their judgement. I look away, and we all know I'm admitting to weakness. Either way, I'm doing what he allows. Any chance he has to drive in the helplessness, he takes it.<br><br>As we walked into town, I saw the villagers staring, shocked and open-mouthed. My face burned with shame. My eyes ended up cast down - gods, this whole experience was teaching me how weak I am - but I could hear them talking to each other. Some of them were talking about my breasts. Some of them were describing sexual acts they'd do to me. Some old ladies were talking about me like I was some sexual deviant. None of them saw me the way I liked to see myself. So many eyes leering and leering at my naked body.<br><br>″Excuse me, sir,″ said a watch commander, walking up to my captor. ″What's this? Why have you got this young lass all in the nuddy and tied up?″<br><br>″I'm an ENF hunter. Working in the name of the king. I have my official papers here.″<br><br>″Oh! How remarkable. I knew of your occupation but I've never seen one in person.″ He looked from the papers to me, a stern look on his face. ″What has this young lady done?″<br><br>″Arson,″ said my captor. ″Amongst other things, she burned down the Xarceus library.″<br><br>″Xarceus?!″ cried out a voice in the crowd. People stepped aside as a well-dressed man emerged from the crowd. ″This little shit burned down my library?!″ The well-dressed man stared me down with a look of fury on his face. I shrank back as best I could. I felt small and worthless under his gaze. His deep, rugged voice frightened me. ″I demand you hand her over! She destroyed my livelihood and the livelihood of all my colleagues!″<br><br>″My good sir,″ said my captor, turning his horse to face the well-dressed librarian. ″I can assure you this woman is facing something that will adequately punish her for her actions. What you see before you - a humiliating position for her - is merely the tip of the iceberg.″<br><br>A chill went through my soul. My captor was planning something worse? More humiliating than being paraded nude through the streets of a strange town, my arms tied behind my neck, hearing strangers comment on my body and character?<br><br>″I demand to see it myself.″<br><br>″You are in no position to make demands, sir. I am the one given the privilege and responsibility of discharging her punishment. Anything you see done to her is a result of my kindness.″<br><br>The well-dressed librarian looked frustrated. ″Well then, may I learn of what she will be punished with?″<br><br>″She will be tied up and publicly tickle tortured at 3pm this afternoon.″<br><br>A wave of gasps moved through the crowd. The well-dressed librarian was surprised; he frowned, then his frown turned to delight.<br><br>″Excellent! Excellent. I think I see it. Yes!″<br><br>A lump grew in my throat. Suddenly, my armpits felt very exposed, and I could practically feel the air around them. I am very ticklish and hate to be tickled. I was to descend to a new level of humiliation. The clock was running.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 4", content: "<p>I sat outside the tavern, filled with contempt and ignoring the stares of passersby. My captor had retied my hands behind my back in the more traditional way, then tied me to the horse post outside where he intended to drink for a while. He left me the stool so that I could sit, which I had chosen to do.<br><br>I was filled with dread. I felt as if I had a cold hand clenched around my throat. My captor had declared I would be publicly tickled at 3pm. We had arrived in this village at noon, and after an incident with the locals, he had gone inside the tavern for lunch and left me outside. The locals had been staring at me and making jokes to each other but otherwise keeping their distance.<br><br>It was, of course, utterly humiliating to be tied up outside naked, my hands restrained behind my back so I couldn't cover myself. I had kept my legs crossed, but eventually that got tiring and I just gave up. I felt their eyes lingering on my breasts, my ass, my pussy. I was exposed on a level I have never been. I wanted the ground to swallow me up.<br><br>What terrified me was that my captor had promised worse. Each stage of my journey had sunk me deeper into humiliation. What would come after the tickle torture? What was his ultimate end? I knew he was taking me to my father. What else what I be subject to before we got there?<br><br>A young man came out of the tavern and walked up to me. He was another ignorant villager. He wore simple brown clothes that hugged his lean, muscular form. He had dull cow eyes - dumb muscle.<br><br>″So you burned down a library?″ he asked.<br><br>″Fuck off and annoy someone else,″ I said.<br><br>He turned his head and smiled. ″He told me that if you were rude to me, I was to come get him so he could punish you in the customary manner.″ He turned to head back into the tavern.<br><br>Panic gripped me. ″No, stop!″ He stopped. ″Look, I'm sorry. Please don't tell him I was rude. I'll be nice, I'll be nice.″ As he looked me over, I realised I had stood up. Not only did he have a full frontal view of my naked body, he'd have gotten a good look at how my breasts can jiggle when I move quickly. I averted my gaze.<br><br>″So you burned down a library?″ he asked again.<br><br>″Yeah,″ I mumbled.<br><br>″Why?″<br><br>″I dunno.″<br><br>″Was it because you wanted to get caught and publicly paraded naked?″<br><br>My temper flared. ″No!″<br><br>″That's what people are saying.″<br><br>″Well, it's bullshit. I'd never want this.″<br><br>″So why did you burn it down?″<br><br>″It was just a fucking library! Who cares?″<br><br>″A lot of people use libraries.″<br><br>″So? Nerds, old mages, unimportant people.″<br><br>″Homeless people looking to escape the cold. Children. Communities.″<br><br>″They can live without it. How important can it really be?″<br><br>He looked down at me. I was taken aback by the look of contempt on his face. Finally he spoke: ″I'm going to tell him you were rude to me.″<br><br>″What? No! Please!″ He walked away from me. I stepped forward then felt the tug from the rope and realised I was still tied to the horse post. ″Stop! I'm sorry!″ I cried out as I tugged at the rope, frantically trying to loosen the knot. ″Please don't!″ He simply kept walking. Other villagers were staring at the sight of me panicking and jiggling and moving. I felt the tears fall down my face again. I tried running back to the post and rubbing the ropes against the post trying to break them.<br><br>This was when my captor strolled back out of the tavern. ″Please don't, Sir!″ I sobbed. ″I didn't mean it! I'm sorry!″ He grabbed a chair from the side of the tavern as he walked to me. Behind him was the villager, watching impassively. ″You don't have to do this, Sir!″<br><br>He sat the chair down by the horse post, grabbed my hands, sliced the rope with a knife, sat on the chair, and pulled me over his knee all in a few very quick motions. I was openly wailing by this point. Villagers had all stopped to watch. Some of them were laughing at me. My stomach felt heavy.<br><br>″Lara. You know the rules. Repeat them back to me.″<br><br>I composed myself enough to speak. ″Count every spank. Say 'thank you, Sir'. If I don't do this fast enough, I get two more.″<br><br>″Very good. For being rude, you will have fifteen spanks.″<br><br>″What?! That's not fair! ARRGH! One! Thank you, Sir! Oooooh! Two! Thank you, Sir!″<br><br>As he kept a steady rhythm of spanking so painful I thought I'd never walk again, I looked over and saw the villager watching me. He had a sadistic grin on his face. Almost like I deserved what I was getting. I was so distracted trying to figure out why he'd think this that I missed the count on one of my spanks. I refocused, enduring every painful swat and counting and thanking my captor for every one.<br><br>″Fifteen! Thank you, Sir! Ugh! Sixteen! Thank you, Sir! Arrgh! Seventeen! Thank you, Sir!″<br><br>He lifted me back up off his lap and then frogmarched me to the tavern's porch. He tied a rope back onto one of my wrists, then threw the rope over a beam in the tavern's porch roof, then tied the rope to my other wrist, then threw it over the beam again. He pulled hard, lifting my arms right up. He then took the end of the rope and tied it to the porch side.<br><br>″You've lost your sitting privileges. You'll have to wait here until it's time to tickle you.″ He then walked back into the tavern.<br><br>I stood there morosely. Then the villager walked up from behind me.<br><br>″You deserve this, you know,″ he said poisonously.<br><br>″What?″<br><br>″You do.″<br><br>″No. I don't deserve this. It isn't fair!″<br><br>″It's perfectly fair, and that's what burns you up inside. You're a selfish person, not giving a whit about anything other than your own pleasure and your own sense of power. How many lives have you ruined by destroying so much? Well, now you're the one under the thumb of power. This guy has taken away everything you actually care about - your pride, your dignity, and your ability to control anything you do. If you had any sense, you'd embrace this, let yourself feel shame, and turn over a new leaf. But maybe you're so stupid and callous, you'll learn nothing.″<br><br>I was silent. I was filled with shame. I realised now what a kindness my captor had been doing for me. He had only taken my clothes. This supposed ignorant villager was really the one who had stripped me naked. I started to sob. He looked me over.<br><br>″If I ignore what a terrible person you are, you really are beautiful. Your skin looks so soft. Your features are classically beautiful. Really nice haircut that frames your face. And those tits are gorgeous.″ He looked me in the eye. ″But I wouldn't touch you with a rented dick, you asshole.″ He walked off. I stood there, more ashamed than ever, waiting for my inevitable tickle torture.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 5", content: "<p>I was standing on the porch of the tavern. My hands were held above my head by rope bound to my wrists. Villagers were walking past on the street, turning their heads to look at me. Some of them were laughing, some of them had looks of pity. This is because I was completely naked.<br><br>I was crushed by my humiliation. Not just the humiliation of being naked in public - though the shame of that still pierced me - but the shame of being insulted. A villager had spoken to me, and on the basis of me being 'rude', he had dobbed me into my captor, who subject me to another spanking. Then he had come up to me and barraged me with insults, insisting I deserved everything that was happening to me.<br><br>I felt empty, except for the pain in my butt. Not a hint of pride to hold onto anymore. I stood on that porch, body and soul exposed to the world. I felt like everyone everywhere felt nothing but shame for me. I'd stopped crying hours ago because I'd simply run out of tears. This is who I was now; a vulnerable, naked, stupid, exposed woman. I wished I'd never burned down that fucking library. It was such a stupid, stupid mistake, and I was a stupid, stupid person for doing it.<br><br>My captor came out of the tavern. I looked down, too ashamed to look him in the eyes. He gently grasped my body and turned me to face the street; I did not resist. A crowd had gathered. It was three o'clock; time for my public tickle torture. He turned to me and gently stroked the very tip of his finger down my armpit. I gently gasped as I felt that spark of ticklishness, and despite my emptiness, an involuntary grin came over my face.<br><br>He nodded as if confirming something. Incredibly, I felt even more exposed than before. Actually getting tickled had put the sensation back in the forefront of my brain. I knew when he touched me again, it would tickle even more. I nervously shifted my weight from one foot to another. My breathing became sharper. I could feel the air pass over my armpits.<br><br>He stroked his finger down my other armpit. I screamed and jerked my shoulder. He then grabbed my shoulders and used his thumbs to tickle my armpits. The sensation was unbearable; I laughed long and hard and loud. Some of the villagers started laughing too - not out of being tickled, but because this was the funniest thing they'd seen. They saw the stupid little firebug was being punished and didn't like it, and they found that hilarious.<br><br>Eventually it's like my skin became inured to the feeling of being tickled. My laughter faded. My expression went blank. My captor took note of this and shifted both of his hands down to my belly, gently scratching at me like a spider walking across me, and I started up again. My body shook, but I kept as still as I could, knowing he would hold me steady anyway. I think he noticed this.<br><br>″Do her feet next!″ cried out a voice from the crowd. My captor ignored him. He kept tickling for an excruciating amount of time. I laughed myself horse. Incredibly, more tears came. I was bleary and red-eyed. My body ached from shaking and I stomped the ground like a horse to try and endure the ticklish sensation. With time, the ticklish sensation became less strong. The laughter slowly disappaited.<br><br>″Her feet, man, her feet!″<br><br>My captor turned to him. ″I am not a bard in your tavern. I don't take requests.″ This was the closest I'd heard to him being annoyed. This seemed to shut up the guy in the crowd. My captor then went lower and started tickling behind my knees. I was so shocked - both by the action and by how ticklish it turned out to be - that I shrieked. How long would this be going? How much more was I to endure? I giggled, snorted, cackled. My skin was so sensitive. This truly was torture.<br><br>″Please! Please stop!″ I finally cried out. I couldn't take it any more. I knew he wouldn't stop, but I begged anyway.<br><br>″You want me to stop?″ he asked authoritatively.<br><br>″Yes! YES! PLEASE!″<br><br>″That's too bad.″<br><br>I went limp. I didn't stop laughing, it didn't become any more bearable, but I went limp. He would keep going. He continued for what felt like hours and I took it. Not out of any heroic spirit, not out of willpower, but because I was too tired - physically, emotionally, spiritually - to fight it. Finally, mercifully, he stopped. He let go of me, and as I caught my breath, he untied the end of the rope from where he'd tied it to the porch, then pulled it over.<br><br>″Aw, that's bullshit, man!″ said the voice in the crowd as my captor let me fall to my butt. I sat down, looking at the ground as he pulled his rope down. ″You never tickled her feet!″ The crowd murmered and started dispersing, realising the show was over as my captor retied my wrists together in front of me and then tied the rope up around my throat and around my belly - as much to use up the rope as anything, I assumed.<br><br>He then pulled me along to where his horse was tied up, climbed up on his horse, and kicked his heels against the horse. I was a well-trained as his horse at this point and began moving with them both. We walked out of the village. I took one last look back and saw that villager who talked to me, leaning against a post a smirking. I felt a dagger through my heart and quickly looked back down.<br><br>We walked for about half an hour in silence. I was the shameful, stupid little asshole he was dragging around, buck naked and deserving everything that was happening to her. I felt like the worst person in the world. It was then that he said this: ″You were a good girl, taking your punishment like that.″<br><br>I looked up in shock. He hadn't turned his head.<br><br>″I saw you that you weren't fighting me when I tickled you. That's good. You weren't fighting your punishment. I'll rub down your butt with the protector cream tonight.″<br><br>I was shocked. But it felt good. After the awful things that villager told me, it was nice to hear some kind of words of praise. I cheered up.<br><br>When nightfall came, we went through our nightly routine. He rubbed me down with the cream, including my butt. That was my reward for being a good girl. The pain from my spanking faded fast. It felt nice. He fed me the jelly, then set up my bed for the night. I laid down to sleep.<br><br>It felt almost instantly that he shook me awake. I started to mutter in confusion.<br><br>″Quiet Lara.″<br><br>″Huh?″<br><br>″We're about to be attacked. There are men out in the woods.″</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 6", content: "<p>There were men around our campsite.<br><br>My heart was pounding. I was awake instantly. My captor put his hand over my mouth before I could move.<br><br>″Hush,″ he said gently. ″What I'm about to do to you is not punishment, it's to protect you.″ He muttered something and waved his hands over me. Purple sparks of light that looked like stars emerged from his hands, and they lifted me into the air while keeping the ropes binding my wrists taut. I ended up high up in the tree with my body posed like a 'T'. The purple stars holding me up were warm and gentle. It was like being displayed on a pile of cushions.<br><br>Five men emerged from the darkness.<br><br>″That's a nice trick, man,″ said the leader, brandishing a club. ″Bring her down so we can finally see her feet tickled. Then we'll have some real fun with her.″<br><br>″That's not part of her punishment, and even if it were, you're not delivering her punishment,″ said my captor.<br><br>″It is now.″ The man pointed at me. ″Bring her down now or we'll have to get--″<br><br>″Arko!″ cried out my captor. A beam of purple light emerged from his outstretched hand and knocked the leader to the ground. Startled, the group broke ranks; one of them ran away into the distance, one of them was too surprised to move, and the rest caught themselves and ran directly at my captor.<br><br>One of them swung a fist at him, and he waved his hand; the bad guy's fist bounced off a purple haze and he cried out in pain. My captor then raised his hands and muttered something. Black tendrils emerged from the ground and started grabbing them.<br><br>″What the fuck - hey, stop tearing off my clothes!″<br><br>Indeed, once the tendrils had seized a man by the wrists and feet, other tendrils stated ripping their clothes off. Their bodies were beautiful - muscular and wiry from working in the sun all day. They blushed as the tendrils held their arms behind their backs and exposed their cocks to the night air.<br><br>The leader of them - he who had been lusting after my feet - was running away, leaving his friends to take all the punishment like a coward. My captor waved his hands and a giant transparent purple woman rose from the ground in front of him. She wore a cleric's outfit and had a stern expression. The wannabe-tickler froze in fear.<br><br>″Ms Haberny?″ he cried out.<br><br>The illusory Ms Haberny made a tut-tut-tut sound. ″NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY,″ she said in a booming voice. ″NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY NEEDS TO BE PUNISHED.″ She grabbed him, dragged his clothes off, pulled a purple, transparent stick out of nowhere, and started lashing him over the behind with it. He cried out in pain and humiliation.<br><br>I watched as a range of emotions competed for my attention. I was overjoyed to see someone else get the naked-in-public treatment for a change, especially these assholes. I was surprised to find myself turned on by their humiliation and public exposure. Like, I said, their bodies were beautiful; bronzed and tough, with soft and gorgeous cocks that I wanted to kiss. Seeing their embarrassed expressions and struggling against the tendrils desperately trying to cover up... it made me want to touch myself.<br><br>Most of all, what I felt was awe at my captor's power. In retrospect, my arguments and threats and struggles were like a spider in a glass jar, unaware of the power it was fighting. As he got his tendrils to tickle the feet of the men and elicite gales of laughter from them, it truly dawned on me how much restraint my captor had shown me. He could have laid this power on me from the start; he could have used it on me when I acted up. I suppose I would have deserved it, too. But he'd done no more than necessary to keep me moving.<br><br>He tied the men together with rope. The leader and one other random guy were tied together in a humiliating pose, face to face with their arms around each other like lovers in an embrace. The others he tied up with knots I recognised from when he tied me up. From the outside, the one in which the wrists are bound behind the neck and exposing the armpits was beautiful.<br><br>″Now go home.″<br><br>Filled with shame, the men marched back in the direction of the town. I imagined the looks on people's faces as they marched in, unable to cover up their dicks. I imagined the shame they'd feel, completely exposed to the world. I was so horny I couldn't think straight.<br><br>My captor looked up at me. He held out his hand and I was gently lowered back down to the ground.<br><br>″Are you alright?″ he asked.<br><br>I looked up at him. He was taller than me. I saw him properly for the first time - a creature of such incredible power, but also incredible discipline. He would never do anything to me I didn't deserve because he had never done anything to me I hadn't deserved. I could trust him completely to follow his word. I could trust everything he did, even if I didn't understand it. I was naked and exposed, bringing much shame onto myself, but I was never in danger.<br><br>″Yes, Sir,″ I said. ″I'm fine.″<br><br>Sir nodded. He lowered me back into my bed, putting my blanket back over me.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 7", content: "<p>Sir woke me up the next morning.<br><br>He sat me up so he could feed me, and when he shoved his spoon into his jelly and pointed it at me, I obediently opened my mouth without a word. When he finished, I obediently waited for him to lift me up by the rope attached to my wrists. I obediently stood quiet and still as he rubbed the cream over me - even my butt. As a reward for all this obedience, he patted me on the shoulder and said ‶Good girl.‶<br><br>My face flushed and my heart rose. Submission to someone else's will wasn't so bad. I could feel his strength and how he controlled it as he moved me around now; when he touched me, I felt like an egg being held in an elephant's trunk. I also felt more safe than I ever had in my life. All this power wasn't going to be turned on me - it was to protect me.<br><br>That was how our trip worked for the next few days. Sir lead me naked along the path. Sometimes people would come the other way, and sometimes he'd stop to talk to them and sometimes he wouldn't. Either way, I would feel their eyes all over my body. I was too ashamed to look up at them, but I could feel them soaking up my breasts and butt and pussy. I felt the shame, knowing that it hurt less than Sir's hand on my ass. I could practically feel the shame on my very skin. We would stop to rest and make camp, and the routine became normal; I almost looked forward to the delicious jelly and to getting the warm, comforting gel.<br><br>When we were deep in the woods, we came to a large house that looked like a tavern with a large set of back rooms. Sir stopped his horse and hitched it to the front post, then lead me inside. It was a beehive of activity; there was a woman in neat formal robes sitting at a desk in the front, and to my left was a large open room with many similarly-dressed people at many desks. It was a flurry of activity as people got up and walked around and passed papers to each other.<br><br>The woman looked up at us. Her hair was in a bun and she wore horn-rimmed glasses, and she had a severe look on her face. I felt very underdressed.<br><br>‶Hello. Here is my identification,‶ said Sir. ‶Lara here doesn't know my name, and I'd like to keep it that way.‶<br><br>‶Understood,‶ said the woman. She pulled out a collar with a pink label attached to it and scrawled 'A27' on it. As she wrote, a man in formal robes walked past us. The formality of the place left me feeling even more naked and weak. This was a place that projected authority and power, and I was projecting vulnerability. She handed the collar to Sir and he put it around my neck.<br><br>‶Take Lara down the corridor to your right. The ENF stable is the door at the very end. You can't miss it.‶<br><br>‶Very good,‶ said Sir. He pulled my rope and I dutifully followed. We entered a corridor with doors everywhere; as instructed, he entered the door at the end of the corridor marked 'ENF STABLE'. Past that door was a small empty room with two double doors in it. I was very confused, and even moreso when Sir turned me around and undid the ropes binding my arms behind my back.<br><br>‶Go through this door. You will be spending the night here.‶<br><br>I stretched my muscles automatically before realising I was pushing my boobs out into the air ridiculously; even freed, I was humiliating myself. But Sir simply walked back through the door he came. I tentatively pushed open the double doors and was shocked at what I saw.<br><br>It actually did look like a barn. It was a big room broken up into sections via wooden support beams; there was a main 'corridor' and many little cubicles on each side, though the cubicles had no privacy - only large wooden slats separating them. Each cubicle had a layer of straw, a mattress, and a small table with a jug of water. That is to say, it was a stable in which I was a horse.<br><br>What really grabbed my attention was the three naked women standing in the 'corridor'. They looked like they had been talking and I'd interrupted them.<br><br>‶Hello!‶ said one, who started walking towards me. She was about my height, with curly and bright red hair that fell to her shoulders. Her nude body was pale, not just from lack of sunlight - her arms and face were freckled - but because she was simply a pale person. Her breasts were perky and she looked like she spent a lot of time indoors. When she noticed me looking at her body, her face pinkened and she nervously rubbed her shoulder, not quite covering her body.<br><br>‶Haha yeah,‶ she said, grinning through her embarrassment. There was a sparkle in her big green eyes like she was seeing something I couldn't. ‶My name is Penny. Over there is Saffron - she's the tall one - and Delilah.‶<br><br>Saffron was indeed very tall - when she stood up from the haycube she was sitting on, she was over six feet. She was very thin and had a very flat chest. Her hair was jet-black and short - not even falling past her ears - but very thick and messy. She openly stared at me and then looked down at the ground in shyness. Delilah was short and pear-shaped, with very wide hips and long, blonde hair that went all the way down to her ass. She had her hands on her hips and a sour look on her face. All three women wore collars around their necks like the one around mine.<br><br>‶I'm Lara,‶ I said. Penny took my hand and pulled me over to the others; the sudden act of intimacy caught me off-guard, but after the week I'd had, I have to admit it felt good. Her hands were very soft.<br><br>‶So,‶ said Penny. ‶What did you get caught for?‶<br><br>‶Pardon?‶<br><br>‶You're an ENF. You've done something wrong, and they sent a catcher to find you, strip you naked, tie you up, and march you to whoever you wronged. I committed fraud, for example.‶ She blushed as she brought up the memory. ‶I was working in a grainery as an accountant. I figured out how to cook the books so that I could slip myself a few dollars here and there - nothing I thought anyone would notice. Then Sir shows up. He's knows who I am, what I've done, and--‶ she bit her lip, ‶and he makes me strip naked in front of all my coworkers, and he ties my hands behind my back so I can't cover myself, and he marches me out into the street.‶<br><br>She covered her face with her hands.<br><br>‶Are you okay?‶ I asked.<br><br>‶She's a pervert,‶ said Delilah irritably. ‶She's been getting off on being paraded around naked like this.‶<br><br>‶God, she's right!‶ said Penny. She lowered her hands and revealed a huge grin on her face. ‶All those people leering and leering at my naked, exposed body...‶ Her attention wavered. I noticed her nipples were at attention. ‶Just like you're looking at my body right now!‶ she giggled. I looked away in embarrassment and she giggled until she snorted.<br><br>‶Perverts!‶ said Delilah, putting her hands on her hips and frowning. ‶We've been kidnapped and publicly humiliated and you're all getting off on it?‶ In her anger, she seemed to try and make herself taller, which made her large breasts stand out. When she saw me looking at them, she blushed, shrank back down, and covered them with her arm while covering her crotch with her other hand.<br><br>It was then that I clicked on that Saffron was looking at my body, and indeed had been the entire time. We were four naked women, all staring at each other. I nervously rubbed my shoulder.<br><br>‶This one is the biggest pervert of all!‶ said Delilah. ‶She's a lesbian! She's getting off to all of us!‶<br><br>‶Sorry,‶ said Saffron quietly, looking away. Despite her height she seemed to try and shrink herself down. It was almost cute. ‶I worked at an ENF stable. They caught me sneaking into the barn to spy on the women. I suppose I deserve this.‶ She chanced looking back up at me. ‶I'm not as beautiful as the rest of you.‶<br><br>‶You have your charms, girl,‶ came a strange, melodic voice. I turned my head, trying to figure out who that was. Then a woman emerged from a section deeper in the barn and I gasped.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 8", content: "<p>She was an elf, she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen, and she was completely nude.<br><br>Her skin was baby blue, and she had dark blue spots running up the left side of her body like a leopard. She had sheer white hair that fell past her shoulders; her long elven ears poked through, framing her face elegantly. She also had a patch of soft, white pubic hair. Her hips swayed as she walked and her breasts looked soft to the touch.<br><br>She had an ethereal air to her. Her face was thin and angular, but her expression was soft and sad; her eyes - purple with white stars in the pupils - seemed so haunted, and her thin lips were caught in a half-smile. She walked with a smooth elegance that both belied and highlighted the fact that she was buck-ass naked.<br><br>‶Ah, you're choosing to join us, Lyarra?‶ said Penny, micheviously grinning and twirling her curly red hair with her finger.<br><br>Lyarra the elf didn't look away from me as she responded. ‶I was curious about our new addition. You've all said how you feel about what's happened to us. Penny has discovered her exhibitionism.‶ Penny giggled nervously at that. ‶Delilah is humiliated and angry. Saffron is enjoying looking at naked women. What about you?‶<br><br>‶I'm... humiliated...‶<br><br>‶Speak up, girl,‶ said Lyarra sharply.<br><br>‶I'm humiliated! But I also... also...‶ I was struggling to find the words to express myself. She was so beautiful and naked, but she also had this intimidating air of authority. Her expression was unyielding. ‶I also think I deserve this.‶<br><br>‶You think you deserve this?‶<br><br>‶Yes,‶ I said quietly.<br><br>‶You deserve to be stripped naked, tied up, paraded around in public, and spanked?‶<br><br>‶Yes.‶<br><br>She smiled serenely and nodded. ‶You've learned to submit. How beautiful.‶ She circled around me, looking up and down my body as she spoke. ‶I too know this feeling. I am a thief who robs for pleasure as well as profit. It's a whole lifestyle. Part of that lifestyle is that, from time to time, I will be caught. You do it as often as I do, it'll happen from time to time - one wrong move, one moment too slow. Nobody can be perfect. Which means I've been through this before - stripped, tied up, walked through the streets and publicly humiliated. Fighting is pointless and whiny. I accept the shame as part of the decisions I make.‶<br><br>‶You feel shame?‶ I asked. ‶You don't seem it. You're not trying to cover up. You carry yourself so confidently.‶<br><br>‶I wear the shame,‶ she said, looking down at her breasts and delicately running her finger along them. ‶It permeates my whole body.‶<br><br>I could almost see it now she pointed it out. She was accepting that we were looking at her most intimate areas and feeling the ache of humiliation. She was truly naked before us. She stopped in front of me, uncomfortably close, her sweet-smelling breath on my face, but I dared not move.<br><br>‶Submission is wonderful in its own way. Completely vulnerable and yet completely safe. Like a glass statue. Fragile, on display, dependent on your caretaker. You feel beautiful and delicate.‶<br><br>I knew she was right. She had been saying what I was thinking for days, and her ethereal and delicate voice conveyed her awe at getting to submit and how beautiful she found it. Like her, I'm beautiful and delicate and ethereal; shameful and weak and vulnerable too, but that's not so bad.<br><br>‶There are other upsides to being an ENF, of course,‶ she said, cupping my face in her hand and kissing me. I pulled back in shock. Her lips were sweet and soft. She looked down at me kindly. I was naked, exposed, vulnerable, and I had been for over a week at this point. She was naked, exposed, vulnerable. We were being watched by other naked, exposed, vulnerable women. Penny was biting her lower lip, grinning wildly, and twirling her red hair in her fingers. Saffron was covering her face with her hands, except for her eyes. Delilah was watching us intently, still covering her breasts and pussy with her hands.<br><br>I have to admit, I felt pretty good. I kissed Lyarra back. She put her hands on my ass and felt me up as she peppered me with kisses. She kissed my neck and her nose pleasantly tickled me, and then she pulled me over and pushed me onto a bed. As she kissed my face, she slid her fingers into me and I groaned. Her fingers were as gentle but firm as her voice; I felt waves of pleasure pulsing through my body, and I begged Lyarra to go faster but she remained steady in her pace.<br><br>‶Ugh! UGH! FUCK YOU, Lyarra! Fuck you, go faster, you bitch!‶<br><br>She smiled serenely. ‶If you're going to be rude...‶ She slowed down.<br><br>‶No! No, I'm sorry. I'll be good. I'll be a good girl.‶<br><br>‶That's better,‶ and she ramped right up, catching me completely off-guard. My body shook as I came again and again.<br><br>‶Oh my gods, I can't just stand back and watch anymore!‶ cried out Saffron, louder than I had ever heard her. She pushed Lyarra aside and kissed my face, then kissed my neck, then kissed my breast, then kissed my belly, and finally kissed my pussy. Then she greedily licked and sucked and kissed, going absolutely to town on my genitals. I felt like a majestic deer being devoured by a wolf. I felt wave after wave of pleasure through my body.<br><br>Lyarra climbed onto bed next to me and kissed my neck and cheek as she teased my breasts. I giggled at how ticklish it was. Her body was so warm and comfortable and her touch was light. Then Penny climbed on my other side. I looked at her in surprise as she started kissing my breasts and she smirked.<br><br>‶I'm not normally into women, but this was so fucking hot.‶ She then ran her tongue over my nipple.<br><br>‶Aw, to hell with it!‶ said Delilah. ‶I'm not missing out.‶ She climbed over me as well and kissed my belly, the only free space left.<br><br>I was in heaven. It felt like every part of my body was being assaulted with pleasure. Saffron was a licking and sucking powerhouse. I was the centre of the universe, beloved by all. In this I had a moment of clarity. I cried for them all to stop, pushing Saffron's head off me.<br><br>‶What's wrong?‶ asked Penny.<br><br>I grinned. ‶It's your turn.‶ I dragged her onto the bed in my place and kissed her face, telling her how beautiful she was. Saffron followed my lead, kissing and licking her pussy, causing Penny to gasp and moan. She was delighted - getting to be the centre of the room, to be our whole universe, her shock of curly red hair bouncing beautifully.<br><br>We worked our way through the others. Lyarra was beautiful and soft to the touch, and there was something deeply arousing at seeing her quiet dignity fall away as she was shocked by Saffron's tongue and by my discovery that her pointy ears were an erogenous zone. Delilah seemed to put herself through the experience more out of fear of missing out than anything; her chubby body was like a big warm pillow. Finally, we all turned on Saffron. We told her she was beautiful and we kept telling her until she believed us.<br><br>‶You're beautiful, Saffron.‶<br><br>‶No, I'm not!‶<br><br>‶You're beautiful.‶ We kissed her breasts, her belly, her feet.<br><br>‶No, I'm goofy and tall.‶<br><br>‶You're beautiful.‶<br><br>‶I'm beautiful.‶<br><br>‶You're beautiful.‶<br><br>‶I'm beautiful.‶<br><br>Seeing her start to believe it due to our sustained efforts turned me on. We all collapsed into a pile of bodies on the bed and fell asleep.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 9", content: "<p>I woke up under a pile of bodies. Saffron was cuddled up to my right. Lyarra was cuddled up to my left. Penny was cuddling behind Lyarra. Delilah was splayed over the top of us all. It was warm and safe and comfortable. I couldn't tell where I ended and the others began, as if our circulatory systems were all connected. Their breathing was slow, their heartbeats pulsing. Just a pile of naked women.<br><br>Lyarra opened her eyes. She looked at me and smiled, then leaned in and kissed me. She had a hand on my breast and lightly traced her finger around my nipple. It was the most agonising pleasure I ever felt; I was being teased and tickled, but I wanted to get off then I would have to wake up the others and lose this comfortable position. I don't know how long we simply laid there looking into each other's eyes before we heard the door open.<br><br>‶Shit,‶ cursed Lyarra quietly, and she practically leapt out of bed. The others groaned as they woke up.<br><br>‶Who's done... what?‶ muttered Delilah.<br><br>‶Lyarra? Where are you?‶ called out a male voice.<br><br>‶I'm here, Sir!‶ Lyarra sounded panicked. I climbed out of bed to see what was happening. There was a man dressed much like my Sir standing at the door. Lyarra was standing far from him and holding her hands in front of herself as if trying to keep him calm; he was rock steady.<br><br>She spoke very quickly: ‶Listen Sir, I'm sorry, I know you said not to have sex in the stable this time but I couldn't help myself--‶<br><br>‶Lyarra,‶ said Sir, walking directly to her, ‶I specifically told you.‶<br><br>‶Yes, I know, Sir, but if you'll hear me out--‶ Lyarra's voice got faster and more shrill, her cool elven calm crumbling before us.<br><br>‶I warned you what would happen, didn't I?‶ he asked, grabbing her by the wrist and dragging her.<br><br>‶No! No, please, Sir!‶ Lyarra shrieked as tears began falling down her face. He pulled her over to a chair and sat, pulling her over his knee.<br><br>‶I'm going to give you ten spanks, Lyarra. I want you to count each one and thank me for it. If you're not fast enough, you'll recieve two more.‶<br><br>‶Please, sir, no! Plea - ARGH! One, thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>The slap was so loud and sharp that I instinctively grabbed my own butt.<br><br>‶Ohhhh! Two! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>Lyarra crumpled like a wet paper bag. The dignified manner she carried herself with had fallen away entirely. She was hysterical, crying, furious. Was she lying to us before and I had fallen for it? Or was this all part of the game for her? Did she enjoy destroying her dignity in front of Sir?<br><br>What I did know was that what I was looking at was beautiful. Seeing her shift from divine and powerful to weak and humiliated awoke something in me. I knew exactly what Lyarra was feeling because I had felt it all myself. Seeing it from the outside put it all in perspective.<br><br>‶Aw! Five! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>She was slumped over his knee, no longer struggling. She'd finally realised there was no fighting this, and as she said, it was beautiful. She was taking her punishment. This was how I had looked.<br><br>‶Ahhahahaha! Ten! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>The Sir pulled her off his knee. She stood up, her butt dark blue from where he had swatted her. He pulled some rope out of his bag and began tying her arms behind her back. I couldn't help but notice he only did a simple knot as opposed to the elaborate ropework my Sir did.<br><br>Lyarra was staring at the floor. I had a naughty idea.<br><br>I got up, ran over to her, and kissed her.<br><br>She looked at me in surprise. Her Sir jerked her back out of my space.<br><br>‶We're going now, Lyarra, so I don't have time to spank you again. But you'll get another ten for that.‶<br><br>As he dragged her out of the room, she looked back at me in shock and horror and humiliation. Penny walked up behind me, giggling.<br><br>‶Oh my god, girl!‶ She hugged me from behind and started kissing my neck.<br><br>The rest of us didn't end up having sex again, though we did cuddle together and kiss. Our bodies were so warm and comfortable and soft. I would draw tiny circles on Penny's breast for a while, then decide to kiss her, then decide to turn and kiss Saffron. We stayed in this fashion until the doors swung open again.<br><br>‶Penny?‶<br><br>The redhead slipped out of bed and skipped towards her Sir, letting her breasts bounce in her joy. He turned her around and tied her up, and she flashed me a massive grin. She was going to enjoy showing off her body. He dragged her out.<br><br>It wasn't long before I heard a familiar voice.<br><br>‶Lara?‶<br><br>‶I'm here, Sir.‶<br><br>I didn't skip to him, but I did walk over and turn around. He put each of my hands over my opposite elbow and tied my arms together to hold them like that. Strange to say, but it made me feel normal. As he led me out, I looked over to Sapphire and Delilah. Sapphire nodded to me. I nodded to her. We were both ENFs.<br><br>Sir walked me through the corridor and back to the front desk. If anything, it was even busier - dozens of people bustled past us in fancy robes, some of them pushing past me. In the stables I had felt - well, still naked, but among equals. Here, I felt very naked and vulnerable again. I was the inferior, the submissive, the bottom of the pecking order.<br><br>And you know, I'm learning to be okay with that. As Sir worked with the receptionist, signing things she told him to sign and talking to her, I stood there in full view of all. I had seen how pathetic fighting one's status looks; being paraded around nude was humiliating, but I had brought it upon myself by lighting those fires.<br><br>Sir finished up his paperwork and led me out. I followed. He would fill his role - I knew his discipline would not falter once - and I would fill mine. If he told me to walk, I would walk. If he told me to stay, I would stay. If he thought I deserved a spanking, I would take my spanks and thank him for every single one.<br><br>I was ready to submit.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 10",content: "<p>‶Good lord, that woman is naked!‶<br><br>‶Oh yes. She's an ENF. She's committed a crime, and she's been stripped naked so she can be lead back to her victims and made to apologise.‶<br><br>I didn't turn my head to look at who was talking, but I did feel my face burning. I was tied up outside another bar; we had come to yet another village, this one much larger than any other we had passed through. I had accepted the situation and accepted the humiliation. People pointed and stared; some made embarrassing jokes. Most people seemed to know what I was, though - Sir must have passed through here before.<br><br>This time Sir had tied a rope around my neck and then tied it to a support beam of the bar's porch. My wrists were tied behind my back so that my right elbow was pointing up and my left elbow was pointing down. After being tickled last week, my armpit was very sensitive to exposure, but he never touched me. I had enough give from the rope to sit or stand as I pleased. I was currently choosing to stand.<br><br>Sir came out of the bar with a tall, muscular man with a big black beard and made a beeline for me.<br><br>‶Lara. I'm going with Damien here. I'll be right back with the next part of your punishment. Understand?‶<br><br>‶Yes, Sir,‶ I said softly. My voice had gotten so soft since all this started.<br><br>‶What am I bringing back?‶<br><br>‶The next part of my punishment.‶<br><br>‶Very good.‶ He leaned in, making his voice even gentler. ‶If you try to escape while I'm gone, I'll give you twenty-five spanks.‶<br><br>My eyes widened. This was more than I had ever taken. ‶Yes, Sir. I'll be good.‶<br><br>‶I'm sure you will.‶ He walked off, following Damian.<br><br>As I wondered what Penny would think of being in this position - I eventually decided she would be annoyed at having to work to show off her body, rather than having her hands forcibly held above her head - a young woman walked up to me. She had dark brown skin and jet black hair, and her typical beige villager's clothes fit very snugly on her small breasts and wide ass.<br><br>I admit that the orgy at the stables may have left me a bit horny.<br><br>‶Excuse me,‶ she said. ‶Why are you naked?‶<br><br>I kept my eyes downcast. I wasn't sure if Sir would punish me for talking, or maybe punish me for not talking. ‶I've been a bad girl. I'm being punished.‶<br><br>‶Do you want to be naked and tied up?‶<br><br>‶I deserve to be.‶<br><br>‶Isn't it humiliating?‶<br><br>‶Yes. That's the point.‶<br><br>She frowned thoughtfully, then looked down at my body. I shifted weight from one foot to another, but I didn't sit down or try to hide. I couldn't reach Penny, enjoying having her body on display, but I allowed her to look without fighting.<br><br>‶Your body is pretty. You must be dumb to have let this happen.‶ She walked back to her friends, who immediately started whispering to her. They looked back at me.<br><br>Time passed. I saw Sir and Damien come back down the street; they were on a cart being pulled by a mule. There was also a big, strange-looking wooden chair on the cart. Sir and Damien climbed over and carried it off onto the street. It had a long seat that ended in a set of stocks. Curiously, the stocks had a big shield attached to the top, which itself had a thick glass window.<br><br>Sir came over to me, untied me from the beam, and led me over to the chair. He then turned me around and untied my arms.<br><br>‶Sit, Lara.‶<br><br>I obeyed. Sir undid the stocks and I slipped my feet into the holes; he then closed the stocks, trapping me. I could see my feet through the glass. My arms, to my surprise, were not tied down. Then he ran a finger along my foot and I shrieked. I instinctively tried to pull my foot back, but of course it was trapped.<br><br>Sir began tickling my feet in earnest. Giggles bubbled up out of me involuntarily as I felt the light touch of his fingers on my feet. I bent forward and banged my hands against the glass (feeling the varnished wood of the chair against my naked butt), but to no avail. As I desperately rubbed my fingers against the glass, feeling each lightning bolt travelling from Sir's fingers through my feet and up to my mouth where it emerged as another laugh, I realised what it was there for: so I could see how little control I had right now.<br><br>I leaned back, beating my hands against the side of the chair, still laughing madly, tears streaming down my face.<br><br>‶Please! Hahahaha! Please stop! Hahahahaha! Mercy!‶<br><br>‶No!‶ said Sir, sharper than I'd ever heard from him before. He then dug his fingertips into the joints of my toes. I gasped, not knowing the tickling could feel even stronger. I practically lost control of my body as my knees jerked against the stocks and arms flapped about.<br><br>‶I'm sorry! Hahahahaha! I'm so sorry! Hahahahaha! I wish I'd never burned down that library down!‶<br><br>Sir suddenly stopped. I caught my breath. My face felt hot. I looked up at him, and he was staring at me impassively. I realised how many people had been watching me, seeing my body move and shake (especially my boobs). Some of them were laughing at me. Sir's expression was blank.<br><br>He unhooked the stocks and freed my feet. He pulled me up, tied my hands behind my back in a simple knot, walked me back over to the bar, tied me to the support beam, walked back over to the chair, pulled it up onto the cart, and then rode it away.<br><br>I was very confused.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 11",content: "<p>As I stood, tied to the support beam of the bar, I tried to figure out why Sir had stopped tickling me.<br><br>I had apologised and said I wished I had never burned down that library. It was just something I said in the heat of the moment to beg for mercy; I honestly wasn't expecting any kind of reaction, let alone the relaxing of my torture.<br><br>Somehow I felt more shame saying those words than I did being stripped, or paraded around naked, or spanked, or mocked, or tickled. And yet I also felt cleansed. Standing on that porch, naked as the day I was born, hands tied behind my back, in full view of a passing (and occasionally staring) public, my heart felt lighter and my spirit calm. I am naked, I am tied up, I am in full view of the public, I am humiliated, and I brought that on myself.<br><br>I felt the the wind on my breasts, the rope around my wrists, and the eyes of passers-by on me, and it felt right. You burn down a library and a guy will come to you, strip you naked, tie you up, and march you across the countryside. If I had not burned down the library, I would be wearing however much or little clothing I liked with unbound hands. I was cruel to the world, so the world was cruel to me.<br><br>My thoughts were interrupted by the young woman from before walking up to me. She was scowling.<br><br>‶That was awful, the way he treated you.‶<br><br>‶I deserved it,‶ I said. ‶Like you said, I was dumb enough to get caught.‶<br><br>‶No. Nobody deserved to get tickled until they cry like that. I don't care what you did.‶<br><br>‶That's an interesting perspective.‶<br><br>‶I'm gonna help you here,‶ she said, walking over to my back and pulling a knife out.<br><br>‶No. Don't. That's not gonna end well for either of us.‶<br><br>‶What?‶ she said, slicing my ropes and unbinding my wrists. I kept them clasped together, just in case. ‶Come on. We can get out of here by the time he gets back.‶<br><br>‶No, we can't. Look, you've already doomed yourself, but I can save myself from further punishment.‶ I surprised myself with the casual way I spoke.<br><br>‶What are you talking about?‶ She tried pulling on my arm to move me. ‶Let's go!‶<br><br>There was a click-clack sound. ‶Stop.‶<br><br>It was Sir. He was behind the woman, pointing a loaded crossbow at her.<br><br>‶Damn it!‶ she said. ‶What the hell is wrong with you, lady?‶<br><br>‶Don't talk to her. She is my prisoner. I'm an ENF catcher operating in the name of the king, you are interfering with my work, and there is a specific punishment for that. Take off your clothes.‶<br><br>A grin came across my face.<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶Take off your clothes.‶<br><br>‶I'm not doing that! Fuck you!‶<br><br>‶I'd do what he says.‶<br><br>‶Be quiet, Lara.‶<br><br>‶Sorry, Sir.‶<br><br>‶You're all crazy!‶<br><br>‶Take off your clothes, or I'll take them off you myself.‶<br><br>‶You try and you'll be cut.‶ She brandished her knife.<br><br>Sir's eyes flickered over to me for half a second. He knew that I knew what was about to happen. He waved one hand, and a tentacle emerged from the roof of the bar porch, grabbing her by the wrist.<br><br>‶What the--‶<br><br>Another wave, and another tentacle emerged, grabbing her other wrist. They tentacles held her arms high above her head.<br><br>‶What's this?! What's this?!‶ she spat. She started kicking her legs, and Sir waved his hand again. Tentacles emerged from the floorboards, grabbing her by the legs. Sir lowered his crossbow entirely, walked up to her, and grabbed the knife out of her hand. ‶Don't you fucking dare! Don't you fucking dare, you asshole!‶<br><br>Sir looked at the knife, balancing it and flipping it in his hands. He then raised it to the woman's shirt and tore into it.<br><br>‶Augh! Stop it! Stop it!‶<br><br>He cut her shirt down the front, revealing her fine breasts. Her face went red and she squealed and wiggled, jiggling them. Sir continued down her pants, tearing them up with the knife.<br><br>‶Oh noooooooooooo!‶<br><br>It was hard to feel too sorry for her. If she hadn't ignored my warnings, she would have avoided this.<br><br>Sir walked over to me. It was then that I realised I had kept my hands behind my back the entire time; I had even held my wrists together.<br><br>‶Good girl, Lara,‶ said Sir. He turned me around and tied my arms together in a kind of reverse-prayer pose. He then led me over to his horse and climbed up.<br><br>‶Hey!‶ cried the naked woman. ‶What about me? You can't just leave me here!‶<br><br>‶Yes I can,‶ said Sir indifferently. ‶Those tentacles will disappate by sundown. I assume by then you'll have learned not to interfere in the work on ENF catchers.‶ He clicked his tongue and his horse started walking, pulling me along. I looked back and saw the crowd starting to build around her. These are people she knew and had to see every day.<br><br>Oh shit. That would be me soon.</p>" },
            { title: "Chapter 12",content: "<p>We travelled for a week and a half. I spent the entire trip being a good girl for Sir. When he fed me, I ate without complaint. When he tied me up to prepare a camp, I stood there without fighting. We passed through a few towns, and when he stopped for a drink, he would tie me up outside and I would stand there, watching the people go by and stare and point and laugh at me. I didn't fight it because I'm a good girl now. I deserve to feel small and naked and humiliated for burning down that library. I deserved to have my hands bound high above my head, stopping me from hiding my breasts and pussy. And because I did what I was told, not once did I get spanked.<br><br>It was when I actually saw my home that I started getting nervous again.<br><br>We were walking through a very familiar forest when the trees suddenly opened up, revealing the massive valley that my home town was in. My blood went cold. Sir and his horse continued on mercilessly, dragging me closer and closer. We climbed down the hill until we came to the farmlands. I saw a figure toiling out in the field. It was Damien, a boy I had grown up with. He had been a fat little boy who I teased in school because I knew he had a crush on me; he'd grown into a muscular and tall farmer. I saw him look up at me and stare.<br><br>The thought of Damien staring at my naked body filled me with shame. I felt goosebumps all along my body - my hips, my shoulders, my ass, my breasts. I saw his face - behind that weathered expression was the little fat boy, realising the cute lord's daughter who called him a fat pig when he asked her for a kiss was now fully nude before him, all her most intimate body parts on display at his leisure, her arms tied back to stop her covering himself. He smiled. My face burned.<br><br>He was only the first. Sir lead me through the farmlands, displaying me to the farmers, many of whom I knew. Every time I thought my humiliation had hit peak, it rose further. I saw a few people running ahead of us, presumably sending messages of my naked punishment. My legs turned to lead, and yet we still pressed forward.<br><br>Before I knew it, I was home. There were people lined up in the streets; friends, enemies, acquaintances, and people who just wanted to gawk at the naked girl. And there was my father, stern and steady. The crowd was laughing and jeering; I felt like I had an ice-cold hand holding my heart. I saw a girl I had pushed in the mud as a kid, smirking at my predicament. I saw a boy I had roasted in math class nodding sagely. I saw a lesbian I had brutally mocked for trying to hold my hand; she was leering at me. And there was my father, stern and steady.<br><br>‶Hello, Lara,‶ he said.<br><br>‶Hello, Daddy.‶ I was so ashamed. I wished the earth would swallow me up.<br><br>‶You've been bad. Burning down a library? You have brought shame on yourself and this family. So much so that being stripped nude and paraded across the world was less shameful.‶<br><br>‶Yes, Daddy.‶ My eyes welled up with tears. I felt raw. The rope felt tight around my arms and wrists. Being dragged like this in front of so many people I knew felt more like punishment than getting tied up and tickled. I would be seeing these people every day, knowing that they had seen me raw and naked and vulnerable and pitiable. How would I ever look them in the eye?<br><br>‶Her punishment is not over, my lord,‶ said Sir.<br><br>‶Oh?‶<br><br>Sir climbed down from his horse and took the stool from his pack. I lowered my head in shame, knowing what was coming.<br><br>‶Lara, come here.‶<br><br>I walked over, which was when I realised he was also holding a small wooden paddle.<br><br>‶Lay across my lap.‶<br><br>I obeyed.<br><br>‶You're going to be spanked by this paddle.‶ He held it in front of my face. ‶I want you to kiss it to signify its authority over you.‶<br><br>The utter humiliation of doing this while naked in front of everyone was compounded by the fact that I did it so quickly. He'd trained me well.<br><br>‶You remember what you're supposed to say?‶<br><br>‶I count the spanks and thank you after each one.‶<br><br>‶Good.‶<br><br>‶ARRGH!‶ The paddle felt sharp. Sir used his full strength and I had to gasp for air. ‶One! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>He hadn't told me how many spanks I was going to get.<br><br>‶Oooooooooh! Two! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I kicked my legs, less because I was resisting and more because it felt like the only way to process the pain and shame.<br><br>‶Mmmmm! Five! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I heard the laughter. Everyone was having a grand old time watching me.<br><br>‶Oh-ho-hoho! Nine! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I burst into tears. The paddle hurt so much.<br><br>‶Aaaaaah! Thirteen! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>The shame compounded. My resolve stiffened. Tears stopped falling down my face. I was going to push through every single spank. I just had to keep going.<br><br>‶Seventeen! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>Just keep going.<br><br>‶Twenty-two! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>Just keep going.<br><br>‶Twenty-five! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>Oh gods! This would never end! I was going to be spanked forever! I started to cry again. I kicked my legs in a full-on tantrum.<br><br>‶Waaaaaa! Twenty-six! Thank you, Sir! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Twenty-seven! Thank you, Sir! I wish I'd never burned that library down! Twenty-eight! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>And still he continued.<br><br>‶Thirty-two! Thank you, Sir! Please, Sir! I'm begging you! Oh! Thirty-three! Thank you, Sir! Please, Sir! Please! PLEASE! I'm a bad girl! I'm a bad, naughty girl!‶<br><br>It was then that he stopped. My ass pulsated. It was red raw. I cried. He then lifted me off his lap and pulled me standing. I was bent down in front of him, sobbing and trying to catch my breath. He silently looked at me, waiting for me to be done. I calmed down, looking up at him.<br><br>‶Lara Aegmon. Your punishment is over.‶ He kissed me on the forehead, turned my body around, cut the ropes binding me, then grabbed my wrists and turned me back to face him. ‶You're not a bad girl now. You're a good girl. But if you're a bad girl again, I'll come back and punish you again. Understand?‶<br><br>‶Yes, Sir.‶<br><br>‶Say it back to me.‶<br><br>‶If I'm a bad girl again, you'll come back and punish me again.‶<br><br>‶Good girl.‶ And with that, he climbed on his horse and rode off, leaving me naked in the streets of my home town.</p>" },
            { title: "Epilogue", content: "<p>I never did see Sir again.<br><br>For the first couple of months, I simply lived in the town. As soon as Sir left, I walked into my home and upstairs to my old room, naked and not covering myself, letting the villagers watch me go. At first I tried to sit down, but my ass was so red raw that I couldn't, so I laid on the floor on my side. And I thought. I was no longer a bad girl. I had been, but now I was not. After a while, I got up and looked at my body in a mirror.<br><br>This naked body had been seen by countless people. It had been spanked. It had been tickled. And now it belonged to me again. I felt cleansed. And sore.<br><br>I got dressed in a simple set of clothes and walked down to the living room. I felt the stares of everyone. They had all seen me naked and they were all undressing me with their eyes.<br><br>They didn't know they were looking at a different woman.<br><br>I went to Daddy and asked him what work I could do. He seemed shocked by the question and gave me some simple tasks. Over the next few months, I took on more complicated tasks until I was a functional member of his organisation. It took a lot of constant work to gain people's trust, but I got there.<br><br>It was in that process that I almost accidentally got a girlfriend. The lesbian I had mocked was actually a courier for Daddy. She ended up seeing me often; it was a shock for both of us when she walked into the office and saw me writing a memo. Days went by; routines were established; we kept seeing each other around the place, interactions turned into conversations, conversations turned into long looks, long looks turned into conversations on life, conversations on life turned into sex in a broom closet.<br><br>We now live together in the upstaurs loft. Sometimes she let me bring in a man to play with.<br><br>One day I started going on courier runs - almost as a holiday. I took a trip to the Northern cities. As I was passing through one of the villages, I went by the local tavern where I saw a naked woman. Her hands were tied together and then tied to a support beam on the tavern's porch. She had a mop of curly red hair and a big smile on her face.<br><br>Yes, it was Penny.<br><br>She looked over at me and her smile got even bigger when she saw me. I smiled back to her. I considered walking over to her and giving her a kiss, but I knew only a bad girl does that. Besides, I didn't have time to get stripped and spanked.<br><br>I had too much work to do.<br><br>----<br><br>Author's Note: I wrote this story because it made me horny. I love ENF stories and I know my tastes with them are very particular. ENF stories about women who discover their exhibitionism are fun, but they're also very easy to find. Conversely, stories about ENFs that linger on their humiliation tend to be too cruel for me to get off on. I wanted a story in which the ENF was humiliated without it ever feeling unfair or without compassion. Pride being broken is much sexier than self-esteem getting broken. Hence: punishment. Hence: Sir, a dom with infinite patience, complete honesty, and a set of clear and consistent rules he never breaks.<br><br>I published this story because I was curious how people would react to it. At the time of publishing, by far and away the most popular chapters were the two in which Lara was tickled, followed by Lara's first spanking (which has sometimes been rated well enough to be Hot, though not at time of writing). By contrast, consistently the lowest rated chapter (currently the only one rated less than 4.17, and I do appreciate the consistent high ratings these chapters get) was the one in which Lara has sex with the other ENFs. I assume that either ENF fans don't generally enjoy sex scenes or I'm simply not very good at writing them.<br><br>(Views curved downward over time and I was neither surprised nor offended by that. TV show ratings drop over seasons for the same reason.)<br><br>I intend to return with another ENF catcher story - one that is not only more creative in its punishments, but which has a new character very different from Lara while keeping many of the pleasures of her arc. Lara was deliberately kept vague - all we know about her appearance is that she has big tits and a classically beautiful face, and all we know about her history is that she is a Lord's daughter who burned a library down. That's enough for a functional ENF story, but I'd like to test the belief that a more specific and detailed character could have a more satisfying and sexy humiliation.<br><br>I also intend to throw in the occasional non-ENF short story as inspiration strikes.</p>" }
