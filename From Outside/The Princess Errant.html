<p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Chapter One: Mirella's Shame</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
All the servants in the castle had learned over the years to avoid the North Tower during certain times. Among those times were when lightening would strike the top of the tower during a thunderstorm; when the lord of the castle would run laughing up the steps with one of his many serving wenches; or when the guards would haul one of the lord's errant daughters up the steps to be locked in the top room.<br>
<br>
Just such an event had happened earlier in the day as Princess Shelley, the youngest of six fair sisters, had been manhandled roughly up the sixty steps to the sparse chamber. Weeping and stumbling over every cobblestone, she was nothing more than a tangle of lengthy pale limbs and long shining fair hair, clad in a thin blue dress. King Grimwald had watched his daughter trip over every second step as he dragged her up the stairs, sometimes by the ear, sometimes by her hair.<br>
<br>
"Stop your whining girl," the King snarled, "or I'll throw you out the window once we get there."<br>
<br>
The chamber at the top of the tower was dark and had no bedding or furniture, just the cold smooth floor. There was only one small window that was big enough to crawl out of, had it not been for the two horizontal bars sunken into it. A cold wind constantly swept into the room and swirled about, chilling all that it touched.<br>
<br>
Shelley lay in the middle of this horrid chamber and shivered, long after her father had tossed her onto the floor and rammed the door shut. Long after his mocking steps had faded away down the tower again. All she could do was shiver in the cold, her filmy dress clutched tight around her slender form. And she wept. <br>
<br>
As her sobbing drifted gently down to the castle below many did their best to just hunch their shoulders and continue about their business. All the servants pitied the poor girl. Gossip being rife through the castle meant that all the cooks, tanners, goodwives, ostlers, porters and serving girls knew why the prettiest of the lord's daughters was being punished. And many of them, the serving girls especially, would also risk imprisonment rather than face a marriage to Duke Edgar.<br>
<br>
"That poor, poor girl," said one goodwife to another over the washing tubs. "She has spirit, but she does herself no favours to defy the king so."<br>
<br>
Princess Shelley was everything that Duke Edgar was looking for in a wife. Youthful, pretty, and growing steadily into womanhood for all that she was only just of marriageable age.<br>
<br>
He valued not her mind, for it was determined and quick-witted. Instead he valued her beauty, in much the same way as he prized the skins and furs of the wild animals he had hunted on his lands. Like the boar and bearskins that litter the floor of the Dukes keep, so would the fair skin and long fair hair of the Princess be spread out over the Duke's wedding bed -- hair that fell down to the Princess’ waist. Hair so fair that it transcended gold to become shimmering silver, the colour of the moonlight.<br>
<br>
And in the same way that the Duke's animals had been won by a large hunting party and many hounds, so too had his new fiancé been won. With money and land as a gift to her father. Never in his life had Edgar gained anything through his own wit and skill. Rather all through his power and wealth.<br>
<br>
One serving girl in particular felt a deep sympathy for the captive princess. Her name was Mirella, and she was Shelley's personal servant.<br>
<br>
When Mirella had first arrived at the castle from her small village she had been somewhat in awe of her new surroundings, and her appearance alone had marked her out as yet another ignorant country girl. She was rosy-cheeked, buxom, but with the most honest brown eyes ever seen. She wore plain country girl’s garb that added to her simple beauty, and her flowing dark brown tresses drew many an appreciative stare from the men in the castle.<br>
<br>
And of course it hadn't taken long for her to get into trouble, which happened to be one of Mirella's natural talents.<br>
<br>
On a day many months before Shelley's imprisonment Duke Edgar and his entourage had arrived, with the plan of seeking one of the King's daughters for his wife. His companions were all men of lesser nobility, not to mention some of dubious lineage. Numbering twelve in all they immediately settled into the castles quarters, pestering the servants with unreasonable demands and trying to impress the King's court with tales of their hunting journeys.<br>
<br>
Many an eye of these young noble louts fell upon the daughters of the King, most of whom had the sense to stay well away from such attention, or to meet their advances with polite, but insistent refusal. One, however, seemed determined to confront them.<br>
<br>
The Duke's party was lodged in a private wing of the King's castle. One night over a feast in their quarters and many a jack of mead, their boisterous behaviour became dangerous.<br>
<br>
Mirella was one of four serving girls charged with keeping the noble party plied with food and drink. As was befitting she wore a tavern wenches garb, blue and white, with a billowing dress that flared out from her well rounded hips.<br>
<br>
Throughout the course of the evening she had been pinched and slapped on her ample rump more times than she cared to remember, so much so that it pained her to sit down to rest. As she would walk among them to offer drink she would get all manner of helpful suggestions.<br>
<br>
"Sit here on my lap girl!" cried one.<br>
<br>
"Nay, 'tis not his lap upon which he wants you to sit."<br>
<br>
Drunken laughter followed and Mirella had started to feel flushed about the face. She was aware that her dress was low in the bodice, and that her charms were almost totally on display. Again someone slapped her on the arse. This time with a force so great that she yelped in pain. More laughter. Only Duke Edgar himself did not join in the banter. He sat brooding at the head of the feasting table, his sharp eyes missing nothing.<br>
<br>
"Methinks the horse is not going to move, slap it again Gregory!"<br>
<br>
Another mighty slap resounded as hand met flesh once more, the serving girls dress doing nothing to protect her. Mirella yelped again, louder than before, and then turned to face her abuser. He had all the fine clothes and arrogant features of the rest of the party.<br>
<br>
"Please, my Lord..." Mirella faltered, the jack of mead trembling in her hands.<br>
<br>
Slap! But this one was not aimed at her rump, rather at her face.<br>
<br>
Mirella staggered back into the chair of another noble, who shouted in anger at the intrusion. Slowly Gregory, the one who had fetched her the buffet across the face, rose to his feet.<br>
<br>
"Never..." He loomed over Mirella as her vision swam about, blurred and confused.<br>
<br>
"Ever..." Gregory was in a rage as he grasped her by the hair and pulled it back, forcing her to look up at him.<br>
<br>
"Speak to me..." The sting from the first slap burnt through Mirella's cheek like acid. Eyes watering she looked up at the furious noble in terror.<br>
<br>
"Again!" Gregory punctuated this last shout with another mighty blow. This time with the back of his closed fist which struck Mirella square across the jaw. She spun to the ground and lay there dazed, face down, the jack of ale flung from her hand and slowly pouring out its contents onto the floor. A renewed chorus of drunken laughter belted around the room.<br>
<br>
"Poor lass cannot hold her drink!"<br>
<br>
"What a waste of good mead. Punish the slut for being so careless!"<br>
<br>
This last suggestion was met with a chorus of approval. The three other serving girls were already draped around the table and its patrons. They exchanged nervous glances with one another.<br>
<br>
Mirella lay on the ground twitching, the spilt mead matting her hair and dress. She was stunned, her head felt as though it was on fire, and she could not see Gregory slowly approaching her from behind. He walked as a panther stalks its prey, and his dagger was drawn, the blade gleaming in the candlelight.<br>
<br>
With a swift motion he knelt over her, Mirella's well curved form swelling beneath him. Quickly he drew his dagger under the lace at the back of her dress and sliced up, severing the string in one swift stroke.<br>
<br>
All the nobles had now repositioned themselves to get a better view, shouting encouragement to Gregory. Methodically he set about denuding the helpless girl.<br>
<br>
Slash!<br>
<br>
He cut through the back of her white flowing under-garb from the waist up. He then he slashed the sleeves to tatters. Mirella's back, shoulders and arms were now exposed.<br>
<br>
Rip!<br>
<br>
Next he slashed down through the many layers, severing her dress and her modesty. A few more well aimed, horrendous sounding cuts later and the servant's dress was in tatters underneath her and spread out over the floor. Her quivering rump and shapely legs displayed in all their simple glory. All she was left wearing were her brown leather shoes. Howls of laughter and approval rose up from the excited group.<br>
<br>
"That's not a wench," shouted one, "that's the back end of a horse!"<br>
<br>
"Prithee you could not tell the difference!"<br>
<br>
Gregory rose and looked down at his handy work. Then he turned to resume his seat. Almost as an afterthought he went back and crouched by Mirella's head. Gripping her hair he pulled her head back once more and said very calmly, "Lie here like this until sun up, she-dog. If you do not then I'll cut every inch of skin off your worthless body. Do you understand?"<br>
<br>
Mirella's head had cleared, but she was still terrified. Whimpering she nodded to him, afraid to speak.<br>
<br>
"Good." Gregory let her hair go, thumping her head back down onto the floor and bloodying her nose. He returned to his seat.<br>
<br>
"My Lord Duke," he called to the head of the table, "what thinkest thou of our latest trophy skin? She did not put up much of a fight but she is large enough to cover most of the floor!"<br>
<br>
At this jest the laughter was deafening. Duke Edgar merely raised his goblet to Gregory and smiled.<br>
<br>
The howls of merriment and sounds of the feast drowned out the pitiful sobs of the helpless serving girl. Her rolls of flesh quivered in her shame and fright. As the night wore on and the nobles began to leave they would exit the room only after trying out their new rug, crushing her legs, back and bottom, squashing her heavy breasts into the cold wet floor as they trampled her.<br>
<br>
It felt an eternity before the room was silent and dark, but still Mirella lay on the floor. Silent but for her soft weeping, as if her tears could wash out the pain and fear she was plagued with. She dared not look around or try to stand in case Gregory was still there, just waiting with his gleaming dagger ready. Cold and bruised as she was she doubted if she had the energy.<br>
<br>
It was like this that Shelley found her in the deserted room lying naked and shivering upon the flagstones.<br>
<br>
Mirella until her dying day would not remember the slight, yet strong hands that helped her to the house of healing. Nor the cool moisture and gentle touch as Shelley bathed away her hurt and numbed her bruises with salve and a soft hand. Nor, blissfully, the sensation in her body that she had. As if she had been run over by the royal coach.<br>
<br>
All she could remember is crying. Crying in her agony, and in her shame. No one had ever seen her grown body naked before. She had never lain with a man and after that night did not feel inclined to in her near future. Her shame lay as a lodestone would around her neck.<br>
<br>
One other memory was hers from that torturous night. Waking in the morning and looking straight into Shelley's bright blue eyes: eyes fraught with question and concern over her. Mirella resolved in that instant to love and serve this gentlest of nobles until the day she died.<br>
<br>
And on the day many months later, as Princess Shelley lay weeping in the North Tower, Mirella made another resolution: to do all in her power to set her mistress free.

<div id="C2" style="padding: 10px;">
<p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Chapter Two: Naked Rescue Attempt</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Shelley lay cold and weeping on the flagstones of the chamber, high atop the tallest spire in her family castle. With only the thinnest of long dresses to keep her warm she was very much at the mercy of the icy wind that swept through the solitary window. Her tears chilled her soft cheeks as they fell, stinging and berating her in her misery.<br>
<br>
She had given up hope very quickly that her father would see reason. She had lost faith that he would dismiss Edgar and his hunting barbarians from the castle and take back his pledge to give her as Edgar's bride. After a while her tears flowed no more as she resolved to at least stop crying. Shelley was proud and obstinate, just as her late mother had been. Crying would do her no good and she needed a clear head to figure a way out of this predicament.<br>
<br>
As she sat there, hugging her knees to her chest and doing her best to keep warm, she was forced to admit the situation was hopeless. Even if she could fit through the bars of the window, which she could most certainly not do, she would then face a descent to the ground from a height taller than the highest church steeple. This task too would be impossible for she had no rope, and the wall outside provided no purchase for her hands.<br>
<br>
Inside the tower, escape back down the stairs was just as unlikely. One guard was posted outside her door at all times, and two more at the circular entrance room far below. King Grimwald had chosen these guards personally, knowing that they were impassive and totally loyal to him.<br>
<br>
But escape she must! For the life of a traveler, poor and homeless, was preferable to the misery that would be wedlock to the Duke. Of that she was most certain. But the princess would need a miracle to escape. Part of her realized this, so she then began to pray.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile her faithful servant Mirella was working feverishly on a plan to rescue her captive mistress. Over the months since her shaming at the hands of Duke Edgar's party, she had learned to keep quiet when working in the castle. Shelley had adopted her as her personal maid, a role that Mirella had come to love. This effectively removed any desire to leave the castle, regardless of Edgar and his fops.<br>
<br>
While working away quietly in the corner of the castles crowded kitchen, Mirella had overheard the headwoman giving instructions to the cooks on how the newly captive princess was to receive her meals. The plan was to have one servant only, escorted by the guard, take the princess her gruel and bread. She would be given only enough time to eat the meal, then all the empty plates and bowls were to be taken away.<br>
<br>
"I'll have no chatter up there, and no kindness shown either," said the headwoman to the cooks. "And I shall hand pick the girl to take her food up to her. She'll receive no pity from us, defying her father as she did."<br>
<br>
Mirella burned with anger when she heard this. Olga, the Headwoman, was known to have no love for any of the king's daughters. In fact, she had no love for any woman at the castle, and had berated or beaten Mirella and the other serving girls on many occasions. Mirella was slicing tubers with a long curved knife and wanted nothing more than to dash across the room and stab Olga with it.<br>
<br>
"No..." she muttered to herself. "I've got to free my mistress..."<br>
<br>
Several hours later Mirella had conceived a plan and was ready to act. She was waiting in a dark alley, the sun having long since set, near to the north tower. She was clad in a dark blue cloak with hood pulled up, a white chemise with long billowy sleeves, and a dark blue dress the flared off her hips and thrust her ample bosom upward.<br>
<br>
However this was not all she wore. Secretly stitched into the hem and body of her dress was a thin strong cord. It would, Mirella hoped, be sufficient to reach the ground from the window, and be strong enough to hold the slender princess’ weight.<br>
<br>
Also hidden in the hood of her cloak was a small metal blade with a serrated edge. Sharp enough to saw through the bars on the window. All she had to do now was wait.<br>
<br>
Eventually she was rewarded. She heard footsteps coming from around the corner then into view came a serving girl carrying a tray laden with steaming bowls. The serving girl was hatchet faced and whistling out of tune. She certainly looked like the most unsympathetic drudge that Olga could find for this task.<br>
<br>
Bravely Mirella stepped out of the shadows. The servant noticed her and stopped, eyeing Mirella suspiciously.<br>
<br>
"Please... Hilda is it not? Please, let me take the food up to Princess Shelley." Mirella wished she could summon more courage.<br>
<br>
"Be gone with you, my orders are exact," Hilda scowled, an expression that seemed perfectly at home on her visage. She moved to walk past Mirella.<br>
<br>
"Please," Mirella placed a hand on Hilda's shoulder, stopping her. "Let me go to her... the stairs are many... you might trip in the dark... I'm only thinking of your well being..." Mirella waved her hand over the tray and three shiny coins fell onto it. Silver! An entire week’s wages!<br>
<br>
Hilda smirked, and then handed the tray over to Mirella before snatching up the coins. Laughing she turned and walked away saying, "As you wish, but you might regret it. It's an awfully cold night tonight..." And with that she was gone.<br>
<br>
A brief walk later Mirella knocked on the door to the tower, she barely had time to think of Hilda's cryptic warning. The door was opened by a tall sour faced guard. He leered over Mirella as she entered the tower, gazing at the swells of her breasts. Another guard was idly sitting on a stool next to the start of the curved steps. Above her the tower loomed in darkness. Mirella moved to take the tray up the stairs.<br>
<br>
"Halt!" The guard by the steps rose to his feet, but it was the other one who spoke.<br>
<br>
"Sir?" asked Mirella, trembling slightly. The tall guard held out his hand for the tray. Placing it on the table he rummaged through it for a while, searching for hidden items. Mirella breathed a sigh of relief. When he finished she made to move towards the table and collect the tray but this time the second guard spoke, "No lass. Not before you strip."<br>
<br>
"What?" Mirella did not think she heard him correctly.<br>
<br>
"Olga's orders. You take the food up, but your clothes stay here."<br>
<br>
Trembling Mirella stared at him. This would ruin all her plans! But she could not flee now or they would suspect her. She hesitated. The guards began to close on her.<br>
<br>
"Don't want any little gifts getting up to the princess now do we?"<br>
<br>
"B-But..." Mirella stammered. She could not bear the shame of being exposed so.<br>
<br>
"Strip! Now! Or we do it for you." They both smiled.<br>
<br>
Mirella undid the clasp on her cloak. With a heavy swish it fell to the floor taking her serrated blade with it. Her fingers shaking she undid the laces on the side of her dress. They were knotted and awkward and she could feel the growing impatience of the two guards.<br>
<br>
"Move it along wench, don't be all night about it."<br>
<br>
The laces undone she stooped forward, lowered the dress from her shoulders and slid it down over her full hips. Now gone was the rope! The guard in front had a splendid view of her melon heavy breasts, trembling with nervousness. The guard behind could only look her delectable rump. She straightened up and stepped out of her dress, now clad only in her loincloth and chemise, its flowing length only barely covering her bottom.<br>
<br>
"P-Please... may I go up now?" Mirella's face was flushed rosy red, and the same shade seemed to blossom slowly down her neck to her breast. A thin bead of sweat rose on her forehead, despite the fact that she now felt cold and vulnerable.<br>
<br>
Slap! The guard behind her slapped her backside sharply with his gauntleted hand. Mirella gave a little scream in surprise and pain. Her eyes watered.<br>
<br>
"The shirt as well wench. I'll not ask again." The tall guard scowled, but there was lust in his eyes as well.<br>
<br>
Shaking as would a leaf in the wind, Mirella pulled the chemise up slowly. First her rounded belly was exposed, then her quivering, heavy breasts. Crying quietly in shame she lifted the garment over her head and dropped it on the floor with the rest of her garb. She stood trembling before them, hands clasped to her chest in a vain attempt to preserve her modesty. She could feel in her hands that her nipples had become hardened as she stood there, cold and exposed.<br>
<br>
With a harsh tearing noise her loincloth was torn from her body. Sharply it cut into her nether parts, stabbing into her quim painfully before the flimsy garment gave way. She turned quickly, her body jiggling, to see that the guard behind her now had the last shreds of her clothes in his hands.<br>
<br>
With one hand she now covered her womanly thatch, and with the other struggled to hide her breasts. All her efforts to preserve her modesty were in vain as she squirmed out of the way and tried to face both guards.<br>
<br>
"What ho," said the taller guard. "You are a fine strapping lass." They stepped back from her and gazed intently at her quivering form. Her face was crimson now, and her eyes stained with tears. So choked with shame and tears was she that Mirella was unable to speak in reply.<br>
<br>
"Take off your shoes" the shorter guard instructed. Without bending down the servant girl feebly kicked off her shoes. Now she was totally naked and terribly miserable.<br>
<br>
"Now take the food up."<br>
<br>
Sobbing and broken in her humiliation she crossed to the table and took the tray in her hands. She was able to hide the nipples of her ample breasts behind the bowls on it but now her bottom and mound were exposed totally. The tall guard grabbed a flaming torch off a wall bracket and waved the humiliated serving girl up the stairs in front of him.<br>
<br>
Every single step was an agony. The guard followed her up, leaving his companion behind to guard the entrance. Mirella could feel the weight of his stare on her jiggling, exposed rump as she heaved herself up the stairs.<br>
<br>
She was not sure what was more distressing to her. That she had been totally denuded before these men, or that her plan to rescue the princess was doomed already to fail. She prayed silently that the guard below would not inspect her discarded clothes. The penalty would be terrible indeed if her attempt at rescue was discovered.<br>
<br>
At one stage she yelped as the flames from the guard’s torch licked painfully at her arse. Another time the scalding hot broth was splashed slightly onto her right breast, stinging her smooth skin and causing her to cry out again.<br>
<br>
After what seemed to be an eternity they arrived at the top of the steps outside the chamber door. There was a guard sitting outside the door on a stool. He looked up, saw Mirella's shadowy naked form and smiled, unlocking and opening the door to the princess’ chamber to let the serving girl inside.<br>
<br>
As the door shut behind her Mirella almost dropped the food in shock. Shelley was huddled next to the wall and shivering in the cold wind. Mirella gasped in dismay and after placed the tray down on the floor she dashed to her mistress' side.<br>
<br>
"My lady! My lady! Oh..." Mirella wrapped the quivering princess in her arms as she sank to the floor next her. Weakly Shelley managed to open her eyes and smile.<br>
<br>
"Mirella? Oh thank the heavens." The fair princess leant into the embrace of her naked servant and started to cry. Even though Mirella herself was already trembling with cold she could feel that her mistress was already as a statue of ice.<br>
<br>
Mirella tried to will what little strength and warmth she had left into Shelley. Trembling in each other's arms for many moments they rested there, Mirella feeling her Lady's tears splashing onto the soft skin of her bosom.<br>
<br>
Reluctantly Mirella broke from the embrace and fetched over the tray saying, "You must eat my Lady. Please." Feebly Shelley took in the broth and bread. Slowly through the food, and the warmth from her serving girl's nude body, strength began to return to the princess.<br>
<br>
Between mouthfuls flowed questions and explanations. The princess's servant spoke of her plan and her frustration at her failure.<br>
<br>
"Do not be sad my brave, brave Mirella." Shelley smiled kindly and pulled Mirella close in her arms once more, this time as a comforting gesture.<br>
<br>
"But I failed you mistress..." the pain in the serving girl's voice was plain to hear.<br>
<br>
"But you risked all for me, I... I want to tell you how much... that is..."<br>
<br>
The Princess was cut short as suddenly footsteps and raised, angry voices were heard outside the door. Suddenly it was flung open and there stood Olga! She appeared to be furious and in her hands clutched Mirella's rope and saw blade. With horror Mirella realized that Hilda had gone straight to the headwoman and had voiced suspicion to her.<br>
<br>
"HOW DARE YOU!" Olga screamed at the cowering servant. The two younger girls clung to each other as the Headwoman roared.<br>
<br>
"I'LL SEE YOU STRIPPED, FLAYED AND HUNG BY YOUR HAIR FROM THE RAMPARTS!" Olga turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door shut. The princess and her servant blanched as they heard the door lock; now shutting them both away from the world outside.

<p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Chapter Three: Araelle's Price</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Eventually, weeping, Mirella fell into a troubled sleep.  She dreamt that she was naked and being pursued through the dark fields by moonlight. And that all the hunting hordes of Duke Edgar were galloping after her. Bloodthirsty hounds, foaming horses and the deafening sound of hunting horns. The riders were all grim and faceless as she ran nude before them. All except one: Gregory, his handsome visage distorted in an evil grin, led the surge of riders in an attempt to trample her.<br>
<br>
As Mirella lay there on the cold stone floor Shelley lay beside her. The nude serving girl would quiver from time to time and sigh in distress at her dream. Thinking that she was cold Shelley did her best to warm her friend, taking the servant in her arms and drawing her close.<br>
<br>
The princess was unable to sleep, for she knew that the situation was now more grim even than before.<br>
<br>
'Poor, foolish Mirella,' The Princess thought to herself, tears forming in her light blue eyes. 'If only you'd kept away. I can't protect you from your fate. I'm still to marry Edgar, but the king may execute you for trying to help me.' The thought of this filled Shelley with immense grief and sorrow. She counted Mirella among her closest and most dear friends, even though her role was one of servant.<br>
<br>
Tears streaming down her cheeks she prayed again, with all her will, for a divine release from this indenture for herself and her friend.<br>
<br>
The pleas of one tiny mortal were not enough to rouse the god's interest. As the great stars swirled slowly about the sky the forlorn girls entreaty fell upon deaf ears, involved as the gods were in their own affairs of far greater importance. And so her prayers arched out into the night, fuelled by a sorrow and concern so great that they simply had to be answered. But not, it seemed, by the gods.<br>
<br>
In the many shadows of a land bathed in moonlight nestled some less savoury spirits. Not close in stature to the gods they were, nonetheless, keenly intelligent and magical all the same.<br>
<br>
Shadow was their shroud, their body, their substance. And any who encountered them in their various forms gave them different names. Shade, spectre, ghost, revenant, demon... devil.<br>
<br>
One such creature on this night was lurking in the shadows of an old lightening-blasted tree. The tree was slowly dieing and it was this gradual decay that drew the shade to it. Neither male nor female, and having no realized form, it merely lurked, waiting patiently for someone to give it purpose.<br>
<br>
It was this creature that first heard the prayers of the princess. That first realized that a task had been placed before it. Even without a countenance it smiled, then rose from the shadows about the tree born on angular wings. A large raven flew towards the castle, trailing a black mist faintly behind it, the bird's eyes gleaming almost of their own green light.<br>
<br>
Princess Shelly was first aware of something amiss when she heard a rustle of silky wings from the window. A shadow briefly passed over the moonlight but by the time Shelly had looked there was nothing, only the full moon staring balefully at her.<br>
<br>
Shelly could not tell why but suddenly she was scared. 'Don't be silly.' she thought to herself, 'there's nothing there.'<br>
<br>
Just to be sure though she slowly sat up and rose to her feet, after carefully untangling herself from Mirella so as not to wake her. Noiselessly she padded over to the window that was set at the height of her own face.<br>
<br>
'There it was again,' she thought, startled. It sounded like the rustling of wings.<br>
<br>
She was but a breath away from the barred window when a large black shape suddenly landed on the sill outside. Shelley jumped and yelped in fright as the raven alighted, folding its wings and regarding her evenly. It did not seem remotely bothered by her shout.<br>
<br>
Mirella, however, was woken.<br>
<br>
"My lady?" groggily she sat up, hugging her arms around her pendulous breasts for warmth.<br>
<br>
"Worry not Mirella," the princess replied. "Tis just a blackbird. It startled me."<br>
<br>
The two girls regarded the raven with wide eyes, for they knew it was not a good omen for them. The raven regarded them back with its own cold, green eyes.<br>
<br>
"I am Araelle." The voice was clear, angelic almost. And neither male nor female, but strangely both. When it spoke it did not move its beak, and although Shelly heard it as though it had been whispered into her ear, Mirella seemed not to notice.<br>
<br>
Shelly stood there stunned. Slowly she backed away from the new arrival.<br>
<br>
"My lady? What's wrong?"<br>
<br>
"It-It spoke to me..."<br>
<br>
"My lady?" A concerned look crossed Mirella's face.<br>
<br>
"You seek release from your captivity. I am here to give you a means with which to escape." The bird fixed both eyes on Shelley, ignoring her servant.<br>
<br>
"Who are you?" Shelley spoke aloud.   <br>
<br>
At the appearance of her mistress talking to the winged creature Mirella made a frantic holy gesture with her hands and backed away from the window, huddled in fright.<br>
<br>
"My Lady? What is it? Surely this is not the time for jest."<br>
<br>
The raven ignored the serving girl, fixing its cold hard stare on the beautiful princess.<br>
<br>
"I am Araelle." The black bird repeated, its crystal like voice resonating inside Shelley's mind. "And I will provide you with assistance if you accept my price."<br>
<br>
Immediately Shelley felt herself grow more afraid. She wanted to ward the bird away but doubted it would take heed of such efforts. She realized the danger of bargaining with a beast of seemingly dark origin, yet in her heart she wanted escape from her prison and freedom for her friend more than anything else.<br>
<br>
Keeping her eyes on the window Shelley addressed the serving girl, who was still sitting on the floor staring in amazement at them both.<br>
<br>
"He says his name is Araelle." Shelley said, even though she could not discern the beasts true nature. "And that he is here to set us free." Concern crept into her mind. "Can you not hear him speak?"<br>
<br>
"N-nay mistress I cannot. And it fears me so to hear you speak thus." Dark omens, voices she could not hear, Mirella again made a superstitious warding gesture with her hands.<br>
<br>
Shelley, however, was a little more steadfast.<br>
<br>
"Name your price." Although she realized that she had little to offer.<br>
<br>
"One lock of your fair hair," was the reply. The princess was almost certain that the dark avian seemed to be smiling. Perhaps it was just the shadows cast by the moon. Shelley informed Mirella as to what the bird requested.<br>
<br>
"No my lady! Do not do it! It is evil and... and... you should not be giving things like that. Not to him. It is dark magic I say!" Mirella rose and dashed to her mistress, taking her hand.<br>
<br>
Shelley turned and looked into Mirella's eyes and saw love and concern underneath a veil of fear. She said nothing in reply, only drawing the girl to her and embracing her. The princess felt the shivering, nude form of her closest friend against her own body and smiled, looking into the serving girls dark brown eyes.<br>
<br>
"I would see myself in a pit of fire before I would marry Edgar." She almost spat the name of the Duke out as if it were venom from her soft lips. In her heart the fair princess realized that she would also sacrifice every freedom and pleasure she had if it meant saving her friend Mirella from torment.<br>
<br>
"No! Mistress! Please!"<br>
<br>
Gently Shelley leaned into her companion and placed a soft, yet loving kiss on her cheek. Immediately the servant’s worry abated.<br>
<br>
"Trust me Mirella. I know it sounds strange but I think my prayers have been answered."<br>
<br>
Wide eyed, Mirella watched as Shelley broke from their embrace and walked again to the window. She did not understand why, but her heart was pounding so loudly in her chest that she was sure her lady could hear it. The touch of Shelley's lips to her cheek had stunned, yet pleased her. Confused at these feelings that welled up within her the naked girl merely stood still, arms at her sides, just watching.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation Shelley reached up and gently plucked a single shimmering hair from her head. It shone with an eerie silver light as she reached through the bars of the window and presented it to the raven, who calmly took it into his beak.<br>
<br>
Immediately the hair seemed to take a life of its own. It grew and thickened, rapidly turning into lengthy, yet thin, silvered rope. The bird dropped it as it transformed, knotting itself around the bars of the window and slithering down the outer wall of the tower. Shelley stared in amazement. Mirella gasped.<br>
<br>
"But..." Shelley said, realization dawning. "I cannot pass between the bars! That is of no use to us. You said you would free us!"<br>
<br>
"No. I said I would provide you with assistance. I have. If you request further aid than it too will come with a price."<br>
<br>
"How will you help us this time?"<br>
<br>
"I will alter your stature so that you may pass through the bars. You will return to your true form after a brief time. This too will come with a price."<br>
<br>
Conflict raged within the princess. She realized that she must be careful, for the raven had not deceived her by telling untruths. She had deceived herself for not closely heeding what it had said to her.<br>
<br>
"How long will I be smaller?"<br>
<br>
"By the time the sun rises again in this land you will be returned to your natural form."<br>
<br>
Shelley thought on this.<br>
<br>
"Agreed," she finally said, reaching again for a lock of her hair with which to pay.<br>
<br>
"No." Said Araelle, its voice impassive. "I stated not the price."<br>
<br>
Shelley froze. 'No,' she thought, 'what have I agreed to?'<br>
<br>
Slowly, starting from the lowest hem, Shelley's elegant blue dress began to unravel. The thread began to snake away from her across the floor, climbing the wall and spiraling out into the night sky. As it did Mirella watched in awe as the slender, beautiful girl was denuded by this strange magic.<br>
<br>
Her dress slowly disappearing, the normally modest princess blushed as her feet were uncovered, she was only wearing soft brown leather slippers... then slowly her calves, the soft white skin gleaming in the moonlight. Away flew the thread, slowly shortening her silken garment. With a rustling noise her knees were exposed, and then inch by inch her slender yet well formed thighs. Gasping in surprise and shock Shelley could only stare as her dress evaporated, now in two separate threads.<br>
<br>
Red-faced the princess placed both hands in front of the delta of her thighs. She felt the soft slithering under her hands as the dress crept up, now exposing all of her legs and her sole undergarment, a pale white loin cloth that covered very little indeed.<br>
<br>
Instinctively she cried out. "No! Make it stop!" The great black raven ignored her, its eyes seeming to bore into her very flesh.<br>
<br>
The dress was now coming away in five threads. Lace and stitch and ribbon all untied themselves and started pouring away from the girl's nubile body. So very slowly was the shy princess’ belly exposed as the dress shortened, trim and supple was she. Mirella could not help but stare, feeling concerned for her mistress’ safety, yet compelled to do nothing but watch.<br>
<br>
With one hand Shelley grasped at the flying thread, the other remaining between her thighs in a feeble attempt to protect her modesty. Shocked as she was, she also felt confused, for her gradual de-clothing seemed as the gentle touch of a lover. Shelley could only imagine such things as she was still innocent in the ways of love, yet despite her embarrassment she felt a strange warmth within her body that she could not explain.<br>
<br>
As though it were a blue line trailing a field of soft white skin the dress continued to dissipate, approaching the young girl’s breasts. Shelly gasped again, hunching over, her knees trembling and locked together. She stopped grabbing at the fleeing thread and placed her free arm over her breasts as they too were slowly uncovered. The cool night air kissed and caressed the sensitive skin of her chest. The princess gasped at the cruel, yet titillating sensation.<br>
<br>
Her face a deep shade of red, and tears forming in her eyes, Shelley was confused to feel the points of her nipples budding out from the rounded swells of her breasts.<br>
<br>
"Please... no... don't... stop..." Her voice trailed off as the line of her dress rose up and split to uncover her shoulders, slightly rounded and firm. Now the threads were many. They flew down her arms exposing limbs that belayed a princess' gentleness. Shelley was an active young woman and while her body was slender it was certainly not weak.<br>
<br>
The last of the thread flew away out the window. Shelley whimpered, having never felt more vulnerable and naked in her entire life. She felt her shoes fall to pieces, the stitching unraveling, the leather gliding swiftly across the floor, up the wall and out the window as if guided by and spectral hand.<br>
<br>
Trembling, embarrassed and frightened, the beautiful princess was to receive one last shock.<br>
<br>
There was a violent tug between Shelley's legs as her loincloth was wrenched painfully into the soft folds of flesh between her thighs. Shelley gasped in pain and grabbed at it with the hand covering her womanhood but it was to no avail. Briefly it cut painfully into her rear and then, with a loud tearing noise, flew swiftly out the window and into the darkness. Quickly Shelley replaced her hand in front of her, but not before her smooth hairless mound was exposed, gleaming in the cold light like a pale silver treasure.<br>
<br>
Again Mirella's heart pounded. She was looking at her mistress from behind, and despite herself, could not stop staring at the princess's backside as she stood there hunched over. 'This is wrong,' she thought to herself, 'I've seen her naked before. Why have I never seen how... how... beautiful she is?' Mirella blushed, embarrassed and startled at her own thoughts. She wanted to hold the princess in her arms and keep her covered and warm. And although she did not realize it, she felt the first stirrings of a forbidden longing that she could not explain.<br>
<br>
Shelley stood there for a moment. Trembling. Nude. And splendid. For it was not without good reason that she was considered the most fair of the king's daughters. She was an active girl who enjoyed riding and walking about the realm and it showed in her form, wonderfully slender and yet firm and well rounded were a woman should be. Her pale skin and long silver-gold hair seemed to shine starkly in the moonlight from the window. She was very much the vision of desire and innocence that poets write of, that bards sing of.<br>
<br>
Slowly she straightened up, yet kept her hands in place, refusing to wipe away her tears. Almost defiantly her eyes met those of the glistening black bird.<br>
<br>
"I-I've paid your price." Shelley's courage was slowly returning to her. "What is to happen now?"<br>
<br>
Araelle simply replied, "Close your eyes child." The voice of the raven was impassive as always.<br>
<br>
Shelley did so. Cold, nude and apprehensive, she had many regrets about agreeing to Araelle's price. But she would do anything to secure release for herself and Mirella. Bravely she stood still and firm, ready for whatever the hellish crow had in store for her next.
