      { title: "Chapter 1", summary: "Megan is processed at the ENF Stable.", content: "There was I. Arms and head locked in a pillory. It wasn't affixed to poles in the ground, but rather to a chain that my captor was holding onto. He was up on a horse, riding slow enough for me to keep up but forcing me to keep a steady pace. I was his prisoner.<br><br>I was also completely naked.<br><br>It was, of course, completely humiliating. We had passed by so many people - not just on the road, but through villages. The pillory felt tight around my wrists; my arms ached to be lowered to cover my breasts and pussy but were locked securely next to my neck. I felt every brush of air on my naked body. I felt every glance and stare and grin and grimace too.<br><br>I was the prisoner of an ENF catcher. I had a bounty placed on me, and he had tracked me down, made me strip naked, and then tied me up and dragged me through the countryside. Any disobedience and he spanked me - hard. My ass was red raw after I tried to escape that one time.<br><br>~~~~<br><br>My captor lead me through the woods to a building. The front of it was modern and clean, with a stable attached to the side. I could see that the back reached further than a normal building, especially an inn one would find in the woods, which confused me and left me curious. A young man came out of the stable; my captor climbed down from his horse and handed the reins to the boy. I wasn't sure whether to be offended or relieved when the boy didn't give my naked body a second glance. I wondered how many naked women had passed through here, that mine was simply another piece of meat to him.<br><br>My captor pulled on the chain connected to my pillory, and I obediently followed him into the building. It was a beehive of activity. There was a central desk at the entrance with a woman sitting at it. To the left were desks within cubicles and dozens of people writing; to the right were couches and chairs with people dressed like my captor, sitting and reading and talking. Behind the desk was a door.<br><br>‶Hello,‶ said my captor. ‶I'm here to process Megan Bandini. She doesn't know my name, and I'd like to keep it that way.‶<br><br>‶Of course,‶ said the woman at the desk. She glanced at me, then down at my body. I was convinced she was trying to make me feel more naked. It worked. The pillory binding my arms to my neck felt tight. She looked down at the papers on her desk. ‶Looks like room 7 is free. Alexa will meet you there.‶<br><br>‶Very good. Thank you.‶ My captor pulled me - with force but not crudely - around the desk and through the door behind it. Behind it was a corridor; at the end was a door marked 'STABLES', but he took me through another door on the left marked 'PROCESSING'. Behind that was another corridor, down which there were a series of doors, each labelled with a number. My captor, of course, took me down to room 7.<br><br>It was a small room. There was a contraption in the middle - it looked like an iron cage with no bars. In the top were manacles attached to thick bars, at the bottom was a circular plate with manacles. My captor turned a wheel on the side, causing the top manacles and bars to lower. He pulled me over to it and unlocked the pillory. I struggled against him.<br><br>‶Megan,‶ he said. ‶If you don't let me put you in this without a fight, I will give you ten spanks.‶<br><br>How humiliating. To be treated as if I needed to be tamed. I complied. He placed my wrists in the manacles and locked me in, then turned the wheel to raise my arms as high above my head as possible. The manacles felt cold and hard. My body felt exposed.<br><br>The door opened, and I impulsively tried to cover up; of course, my arms were held above my head. As an older woman holding a clipboard walked in, my captor fastened manacles to my feet.<br><br>‶Good lord, you got a pretty one this time!‶<br><br>‶Hello Alexa,‶ said my captor. ‶Make sure you don't use--‶<br><br>‶Yeah, yeah, the receptionist told me not to use your name. Alright, let's get this done. Name?‶<br><br>‶Megan Bandini.‶<br><br>She wrote that down. ‶Age?‶<br><br>‶Twenty-five.‶<br><br>‶Height?‶<br><br>‶Five foot four.‶<br><br>‶Weight is...‶ She looked at a dial on the contraption. ‶A hundred and fifty-two pounds. Hair colour is brown. So long and pretty!‶ She ran her fingers through my hair. I felt like I was being petted. I shook my hair. ‶Eyes are blue.‶ She sat the clipboard on a table and took a tape measure out of her pocket. ‶Measurements are...‶ She wrapped it around my breasts. I was an object being played with. ‶Thirty-seven...‶ My waist. ‶Thirty-one...‶ My hips. ‶Forty-seven!‶ She picked the clipboard back up, sat the tape measure down, and began writing.<br><br>Was this life now? My naked body a tool to be moved around and studied? The clinical way they went about it was what made it more humiliating. I am not an assortment of facts and figures. My body is the product of many hours of care. To be reduced to measurements like a slice of meat was to deny it's spiritual qualities.<br><br>‶So, we tickle her and break for lunch?‶<br><br>‶What?!‶ I spoke for the first time. I was shocked.<br><br>‶Yes,‶ said my captor. He walked over to me, grabbed my sides, and began gently rubbing my armpits with his thumbs. It was so sudden! One swift motion and I was putty in his hands. I screamed with laughter. I shook. The manacles kept my feet from kicking upward, so I stomped my foot as if that would relieve the tension. It did not. My armpits were so sensitive. I cackled with laughter.<br><br>The worst part was how powerless I felt. I cried out for him to stop and he silently continued. He went long enough that I started to believe I had always been tickled - that I was born in this room being tickled and any images of a past life were a dream. He moved his hands down to my sides. I felt even more naked than before. Every inch of my flesh was free for him to tickle. I pounded against my restraints as best I could.<br><br>It was then that Alexa, grinning, walked over to me and picked up a foot just enough to tickle the undersides.<br><br>‶Oh noooooooooo!‶ I cried. My whole perception was taken up by the sensation of being tickled. I fought it has hard as I could. My eyes were raw from the tears; my throat was torn up by laughing. ‶Please! Ahahahaha! Please stop, I beg you! Hahahaha!‶<br><br>It was an agonising amount of time, but my captor finally stopped and motioned to Alexa to do the same. He dragged a chair over to me as I sniffed. He adjusted the manacles binding my wrists; they disconnected from the base, still connected by a long chain. He put the chair behind me so I could sit. My feet were still manacled to the floor.<br><br>I collapsed into the chair. My face and neck felt hot. Dropping my arms to protect my armpits felt safe. I might have been naked and locked up, but my mental armour was returning. My captor and Alexa walked out of the room.<br><br>‶What did I do to deserve this?‶ I asked.<br><br>Without even looking back, my captor replied, ‶You killed an innocent person.‶<br><br>I felt a spike of white-hot rage as I watched him go." },
      { title: "Chapter 2", summary: "Megan is used as decoration with other ENFs.", content: "I was wearing a black dress with whitestars across the fabric and ruffles at the neck and cuffs, a purple cloth faux-belt, a tall black top hat, pointed black high heeled boots, a sensible amount of make-up, and lacy red underwear safely covered by all of it. I was a tough, sexy broad who was not to be trifled with.<br><br>‶Ma'am, I'm sorry, if you don't have a ticket, I can't let you in.‶<br><br>I was currently being trifled with. It was a young man acting as valet for the theatre. It was a showing of The Woman With A Thousand Outfits And Nothing To Wear. I had the chance to buy tickets for months, but I intentionally chose not to. The game of winning tickets simply by throwing my weight around was too exciting.<br><br>I took a moment to prepare myself for the joy of every word of this sentence: ‶Do you have any idea who I am?‶<br><br>‶Sorry, ma'am, I don't.‶ If he was exasperated by the cliche, he held it back.<br><br>‶I am Megan Bandini.‶ I relished the look of horror on his face. I use my family's money to fund theatres, restaurants, musicians. A well-placed word from me and I could destroy a career - certainly this fool's career, something he could have avoided if he'd recognised me.<br><br>‶Oh lord! I'm sorry, Miss Bandini,‶ he said, his face turning white.<br><br>‶I should think so,‶ I said, mentally planning on putting a bad word in for him.<br><br>‶Which seat would you like?‶ he asked, pitifully unaware of the fate that was waiting for him. My secret plan made me feel powerful. His desperate flailing to please me was only funnier knowing his destruction was inevitable and imminent.<br><br>‶A box seat, please,‶ I said. My polite but firm tone was practically arousing. I was toying with him! I and I alone controlled his fate.<br><br>‶Megan Bandini?‶ said a man's voice behind me.<br><br>‶Yes?‶ I turned. It was a man in a simple cloak and uniform holding a crossbow.<br><br>‶You are under arrest in the name of the King for the crime of murder.‶ He pointed the crossbow at me. ‶Take off your clothes.‶<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. My hands were tied behind my back so that each hand was gripping my opposite elbow. There was a rope tied around my neck, with the opposite end held by my captor as he led me through a corridor. It was an opulent mansion; paintings on the walls, tapestries, fine furniture. We turned a corner and I saw a corridor with a dozen naked women lined up along the sides. Their wrists were tied to hooks on the walls and they were all wearing pendants. Some of them had green numbers on them.<br><br>There was a gap in the space of two of them. My captor lead me to it and began untying me. As soon as I was free, I began to struggle.<br><br>‶Megan.‶ His voice was sharp but emotionless. ‶I will no longer warn you. The next time you struggle against me when I untie you, I will simply start spanking you.‶<br><br>I felt the echo of the last time he spanked me. I felt great shame, but I stopped struggling. I saw the other naked women smirking at me and was humiliated. They had no right! He tied my wrists to the hooks on the walls, keeping my hands as high as possible. He then took a pendant out of his bag with a green circle on it and hung it on my neck.<br><br>‶This pendant will count the number of times you speak, Megan. For each word you say, you will be spanked twice. Nod if you understand.‶<br><br>‶Fuck you.‶ When I spoke the words, it was if the air was being sucked out of my mouth and downward. The green circle turned into a green four.<br><br>‶When I get back, you will receive four spanks.‶ He walked out.<br><br>It was me and the other naked women. I felt anonymous amongst them. That filled me with fury. I wasn't even Megan Bandini, stripped naked and dragged around in public; I was a naked woman, no more or less important than any other naked woman. What a degrading thought.<br><br>The naked women were staring at me, of course. One of them was frowning at me. She was tall and muscular, with short and very curly blonde hair.<br><br>‶You're Megan Bandini,‶ she finally said. I saw her pendant shift from zero to six and her expression shift from puzzlement to a sneer.<br><br>‶Your pendant!‶ cried out another woman. She was also tall but she was pear-shaped, with a big round belly and little boobs. Her hair was brown and tied back in a ponytail. When her pendant went from zero to four, she looked down in a panic and muttered ‶Oh no!‶, turning it into an eight. She muttered ‶Eep!‶ and it became a ten before she finally went silent, the stupid cow.<br><br>‶It's totally worth it just so this evil little shit can get her nose rubbed in it,‶ said blondie. Her pendant jumped to forty.<br><br>‶Oh, Megan Bandini?‶ said another woman. She was almost as short as me but much skinner with almost no boobs, and her hair was long and dark and black. Her pendant jumped from two to eight. She shuffled a little nervously as she seemed to process what she'd just done to herself.<br><br>There was a bit of silence. The woman looked from one to the other before curiosity finally struck one of them.<br><br>‶Who?‶ asked a woman with blonde hair that was long on one side and shaved on the other. She had an hourglass body - big boobs, wide hips. When her pendant went from zero to two, she sighed.<br><br>‶Rich. Lazy. Entitled.‶ The blonde muscular woman sneered at me as she spoke. Forty-eight.<br><br>‶Broke... plague... quarantine?‶ piped up a woman further down. She was very fat. I couldn't see her pendant.<br><br>‶Ohhhhhh.‶ A lot of women said this. Their pendants went up by two. They all smirked at me. One woman was giggling, which did not drive her pendant up.<br><br>I couldn't take it. The judgmental stares, the way they were talking about me - even the fact they were willing to get spanked to mock me. Rage built up in me.<br><br>‶Fuck all of you!‶ From four to twelve. ‶You're all worse than me!‶ Twenty-two.<br><br>‶Hehehe,‶ chuckled muscular blonde. ‶Anything else?‶ Forty-four.<br><br>I went silent. I felt throttled. I was restrained by by both these ropes and this stupid pendant. I tried fighting against the ropes, to no avail. I growled and stomped my feet. This only made the naked women laugh harder at me.<br><br>This was when we heard someone coming." },
      { title: "Chapter 3", summary: "Megan's body is studied and she witnesses a spanking.", content: "I was wearing a flowing purple dress of fine material. It was warm and comfortable, molding perfectly to my underthings and my body.<br><br>‶And here are the models,‶ said Jerry. He was one of my oldest friends - a tailor who designed many of the clothes I loved to wear. Five women trotted out from the next room wearing outfits he has designed.<br><br>‶These clothes are beautiful,‶ I said. I touched the fabric on one of them and felt the soft velour. The model blushed and jerked back. ‶Stay still! Stupid woman.‶<br><br>‶Terribly sorry, Lady Megan.‶ Jerry shot a dirty look at the model. ‶Models are not to be noticed, Sally! You don't want to draw attention away from the dress.‶<br><br>‶Quite right,‶ I said. ‶Why do you think he hires such plain-looking models? If you were beautiful, I'd be looking at you.‶<br><br>The model - Sally - blushed even more. I savoured the feeling. It's what she deserved.<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. My arms were tied to the wall above my head. I was in a corridor with a dozen other naked women who were tied up similarly.<br><br>There was someone coming down the corridor.<br><br>No, there were two people. They were giggling and whispering. A man and a woman came around the corner, clutching each other. He was kissing her. She gasped and smiled when she saw us.<br><br>‶Look at all these naked women!‶ she said.<br><br>‶Yeah,‶ said the man. ‶They're ENFs. My father books them in as decoration.‶<br><br>‶How beautiful. They're absolutely gorgeous.‶ She reached out to touch the pear-shaped woman when the man slapped her hand away.<br><br>‶Don't touch them! If you do, their handlers will know, and then you'll get stripped and paraded around naked too.‶<br><br>‶Ooh, maybe I want that!‶ She giggled and kissed him. ‶Wouldn't you love to see me naked, tied up, and shown off for all to see?‶<br><br>He smiled bashfully. ‶Er, um, kinda?‶<br><br>She laughed again and tapped him on the nose. ‶I know you well enough to know that means yes!‶ She looked over to us again. ‶What do these numbers around their necks mean?‶<br><br>‶Well, uh, they're not allowed to talk while they're here. Every word they say, the pendant goes up by two. When their handlers comes back, they'll be spanked.‶<br><br>‶I see. Naughty girls. Good gods!‶ She stopped to look at the muscular blonde woman. ‶Fifty-two! This one couldn't stop talking apparently! A real chatterbox!‶ Blondie looked down and held herself stock-still, terrifically embarrassed.<br><br>‶I'd like to see whoever has the job of spanking her,‶ said the man.<br><br>‶I've decided this one is the most gorgeous,‶ said the woman, walking up to me. ‶It's everything in me not to start kissing her and never stop.‶<br><br>‶She's a bit fat,‶ said the man. My temper flared up but the pendant hanging around my neck was a reminder to hold my tongue.<br><br>‶That's what I love about her,‶ said the woman, looking back to him and then back to my body. ‶Fat people are soft, like cushions. Look at her skin too - I bet that's really soft.‶<br><br>‶I'd rather be feeling your skin, Sophie‶ said the man, cuddling up behind her and kissing her neck.<br><br>‶Ahaha! That sounds creepy as hell but I know what you actually meant.‶ She turned and kissed him on the lips. ‶All these naked women are making me so horny. I don't know what they must be doing to you.‶ She grabbed his crotch. ‶Aha! Just as I thought.‶ She leaned in an in a stage whisper said: ‶Know that when I'm sucking you off, I'll be thinking of her.‶<br><br>As they giggled and wandered off, I fumed. It's a degrading thing, to be the naked foreplay for some fatuous couple. Even worse for them to critique my body. The ropes felt tighter around my wrists.<br><br>Many of the other women were looking at me. Some of them were grinning, presumably at my being openly studied. My rage was contained; I would not say a word to them. The blonde muscular woman was blushing deep red and looking down.<br><br>Some time passed. More people walked past us; servants, an older well-dressed man, and at one point a small crowd of tourists lead by a guide that openly laughed and pointed when they saw us.<br><br>Then a little older man dressed almost exactly like my captor came around the corner. He was humming a jaunty tune. He walked right up to the blonde muscular woman.<br><br>‶Hello Vivian, my dear!‶ he said in a very refined accent. ‶You will, of course, be able to talk freely as soon as I take - good gods! Fifty-four?‶ He looked at her in shock. ‶Vivian, you naughty girl! I expected better of you.‶<br><br>He cast a spell. Tentacles emerged from the ground and lifted him to Vivian's chest, where he lifted the pendant over her head and put it in his pocket.<br><br>‶Yes Sir! Sorry Sir! I'm a naughty, naughty girl, Sir!‶ cried out Vivian. She looked to be in absolute terror of her captor. It was pathetic and amusing.<br><br>‶You are!‶ he said, untying the ropes that bound her to the wall. She immediately brought her hands behind her back for him to tie together, which he promptly did. ‶Well, put your nose against the wall, my dear. Let's get this done. Count the spanks and thank me for them, you know how this works.‶<br><br>She obeyed, bending over to press her nose to the wall. He captor held his hand against her ass, then pulled it back, then brought it down on her hard.<br><br>‶Ah! One, thank you, Sir!‶ Crack! ‶Mmm! Two, thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>As she received her spanks, I found myself uncomfortable and like the ropes were straining against my wrists. Not because I wanted to cover up, but because there was something really sexy about this.<br><br>‶Twelve! Thank you, Sir! Aw, thirteen! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>Vivian's naked grovelling before her master; her cries of pain with every smack; the way her ass got redder and redder. The fact that she was so tall and muscular and he was so short made it sexier. I admit, so did the fact that she had so cruelly taunted me. Seeing her get what was coming to her turned me on.<br><br>‶Twenty! Thank you, Sir! Ahahaha, twenty-one! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>By that point, I think it was really starting to hurt her. Her ass was very red and she started to wiggle and shuffle her feet. Her captor waved his hand and muttered something; tiny portals opened in the wall and floor, and tentacles emerged, holding her by the neck and feet.<br><br>‶Hold still, dear.‶<br><br>‶Yes, Sir! I'm sorry, Sir! Ah! Twenty-two! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>God, I ached to touch myself watching this! I wanted to see her cry! I wanted to see her beg for mercy! Spank her raw! Spank her raw!" },

When he tied me down to sleep, I had carefully and methodically cut the rope on a rock I found. Despite the cold of the night, I was warm - except for my bottom, the one place that madman hadn't rubbed that cream. I instinctively rubbed my wrists but I felt no scratches or pain there like I expected. Evidently, the only discomfort this pervert wanted me to feel was humiliation.<br><br>I had to think. It was hard to keep track of time, but I figured I was maybe five hours out from the city. I looked up trying to find the North Star. We'd been travelling eas--<br><br>‶Megan.‶ A hand came down on my shoulder. It was him.<br><br>‶Gods damn it!‶ I started to run, but he gripped my shoulder more tightly. He waved his other hand and muttered an incantation, and tentacles sprouted out of the tree above me, gripping my wrists. ‶No! No! No!‶ They gently but forcefully pulled me up and around so I was standing and facing the tree.<br><br>‶You've been a bad girl by running away, Megan, and for that, I'm going to spank you. I'm going to spank you twelve times, and I want you to count each spank and thank me for it. For every spank you don't count, I will spank you two more times.‶ He raised his palm.<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. My hands were tied to the wall above my head. I was in a corridor with many other naked women, tied to the wall just as I was. Exposed and on display.<br><br>Then he came walking down the corridor.<br><br>His expression was, as always, one of polite indifference. He walked up to me, looked down at the pendant around my neck, then gently grabbed it to look closer. If he was surprised or offended by the number twenty-two, he didn't show it. This chilled me to the bone; the fact that this asshole had such tremendous control over his actions made it so much harder to figure out how to get one over on him. He was like a machine.<br><br>‶I'm going to unchain you, Megan. Then I'm going to spank you twenty-two times, reflecting the number of words you spoke. This is just as I promised. If you had kept silent, you would not be getting spanked right now.‶<br><br>I felt my eyes go wet and my face and neck get hot. This was entirely unfair! He didn't have the right to spank me in the first place! This is not how things were supposed to be! I could hardly be expected to keep my mouth shut - to ignore the prodding from others! This wasn't my fault! This wasn't my fault!<br><br>He sat a stool by the two of us before undoing the chains holding my hands in the air one by one, then tied my wrists behind my back. He pulled me over to the stool, sat down, and pulled me over his lap. He raised his hand in the air and brought it down hard on my butt.<br><br>----<br><br>WHACK!<br><br>The pain was sharp and agonising. For a second it was all I perceived. I heard a gutteral cry and by the time I processed it was me, it happened again.<br><br>WHACK!<br><br>Tears filled my eyes. It hurt so much! I had never been spanked before. I shook and wiggled but I was stuck fast where I was.<br><br>WHACK!<br><br>Gods help me! The pain went through my body like a wave before leaving a small burning sensation that was still there when he spanked again. And it wasn't just the pain! It was the humiliation! I was naked and powerless, being punished by an unimaginable power like some disobedient litle creature. I was weak! I was weak! To my great shame, I started to sob.<br><br>My captor leaned down by my ear.<br><br>‶Megan. I have spanked you three times and you have neither counted them nor thanked me for them. I promised you twelve spanks. I have spanked you three times without a word from you. You're already going to get another sixteen. Ask yourself if you're sure you want to stretch that out further.‶<br><br>I gritted my teeth. Tears continued to pour down my face. My heart was heavy and my shame was impossible to calculate. But I knew what to do. He brought his hand down on my again.<br><br>----<br><br>WHACK!<br><br>‶Ah! One! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I thought knowing it was coming would make it hurt less but no - my ass was on fire. The shame of thanking him for a spanking - an embarrassing punishment! As if I deserved it! As if I were begging to submit to a hard slap on the bottom! - compounded it.<br><br>WHACK!<br><br>‶Mmm! Two! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>And worst of all: I was being watched. A dozen or so naked women, tied with their hands far above their heads, humiliated prisoners on display for anyone to see, and right now I was lower than any of them. They could look upon me and feel pity.<br><br>WHACK!<br><br>‶Oh! Three! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>The shame. The shame. Naked. Restrained. On display. Spanked. Punished. Oh gods! Why was this happening?! I didn't deserve this! I didn't deserve this!<br><br>Just because I killed someone!<br><br>The bottom dropped out of my stomach.

But I felt so racy and naughty. Wearing this around a group of revolutionaries was so exciting.<br><br>‶Haha! So then I simply showed my fake identification to the officer, and he arrested the man chasing me instead! I got clean away!‶<br><br>Everyone in the room laughed uproariously. I giggled. The man speaking, Jerry Taron, swigged his drink and them beamed at the room. He then looked towards his friend. ‶Kome! Now you should tell them about your daring bank robbery!‶<br><br>‶Of course! Of course!‶ Kome launched into a story in which he robbed a bank while wearing a cast on a foot (feigning that it was broken) as well as a false moustache and grey wig. But I kept sneaking looks at Jerry.<br><br>He was so handsome. His charisma made him seem so much taller than his average height. He hadn't bothered to shave for a few days. He cropped his black hair short enough that he probably didn't have to take care of it but long enough that it must have felt great to run your fingers through it.<br><br>I was head-over-heels for him. I wanted to kiss those soft lips of his, feel his weathered revolutionary's hands running down my body, and bite his neck hoping it would turn him on.<br><br>Then he looked at me. My heart skipped a beat. He kept looking at me and he smiled warmly. I knew I had him then.<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. My wrists were bound together by rope and then tied to a tree branch above my head. My captor was currently in the process of rubbing the protective cream onto my body.<br><br>‶Megan. Stand still.‶<br><br>He was rubbing it onto my breasts. To my consternation, it felt really good - warm and soft. I couldn't stop moaning and giggling. When he finished up (covering everything but my ass), I felt warm and comfortable, as if I were in a hot spring rather than naked in a forest. It repelled dirt and bugs and other nasty things; everything except the eyes of others and the humiliation that brings.<br><br>He untied me from the tree and tied my wrists together behind my back, then tied a rope around my left ankle, looped it up through my wrist bindings, and tied the other end to my right ankle. There was enough slack for me to walk comfortably, but somehow it did leave me feeling more bound. He then hooked a leash around my neck, climbed on his horse, and started marching me through the forest.<br><br>It took us a few hours to get to a village. As usual, we - I - received stares. Farmers in their fields did double-takes, ignoring their tools. Maids were churning butter, only to look up, continuing to press the pedals of their machines but failing to turn the handle.<br><br>What a revolting development. All these rough salt-of-the-earth peasants staring at my naked body - my tits, my ass, my pussy, my thighs. I couldn't help but stare at them in rage. They smiled back at me, gleeful to see a naked woman. One woman blew me a kiss. I almost swore I could feel something on my cheek and wondered if she was some kind of mage, or if in my humiliation that my imagination was running away with me.<br><br>My captor led me to the local tavern; after tying up his horse, he pulled me under the tavern's porch, unbound me, then tied a rope to one of my wrists, threw the rope over one of the porch roof's support beams, then tied the other end to my other wrist. He then pulled my right foot up off the round and tied the remainder of the rope around my right ankle.<br><br>The result was that my arms were bound above my head and my right foot pulled up in the air, with me left standing on my left foot. There was no reason for this except to torture me further with a more awkward and compromising position; he could simply hang me up like this and there was nothing I could do about it. I could see the sneers and amusement of the peasants.<br><br>They came out to gawk and smile at me. I saw a couple holding hands - the man staring at me with open lust, the woman cheekily grinning. She whispered in his ear and he looked at her in amazement as she laughed. I scowled. This is my fate? To be fuel for some villager's sexual escapades? The thought of him thrusting into her as they both got off to my predicament made my skin burn. I tugged uselessly at the rope burdening my wrists.<br><br>‶Look at her, trying to get out!‶<br><br>‶Look at her boobs jiggle!‶<br><br>I stopped, suddenly hyper-aware of everything my body was doing. They laughed harder. I tried not to cry from the shame. I hoped my eyes glowered! I hoped my anger emanated from me! They would not see my shame, they would not!<br><br>A woman came out of the crowd. She was dressed in a simple peasant's outfit - a drab, cheap brown with a tacky bunch of teddy bear patches sewed on haphazardly. She had short mousy-brown hair.<br><br>‶Look at you,‶ she smirked. ‶All nakey.‶ She walked around me, looking me up and down. ‶Cute little belly. Gorgeous butt. ‶<br><br>‶Go away!‶<br><br>‶Hey, now that I look closer, I can see you've been spanked. Pretty hard too!‶<br><br>‶Leave me alone!‶<br><br>She walked right up into my space. ‶You been a naughty li'l nakey girl? Is that how it is?‶<br><br>That's when it finally clicked. I saw the way she was looking at me and realised she wanted to touch me. I had to suppress a grin when I felt the surge of power come over me. This dumb peasant clearly had no idea about the rules this madman lived by. I had to be very careful how I approached this.<br><br>‶Y-yes I have.‶ It was harder than I thought to say those words. ‶Please don't punish me any more than I have been. I just want to be left alone.‶<br><br>‶Oh, I'm not gonna hurt you, naughty li'l nakey girl.‶ Come on, come on, come on! ‶What did you do to get punished?‶<br><br>Damn it! ‶I was... I did...‶ I blushed and looked away. Why did I suddenly feel an acidic taste in the back of my throat?<br><br>‶Aw, nakey girl. Whatever it is, it sounds like you didn't confess. Strong-willed nakey girl, tied up with one foot in the air and still not confessing. That's sad and beautiful.‶ She then leaned in and kissed me on the lips.<br><br>I was surprised at the sudden warmth and joy I felt at human touch that wasn't being bound or spanked. But even more than that, I was grinning at having won." },

I was clutching Jerry's arm as we strolled through the park.<br><br>I looked up at his handsome visage and swooned. His soft blonde beard; his scruffy hair, only barely tamed by a casual brush; his warm and kissable smile, creating these gorgeous crinkles around his eyes.<br><br>‶You're a handsome man,‶ I said.<br><br>‶I know, babe.‶ Such casual confidence! I pulled him in for a kiss, and his kiss was almost grateful.<br><br>As we continued walking, we came to a lake. He let go of me and walked over to it. ‶Let's go skinny-dipping!‶ he said. He immediately stripped off his shoes, shirt, and pants, revealing his very hairy chest and long, skinny cock. I blushed but ogled him as he folded his clothes and sat them down. I thought his cock was beautiful; I wanted to touch it and make him cum and see what his face would be like as he was felt up.<br><br>‶I'll tell you what,‶ I said. ‶You swim to the bottom of this lake and grab a stone. If I think it's beautiful enough, I'll strip off and join you.‶<br><br>‶Sounds like a deal,‶ he said, grinning cheerfully. As soon as he dived underwater, I grabbed his clothes and ran for it. I heard his shocked cries behind me a few seconds later, and the thought of him walking home with his hands over his crotch made me grin.<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. My arms were tied above my head. My right foot was tied and held aloft. And the dumbest peasant woman in the world was kissing me and feeling me up.<br><br>What surprised me was how sweet her lips tasted. It made me curious. What did some dumb peasant drink to taste like that? Was it on purpose? She put one hand on my hip and the other around my butt. It seriously turned me on; her rough peasant hands gently caressing my soft behind.<br><br>Then she moved down to my breasts. She sucked on one nipple and teased the other with her thumb, which made me squeal. I was being publicly fondled! I looked over to the crowd smirking at me as I moaned. I felt so horny and dirty. I felt like an object - I felt every patch of skin exposed to the air. It felt humiliating, but why did it feel so goo--<br><br>Suddenly it stopped. I involuntarily groaned in frustration. I was so horny now! These damned restraints! The woman was smirking as she took a seat on the porch. She knew exactly what the fuck she was doing, working me all up and then not satisfying me and leaving me without a damn thing I could do about it.<br><br>But I had a card to play. That felt good to know.<br><br>After some time, my captor came back out.<br><br>‶That woman!‶ I struggled against my restraints, eventually (ridiculously) trying to point at her with my raised foot. ‶She touched me! That means you have to strip her naked!‶ I was aware my rhetoric wasn't as good as it would usually be, but I made my point.<br><br>The woman scoffed. ‶She's lying! She's saying that because I teased her.‶<br><br>‶You didn't touch her once?‶ asked my captor calmly.<br><br>‶Nope,‶ she said, putting on an air of complete innocence.<br><br>My captor clicked his fingers. A spark of purple fire appeared in his hand, blanketing him in purple light. He pointed it towards me, and my body glowed with blue spots. I was confused. He then walked over to the woman. Her hands glowed with the same blue dots, and when he raised the fire to her face, it glowed around her mouth. Her expression turned to a rictus of horror.<br><br>She started to run and he cast a spell. Two tentacles emerged from the tavern's porch roof and grabbed her by the wrists.<br><br>‶No! No!!!‶ she cried. She started kicking, and he cast another spell. Two more tentacles emerged and grabbed her by the ankles. ‶I don't want to be naked! I don't want to be naked!‶ My captor pulled out a fancy-looking dagger and she went bug-eyed. ‶Please! You don't have to do this! Noooo!‶<br><br>He cut her top from her neck down, tearing it right in half and revealing her surprisingly large breasts. I realised she had been wearing a baggy top to hide how big her boobs were. I smirked. She struggled as my captor cut her pants down the side of her leg before finally just giving up and almost going limp. I laughed maniacally as she sobbed.<br><br>My captor leaned in. ‶If you hadn't touched her, I wouldn't be doing this to you.‶<br><br>I saw her face crumple. That brought me joy. She was the cause of her own humiliation. She tried squeezing her legs together but her thick patch of pubic hair was quite visible. I have to admit, seeing that fucker naked and humiliated turned me on. She had a strong tan on her arms that ended where her shirt had begun.<br><br>She saw me studying her body and looked down in shame. I was overjoyed. Finally, someone else to absorb the shame! I felt a surge of power that I hadn't since this whole misadventure had began. She was blushing, she was quiet - I had shut that bitch up!<br><br>‶Now,‶ said my captor, turning to me, ‶to give you your tickle torture, as I had originally intended.‶<br><br>Oh no! I felt like a cold hand had gripped my heart. ‶Please, Sir! You don't have to do this!‶<br><br>‶It's part of your punishment, Megan,‶ he said as he raised his hands. He grabbed my side with his left hand and traced his finger down my armpit.<br><br>‶No! No! Ahahahahaha!‶ I struggled under his powerful grip. It was like lightning gently kissing my skin. Laughter was forced out of me. He then went for it - both hands softly scraping my armpits, over and over. I laughed and I shook but no matter how I moved, he kept in position.<br><br>He stopped. I caught my breath and saw the villagers watching me. They were having a grand time. They were laughing at me! The fuckers! I was their godsdamned amusement! My breasts heaving as I laughed! A naked bouncing heaving naked lady, tickled for their amusement! I felt small, and I felt weak, and I felt powerless, and most of all I felt naked! Naked! Naked!<br><br>Then he began again. I laughed and laughed and begged him to stop. To my great surprise, he did, only to grab my raised foot and start tickling that. I shrieked, shaking it as best I could, but he explored every crevice of it, inbetween my toes.<br><br>I closed my eyes, still laughing. That's all there was, the sensation of being tickled. It felt like a nightmare. I was never an all-powerful lady with the love of a revolutionary who crushed anyone who bothered me. I was just naked and tickled.<br><br>Finally he let go. I gasped for air. The sensation faded. I still felt the breeze on my skin. As if I could be tickled again at any moment. I was crying. I felt humiliated. Degraded. I was empty. No pride, no dominance. He looked upon me impassively, then nodded and walked back inside.<br><br>I realised that naked women held by tentacles was still looking at me." },

We were both on the porch of a tavern where any passerby could stop and look, and quite a few did.<br><br>I was too embarrassed to take any joy in her humiliation. After tricking her into getting stripped naked and restrained, I had had the life tickled out of me. I felt degraded and empty.<br><br>Eventually my eyes did wander over the body of the woman who had tried to taunt me. She had mousy brown hair cropped to fall down to her ears. She had surprisingly big boobs she'd kept hidden under a baggy shirt, and she had wide hips with a thick, curly patch of brown pubic hair.<br><br>She saw me looking and stared at the ground. I saw her clench her legs together in a fruitless, pathetic effort to hide her pussy. I admit, the fact that I could keep staring at her naked body and there was nothing she could do about it made me feel very powerful. I could feel her growing increasingly uncomfortable with me watching her.<br><br>She started to struggle against the tentacles holding her in place. She let out these adorable little grunts as she totally failed to move her wrists even a fraction of an inch. The grunts turned into curses as she started wiggling her arms and knees. Then she started shaking her whole body as she shrieked.<br><br>‶Stop looking at me!‶ she wailed.<br><br>‶No,‶ I said, sneering as I watched her breasts bounce around.<br><br>‶This isn't fair! This isn't fair!‶<br><br>‶Isn't it, nakey girl?! Is it not fun to be naked and on display? A grotesque punishment nobody warned you about!‶ I felt my heart swell with power. ‶You're naked and there's nothing you can do about it, and I'm going to drink in your body while I can!‶<br><br>She shrieked again before descending into sobs. She seemed to sag a little. She was defeated. I felt something awaken in me. Seeing that moment where she simply sank into her humiliation - where the walls came down and she realised how naked and exposed and weak she was - really... turned me on. Just like before, I ached to touch myself. If only I didn't have these damn restraints! It was like I sank back into the knowledge that I was tied up in an even more awkward position. Oh yeah - I'm naked too with one foot in the air.<br><br>It was okay for now. I'd found some power again.<br><br>----<br><br>It was some time later when my captor came back out. He untied me, then retied my hands behind my back.

You can't do that!‶<br><br>My captor waved his hands, casting a spell. A tentacle emerged from the roof above her. ‶That tentacle will protect you. Anyone touches you, it will grab them. I hope this makes you feel comfortable.‶ He then clicked his tongue, turned his horse around, and pulled me away. I couldn't turn my head back because we were moving too fast and I had to watch where I was walking, but I heard her sobbing. Then she cried out ‶Stop looking at me!‶<br><br>----<br><br>After travelling on the road all day, we settled down for the night. My captor went through our routine - tying my wrists above my head to a tree branch and applying the protective cream. To my surprise, he then cast a spell. A small patch of purple goo shot right out of his hand and onto my face, spreading over my mouth.<br><br>‶Hey! What the hell?‶ was what I intended to say, but it came out as ‶Mmmm! Mmm mmm mmm?‶<br><br>‶I'm going to restate your situation, Megan,‶ he said. ‶You have been a bad girl. You are being punished. You have already been deprived of your clothes and your freedom. If you try and use me to hurt other people, I will punish you further. I'm going to uncover your mouth and then you'll apologise to me for your actions today. After this, I'll spank you. If your apology is completely honest and accountable, I will only spank you five times. The more you lie, evade, or downplay your actions, the more I'll spank you. Understand?‶<br><br>I nodded. He waved a hand over my mouth, causing the goo to crumble away. I cleared my throat.<br><br>‶I'm very very sorry for egging that woman on so that you had to strip her naked in front of everybody.‶ He didn't respond and simply stared at me, which made me uncomfortable. ‶I'm... also sorry for making fun of her? I think?‶<br><br>‶Is that your whole apology?‶<br><br>‶Yes? I think?‶<br><br>He nodded. ‶Seventeen spanks it is.‶<br><br>‶What?! That's not fair!‶ I panicked as he walked around me. WHACK! ‶Owwwwwww! One! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I started to cry and shake. The fact that I could have somehow talked my way out of all these spanks only made it more humiliating.<br><br>‶Awwwww! Three! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I racked my brain trying to think of what I could have said or done differently and hated myself for feeling like I was giving in." },

We had been heading uphill very gradually for days - as if he wanted to get somewhere in particular in the hills but didn't want to overexert his horse getting there.<br><br>What surprised me the most was how goddamned horny I was. I hadn't been able to touch myself since this whole humiliating escapade started - not just because my hands were restrained at almost all times, but because I never had any privacy. Hah! Privacy. My mind would often wander back to the time when I was allowed to wear clothes - the Before time. It only made me feel more naked. I felt air on my skin where previously I would feel cloth.<br><br>We came up to village wall. I heard it before I saw it: whistling. Actual, factual wolf whistling. I looked up and saw people in guard towers by the gate into the village.<br><br>‶Hey there, beautiful!‶ called down a gruff voice. ‶Nice tits!‶<br><br>‶Bet I could make you scream in six seconds!‶ cried out another voice.<br><br>‶Yeah, watch that ass jiggle!‶<br><br>I felt my face burning. I hadn't heard anything this crude before. I had been gawked at and even lusted after, but this was the first time I'd really felt like a sexual object. I could feel my skin in a way I never had before, and every layer or roll of fat on my body, and it all felt permeated with the idea of sex. It was a new level of humiliation I had not known of. I tried to fight it! I wasn't just some idiot's wank fodder! I'm a strong, smart woman in a bad situation!<br><br>‶I'm gonna jerk it to you later, babe!‶<br><br>My heart was burning.<br><br>The gate opened, revealing a primitive barbarian village. There were lots of huts with smoke coming out of the top. A massive bonfire was in the centre of the village, billowing smoke. And most importantly, there were throngs of barbarians wearing many layers and thick woollen coats.<br><br>Many of them turned to see me and instantly started pointing and laughing.<br><br>I tried keeping my shoulders high. Fuck 'em! But my arms felt very tightly bound behind my back.<br><br>My captor was approached by a particularly ostentatiously-dressed barbarian. She wore a cloak made from a dire wolf and her face was painted with an elaborate collage of colours. Her lips were pierced with golden rings and I could see hints of tattoos on her neck that were covered by her thick woven clothes.<br><br>‶Ah, my friend, you bring another one of your naked bitches, huh?‶ I scowled at that. ‶Ha ha! She takes offence to that! But that is what you are. You are naked and you must do whatever this man says. That makes you his bitch.‶<br><br>‶It's good to see you again, Liltok,‶ said my captor.<br><br>‶Likewise, my friend. Worry not, I will not let your true name slip. Come, come. Let us tie this bitch up, that we may feed you and then punish her with my latest and best idea.‶<br><br>Liltok took the lead from my captor and pulled me, much more roughly than he ever did. I was forced to walk faster. She was hurting my neck.<br><br>‶Her name is Megan, by the way,‶ said my captor.<br><br>‶You are not acting nearly submissively enough, Megan,‶ snarled Liltok. ‶You should be showing me more respect, let alone this man. Stop fighting me. Look down. Say 'yes ma'am' and 'no ma'am' when I give you orders.‶ I scowled. ‶You're lucky I don't tan your hide for that look!‶<br><br>‶Megan,‶ said my captor. ‶If you don't do exactly what Liltok tells you, I will spank you five times.‶<br><br>I rolled my eyes and followed the letter of what she said - I bent over in a parody of submissiveness, I started walking slightly faster, and I said ‶Yes ma'am!‶ in a tone dripping with irony.<br><br>‶Remember, Liltok, only I have the privilege of spanking Megan.‶<br><br>‶I understand,‶ said Liltok dismissively. ‶You're not gonna have any reason to strip me naked. No matter how disrespectfully Megan talks to me.‶ She said my name with such disdain that I did actually flinch, to her amusement. What a horrid woman.<br><br>She pulled me over to the south end of the village. I saw a large pole - like the mast of a ship, except there was a gruesome face carved into it about five feet off the ground. It looked like a demon with a mouth wide open in a horrific grin. Next to it was a big bucket - about a foot high and with a three foot radius - full of water and apples.<br><br>‶Alright, Megan,‶ said Liltok. ‶Your job today is to take every single apple out of the bucket and put them into Saint Wendell's mouth.‶ She took my leash (my Gods, I was calling it my leash) from around my neck and hung it from a hook on the side of Saint Wendell's totem. ‶Needless to say, I will not be untying your arms.‶<br><br>I looked down at the bucket. It was low; I would have to get on my knees to reach the apples. I saw barbarians starting to make a crowd watching me. Dread came over me like a cloud on a sunny day. Each day in this nightmare was more humiliating than the last.<br><br>Liltok slapped my butt, causing me to flinch.<br><br>‶Get on with it, Megan!‶<br><br>With a heavy heart, I got on my knees and dipped my face in the bucket." },
      { title: "Chapter 9", summary: "Megan fails at her task and is punished accordingly.", content: "I was wearing a pink sundress with tiny yellow hearts sewn at the bottom end. I was also wearing long sheer stockings,<br><br>I was splayed out on a fainting couch in John Delmonte's lounge room. John was lying face-up on the ground, his eyes shut and his hands behind his head. Abigail was sitting cross-legged in a blue dress with white frills, playing with some string that she was folding and unfolding with her fingers.<br><br>‶They're living in the past. Imagine the dirt and smell of the barbarian peoples,‶ said John.<br><br>‶A dirty life of grime,‶ I said apathetically, enjoying playing with the words.<br><br>‶That's life for them,‶ said Abigail, not looking up. ‶That's what they get. Most people get what they want, I think, and if you want to live in filth and muck, you deserve it.‶<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. And I was near tears.<br><br>My ass was in the air as I tried desperately to grab an apple with my teeth. I could hear the laughter of a crowd of barbarians - their jeers and taunts filled my ears. I had been at this for what felt like hours and managed to get maybe half a dozen smaller apples. Now I was running into the bigger ones that were harder to grab onto. I was covered in cold water that made my nipples rock hard. The fact that my hands were tied behind my back meant I nearly fell in multiple times.<br><br>I bit at the apple in front of me and it bounced off my teeth. I grunted in frustration. I tried snapping at it a few more times and it just kep slipping under my grip.<br><br>‶Look at her ass shake as she goes for it!‶ I heard a man yell. My ears burned, as much because they saw my failure at a simple task as because of my nudity.<br><br>I bit in and finally grabbed it. As I lifted it, there was a sarcastic cheering for me. Suddenly, it fell from my lips back into the bucket. The cheers turned to laughter. I finally just gave up. I fell backwards onto my ass and sat, tears falling down my face. This was so fucking stupid! Why couldn't I manage this?! I felt even stupider as I was sobbing. I felt weak and stupid and naked. The crowd were in helpless giggles. I loathed them for their leering at my body and enjoying my failure.<br><br>‶Come on, Megan,‶ said Liltok, sneering. ‶You have a job to do.‶<br><br>‶No! This is stupid! Why do I have to do this?‶ I felt my voice coming out whiny and was ashamed. She simply smirked as I sat there sniffling.<br><br>After some time, my captor returned. He looked down at me.<br><br>‶Megan, why are you simply sitting there? Were you not asked to feed Saint Wendell?‶<br><br>‶It's too HARD!‶ I sobbed. ‶How is this even possible?! With my arms tied up and how cold the water is and-and-and--‶ I was enraged by my own stutter. ‶NAKED! This isn't fair! It's impossible!‶<br><br>He looked down at me impassively as I cried. He walked over to the totem and grabbed my leash off the hook. He walked over to me and put it around my neck.<br><br>‶Stand up.‶<br><br>I obeyed, still sniffling. He pulled me through the town back over to his horse. He then opened one of the bags hanging off the horse, took out a stool, and sat on it.<br><br>‶Lay across my lap, Megan.‶<br><br>‶Oh no, Sir!‶ I realised what this was about.<br><br>‶You did not do what Liltok told you. You were warned you would get five spanks for it. Lay across my lap. I won't ask again.‶<br><br>‶No! No!‶ I sobbed again. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me across his lap. ‶This isn't fair! This isn't fair! ARGH!‶ The sharp pain of his hand hit my ass. I cried. I shook my legs. I wiggled in place. But I wasn't strong enough. He was holding me down with what felt like impossible strength. ‶ARRGH! Nooooooo!‶ The pain of the spanking! It was too much! It was humiliating! ‶Ohhhhhh!‶<br><br>‶Megan. I've spanked you three times now. You have not been counting them or thanking me. You know I'll spank you an additional time for each time you don't.‶<br><br>‶Fuck you!‶ I cried out through tears. ‶Fuck you and your fucking horse and your rope and your hand and... and... my leash and... fuck you! ARRGH!‶ He had waited until my spiel was done and then simply spanked me again! I continued to cry as he methodically spanked me.<br><br>And then it was like a switch turned in my brain.<br><br>There was no source behind it, no reason for it to happen. It's like my brain simply accepted this. Maybe the physical pain and psychic humiliation had simply reached the point that my pure instinct seized on the only way out. Maybe my pride finally broke.<br><br>‶Eight! Thank you, Sir.‶<br><br>It wasn't just what I was saying. I was slumped over his legs, passively taking the spanks.<br><br>‶Nine! Thank you, Sir.‶<br><br>I said the phrase in exactly the same methodical way he was spanking me. The raw logic of it all was overwhelming me. If I had started counting immediately instead of throwing a temper tantrum, I'd be done already.<br><br>‶Ten! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>If I'd kept working on the apples instead of giving up, I wouldn't be getting spanked at all.<br><br>‶Eleven! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>If I hadn't taunted that woman or spoke with the pendant on or tried to escape, all those other spankings wouldn't have happened either.<br><br>‶Twelve! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>If I hadn't murdered a human being, I'd still be allowed to wear clothes and not get tied up or spanked or tickled at all.<br><br>‶Thirteen! Th-thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I was crying again. I couldn't believe the taste of the words on my mouth. I was actually calling him Sir. I was now actually thanking him for spanking me." },

Did you see her grandmother?‶<br><br>I smirked. ‶Yeah, exactly! Makeup running everywhere. Couldn't understand a word she said because of how scratched her throat was.‶<br><br>‶It was like someone grinding corn,‶ John said, laughing. Then he got melancholy. ‶I do miss Abigail. She would have had something hilariously cruel to say. I wonder what she could possibly have suffered that took her out so quickly? One day she was fine, then she was just pale, and then... gone.‶<br><br>I felt bile at the back of my throat. ‶Oh John, what's wrong with you?! Why would you linger on such a horrible thing?!‶ I felt my rage overtaking me. ‶You morbid asshole! She was our friend, for gods' sake!‶ I descended into weeping.<br><br>‶Hey! Hey! Shh shh shh,‶ said John, taking me into a hug. ‶I'm sorry. You're right. I'm sorry.‶ He held me as I sobbed into his chest. ‶Hey. Have you seen these terrible hors d'oeuvres?‶ I wiped my eyes and sniffed as I giggled.<br><br>‶They're so dry and tasteless! Who ordered these?‶<br><br>‶I know, right?‶<br><br>----<br><br>‶Stand up, Megan.‶<br><br>I climbed off Sir's lap. My ass was red raw. I stared at the ground.<br><br>‶Look at me, Megan.‶<br><br>I looked up at him. He was still sitting. His face was impassive. I didn't know how to interpret it. All I knew was that he frightened me. It was entirely possible that he was weighing up whether he could thrash me again.<br><br>‶You stopped resisting me halfway through that. You laid there and took your spanks. That was good of you. For that, we're going to skip the part of your punishment where you were going to be run through a spanking train. The locals were going to line up, and you were going to run past them as they each spanked you once. As you have been good, this is unnecessary.‶<br><br>I hated how much my heart lifted. I don't want to be 'good'. I don't want to be naked and tied up and dragged around the country to be gawked at and then patted on the head and told I'm doing a really good job at it. I knew he was trying to make me feel good so I would associate obedience with it, and I loathed that it was working.<br><br>‶I want you to say 'thank you, Sir'.‶<br><br>‶Thank you, Sir.‶ How quickly I said it!<br><br>‶Come with me,‶ he said. He started walking away, and I quickly chased after him so he wouldn't pull on my leash.<br><br>He led me through to the centre of town, where there was a large fire. A few people were dancing around it and a few others were cooking food off of it. For a brief moment, I thought I was about to be sacrificed on it. But no - he pulled me over to a large table near it.<br><br>‶We're not going to run a spanking train on her?‶ Liltok seemed to appear out of nowhere.<br><br>‶No,‶ said Sir. ‶Megan has been good. So we're skipping to tickling her with rygars.‶<br><br>With what?! Was this some kind of torture device? Liltok looked over to me with glee. I felt a wave of gloom pass through me.<br><br>‶Lie face-up on the table, Megan,‶ said Sir as he undid my bindings. My butt was still red-raw, so I gasped with pain when I sat on the table. Sir grabbed my left wrist and, using rope, tied it to the left leg of the table. He then went around - right wrist to right leg, right ankle to other right leg, and so on.<br><br>I couldn't move. And even by my standards, I was exposed. I was pulled in four directions - the table was large enough that no part of my body was actually off it.<br><br>A lot of people had come around to watch.<br><br>I heard the sound of squeaking somewhere and couldn't figure out what it was. Sir pulled out a yellow liquid and a brush. He dipped the brush in the liquid and painted my armpit with it. I shrieked at how cold it was!<br><br>Was this rygars?<br><br>He painted me across the belly and I giggled and shook. He ran the brush across my neck, and it took all my willpower not to try and bend my neck - I knew that not fighting him would mean less punishment in the future. A laugh came out of me like a scoff from the way I was using my muscles in my neck and I felt tears in my eyes from the effort I was making.<br><br>‶Good girl,‶ muttered Sir. He then moved over to my feet and started brushing my soles. It was reduced to fits of giggles. Then he moved up a bit. I could feel each individual strand of the brush between my toes! It was more than I could bear!<br><br>‶Please, Sir! Hahahaha! I can't take much more! Hahahaha!‶<br><br>When he stopped, I knew it wasn't because I begged him to, it was because he was done. I caught my breath. Slowed my breathing. My eyes were wet, so I blinked away the tears.<br><br>He walked away, and I turned my head to see what he was doing. He was by a large box, and I could hear that's where the squeaking was coming from. He opened it and I saw him pull out a strange little furry creature.<br><br>It looked like a ball of fuzz until I saw the feet. It had two little black eyes and a long nose. Sir put it down on the table next to me, and it excitedly ran up to my armpit and starting licking.<br><br>I gasped. The thing's tongue was long and slimy, and each lick was incredibly gentle. It tickled! It was licking the liquid off my body and it tickled so much!<br><br>There was laughter coming from the crowd.<br><br>‶Look at her shake!‶<br><br>‶Like a little baby, crying from a rygar lick!‶<br><br>I shook so badly that I lifted my body off the table and slammed it back down, hurting my butt again. That was when Sir pulled out another of these 'rygars' and put it on the other side.<br><br>‶Oh nooooooooo!‶ I cried out. I was sobbing. The second one licked at my belly. It was so sensitive! Each lick bringing forth gales of laughter! And I heard the barbarians laughing at me. ‶Why?! Why me?!‶<br><br>‶Because you murdered someone, Megan,‶ said Sir.<br><br>I couldn't respond. I stared at him as my eyes filled with tears again. That's when I heard a small, quiet voice in the back of my head.<br><br>He's right. You're a bad girl.<br><br>I pushed it away as I descended into another fit of giggles." },

It was a good day. I was getting good work done.<br><br>‶You should see what the prince was wearing,‶ said Gertrude. She was also wearing a brown sack with a rope tied around it.<br><br>‶I hardly think we're in a position to mock other people's outfits,‶ I said.<br><br>‶Perhaps, but we didn't choose these outfits.‶<br><br>‶On the contrary. We chose them when we committed our crimes.‶<br><br>‶Hmm,‶ Gertrude looked down at her work with a grumpy expression. ‶I suppose you're right.‶<br><br>‶Megan,‶ said a voice behind me. I turned to see the Chief Correctional Officer. ‶Stop your work.‶ I obeyed, turning to face him and standing perfectly still with my arms by my side, ignoring the flour on my hands. This was the custom. ‶You have been found guilty of stealing. You were seen eating some leftover bread that you did not ask for. Assume the punishment position.‶<br><br>‶Yes sir.‶ I untied the rope and pulled off the sack, revealing my naked body. I got down on all fours with my butt facing the Chief. He took the paddle from his belt and brought it down on my butt.<br><br>CRACK!<br><br>‶One! Thank you, Chief!‶<br><br>This, of course, brought me back to when I was an ENF. I wondered what Sir was doing at that moment.<br><br>----<br><br>I was naked. My arms were tied behind my back.<br><br>The thing that always struck me about how Sir tied me up was that it wasn't uncomfortable. The ropes themselves felt soft to the touch, never giving me a burn. My circulation wasn't cut off, my arms were never allowed to ache - he would change up the way i was tied up frequently - and I was never in any physical pain. I just... wasn't allowed to move. I was stuck.<br><br>We had left the barbarian village and wandering through the forest. Sometimes we passed by strangers, who would delight in my nudity. I looked away from them, trying not to think about being stared at. Sir would feed me, tie me up as we slept, then retie me in the morning, and I would let him. It was after a few days of this that we got to another building much like the one he had 'processed' me in, where I had been tickled by him and that horrible woman.<br><br>He took me in. It was much the same as the last; so many people walking around in formal dress. As he spoke to the receptionist, I looked down at my body and couldn't help but see it in a new light. After days of walking and eating nothing but that strange jelly he fed me, I had lost a little weight. But it was more than that.<br><br>I looked at my body through the lens of the people who had seen it since this humiliating adventure had started. This was not the body of a lady, with refined taste and a sharp wit. This was the body of a weak and feeble woman who could be terrorised by tickling at any time. This was a naked prisoner who had been spanked for acting up. This was breasts and pussy and ass on display for anyone to see and masturbate to later.<br><br>I felt very small and silly in that complicated office, where very important people were going from one important problem to another. I was a naked girl surrounded by men and women who were getting things done. This is how so many people were seeing me. I felt myself blushing more intently than I ever had.<br><br>Sir then led me down that corridor, not dissimilar to the one that had led me to the tickle chamber. I felt very wary. But then he walked me straight up to the door that said 'STABLE' and, to my great shock, untied me. I stretched out, enjoying the relative freedom.<br><br>‶Go through this door, Megan. I'll come back to you tomorrow.‶ He walked back down the corridor. I felt very odd - this was technically the most free I'd been in what felt like a lifetime. But I knew I was surrounded by people keeping an eye on me, and I very much didn't want to go through the tickle torture door. So I opened the 'STABLE' door.<br><br>I was shocked to see that it was, indeed, a stable. It was a wooden structure with stalls along the sides and straw on the ground. The roof was a thin, slightly translucent material that let in sunlight. More shockingly, there were naked women in here.<br><br>‶Hello!‶<br><br>There were three of them. The woman who spoke waved to me. She was of average height, and she had shockingly white hair that was cropped to a short bob. She had a sharp, gorgeous face. Her breasts were large and her hips were wide, and she had a patch of white pubic hair. She didn't seem much older than I am.<br><br>Standing next to her was a much shorter woman, around my height. She had extremely curly brown hair that fell down to her shoulders in a triangle. She had a pretty aquiline nose and a heart-shaped face, and she wore a pair of round glasses. She was very thin, with small breasts that she was covering up by crossing her arms over her chest. She had a very thick, curly patch of pubic hair.<br><br>And finally, there was a taller woman, though not much taller than the rest of us. Her hair was black with streaks of red, cut in a very short pixie cut. She had more fat on her body, but a closer inspection revealed she was also a little muscular. She had clearly shaved her pubic hair recently, and you could see it growing back. Probably because she couldn't get to it tied up. For some reason, she had her hands behind her back.<br><br>‶Welcome to the Stables,‶ said the black-and-red-haired woman. She began strolling over to me, her hands still behind her back.<br><br>‶Are you tied up still?‶ I asked.<br><br>‶Huh? No.‶ She revealed her hands, waving them both in the air.<br><br>‶You seem very comfortable naked.‶<br><br>‶Well, it's nice to be around other naked women,‶ she said conversationally. ‶I'm Riley. What's your name?‶<br><br>‶Megan.‶<br><br>‶Megan. Gorgeous. Blondie over there is Simone, and the little one is Farrah.‶<br><br>Farrah waved a few of her fingers without lifting her arm.<br><br>‶Are you here because you're a slut or something, Riley?‶ I asked.<br><br>Her expression soured. ‶No. I said this to the others - I find this as humiliating as any of you. Look at this.‶ She turned, showing me her butt. There were marks on it. ‶I try to run every chance I get. Sir keeps catching me and spanking the shit out of me. But it's nice when everyone else is also naked.‶<br><br>‶What is this place, anyway?‶<br><br>‶It's an ENF Stable,‶ said Simone as she walked up to us. ‶This is where they keep us while they sleep somewhere more comfortable. You know, actually, I'm not sure what our Sirs are doing, now that you point it out.‶<br><br>‶Maybe it's a processing thing,‶ said Riley. ‶You guys got processed, right?‶ I grimaced, remembering the tickle torture. ‶Yeah, you definitely got processed,‶ Riley grinned.<br><br>‶Well, you know, I had it particularly bad,‶ I said sharply. ‶I had two people tickling me at once. That was hardly fair.‶<br><br>‶Oh, two entire people? Try getting a spanking train. I ran through a whole crowd of people slapping my ass. I was red-raw by the end of it.‶<br><br>‶I was made to follow a very strict dance routine, and was spanked for every mistake I made at the end,‶ said Simone melancholically.<br><br>Farrah mumbled something.<br><br>‶What was that?‶ I asked.<br><br>‶I said,‶ she said, a little louder. ‶You must have done something to deserve it, like I did.‶<br><br>I was infuriated and stormed up to her. ‶There is nothing we could have done to deserve this! What the hell is wrong with you?!‶<br><br>‶Well,‶ she said. ‶I killed someone, to start with.‶" },

She uncrossed her arms and put her hands on her hips, as if in defiance. Her nipples were perky and cute. ‶That's right. I'm a murderer. I was working as an accountant. And my boss was an absolute witch.‶ Her eyes went a little glassy as she remembered. ‶Worked us hard. Criticised every little mistake. She was horribly unpleasant to be around and made me feel so small.‶<br><br>‶You are small, Farrah,‶ said Riley.<br><br>‶One day, I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed an axe, I went to her house, and I brought it down on her withered old lady head.‶ Farrah started to choke as she said this. Her eyes had tears in them. ‶Almost immediately, I felt the horrible guilt. I washed the blood off myself in her house and slipped out. And when I got home I kept trying to wash the blood off. I felt like I stank of it.‶<br><br>This filled me with disgust and contempt. Her beautiful face with that aquiline nose looked like a shadow was cast over it.<br><br>‶You're an idiot,‶ I said. I started walking around her, like a predator teasing its prey. Something about us both being naked made it primal. She side-eyed me, which only made me feel more powerful. ‶You could have gotten away with it if you were smarter.‶<br><br>Farrah smirked. ‶I'll bet you were caught the same way I was. Your Sir just showed up without warning, pointed a crossbow at you, and told you to strip off. I was at work at the time. After weeks of being torn apart by the guilt, seeing that woman's face in my dreams and behind every corner, Sir shows up and I'm naked in front of people I see every day. I was supposed to think my way out of that?‶<br><br>I scoffed. ‶You're so weak! You're weak! A coward! You kill someone and at the first pushback you get, you give up! You submit to this whole... this whole... You let a guy strip you naked and tie you up and tickle you!‶<br><br>Farrah seemed to go sad at that. She wasn't looking at anything in particular. ‶I am weak. I am a coward. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm being punished. This is a good thing.‶<br><br>I felt a spark of rage in myself. How could this woman allow herself to be degraded - to be tickled and naked and spanked to the point of tears - and not want to fight it every step of the way? What was wrong with her? How could she simply accept the shame within her?<br><br>‶Alright,‶ I said. The fury in me had become focused. I knew what to do next. ‶You think you deserve to be punished? Let's do it then. Let's punish you.‶ I shoved her to the ground.<br><br>‶Hey!‶ cried out Simone.<br><br>I ignored her. I straddled Farrah, pushed her right arm up, and furiously tickled her.<br><br>‶HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!‶ she cried out. Her eyes were scrunched up tight. I felt power! For the first time since I'd taken my clothes off, I felt power again. My fingers explored every inch of her armpit.<br><br>‶Megan, stop it, please!‶ Simone begged.<br><br>‶HAHAHAhahaha...‶ Farrah started wheezing, trying to control her breathing. ‶Is that...‶ she panted, ‶the best... you can do?‶ She then used her other hand to push my arm back. ‶My Sir is stronger and more terrifying that you could ever be.‶ I couldn't tickle her and hold her arm back at the same time. I was enraged.<br><br>Suddenly, Riley pushed both of Farrah's arms back, holding her at the wrists. I looked up at her in surprise.<br><br>‶Tickle her, babe.‶ Riley said, grinning. ‶Punish her like she wants.‶<br><br>Farrah and I looked at each other. I was shocked by what I saw: fear, anger... and also acceptance. She wanted this. She had called me down upon her with her actions. For half a second I was confused. Something felt wrong about this. Like I would be hurting myself somehow.<br><br>‶Fucking do it, you dumb bitch!‶ screamed Farrah. That kicked me into gear. I scraped my fingertips against her soft little armpits and she started howling with laughter. I felt dizzy with power. I felt high. Now I was the one dishing out tickling. Every laugh was a demonstration of my power.<br><br>The fact that she was naked made it even better. Riley might have been the one holding her arms up, but it was because of me. Because I caused her to. Farrah had been hiding her little breasts before, but now she couldn't. She was naked and on display because of me.<br><br>And I was punishing her. I was teaching the stupid little cow a lesson about saying dumb things. I watched tears come to her eyes, and I saw her starting to relax and her laughter slow down as she got used to the tickling, so I shifted down to her belly and rubbed my thumbs on her to get her going again.<br><br>It was then that Simone came over and started tickling Farrah's feet too. Farrah started making this weird chuckling noise. She screamed that this was more than she could bear. She was crying as she laughed. Riley put her knees on Farrah's hands and started tickling her neck. We were a united tickling machine; the fact that we were all naked made it hard to see where I ended and she or the others began.<br><br>And that was how I saw myself in Farrah.<br><br>I looked at her and realised I could see exactly what she was going through. I had had all these things happen to me. I knew how it felt to be helpless, tickled, naked, on display. I even knew how it felt to be tickled by multiple people.<br><br>But now I knew how it felt to be Sir. I knew how it felt to punish someone by forcing them to be naked and on display and tickling them. I knew how it felt to punish a murderer with nudity and tickling. I don't know what it was exactly - how this heady mixture of seeing things from different perspectives seemed to open me up - but I could see it now. I did deserve what was happening to me!<br><br>I stood up. Riley and Simone were still tickling Farrah, who started writhing without the weight of me on her. They all stopped and looked up at me. Farrah was panting and sweating.<br><br>‶What's wrong?‶ asked Simone.<br><br>‶I need one of you to spank me.‶<br><br>----<br><br>‶Ten! Thank you, Chief!‶<br><br>There were tears in my eyes. The chief had exceptional strength, and his spanks had a habit of leaving my butt purple for a few days. It stung. I stood up before him, clasped my hands behind my back, and looked down. I said nothing, because I didn't have permission to speak yet.<br><br>‶What do you have to say, Megan?‶ he asked.<br><br>‶I'm sorry for stealing the bread. It won't happen again.‶<br><br>‶Good girl. Get dressed and go back to work.‶<br><br>I obeyed. I picked my sack back up and pulled it over my head, tying the rope back together. I went back to kneading dough. Gertrude looked embarrassed, as she always did when someone got punished in front of her. That was good - perhaps it would stop her acting out.<br><br>As I kneaded the dough, I let myself feel the ache in my behind. I let the shame flow through me. I had been a bad girl, and now, through naked spanking, I was a good one again.<br><br>Later, we were peeling potatoes. I chose to stand because I simply could not sit properly. The chief came into the room.<br><br>‶Attention, girls. Another ENF is coming to Campbell-Taylor Manor. Finish your job and then attend the Meeting in the Great Hall.‶<br><br>As soon as he stepped out, there was whispering amongst us. We all knew what it was like to first enter the Great Hall - naked, led by our Sir, and the center of attention. We excitedly finished our work as fast as we could.<br><br>As we each finished our job, we lined up at the door, two-by-two. When the last of us was done, the guards marched us through the corridors of Campbell-Taylor until we reached the Great Hall. Prince Reynard's throne was empty - we, of course, would be forced to wait for him rather than the other way around.<br><br>The grand entrance to the Great Hall was opposite the throne, of course. Us ENFs - all dressed in sacks and rope - were lined up both sides of the throne, with the guards lined up behind us. We were there for what felt like forever before nobles started walking in, seating themselves beside the throne.<br><br>I spent my time silently thinking about my horrid, shameful life. I found so much more meaning as a frequently-naked, frequently-spanked servant in the prince's castle than in the hedonistic lifestyle I'd had before. The humiliation of being naked; the pain in my butt from spanking; it felt cleansing in a way the plays and food and jokes never did.<br><br>Finally, the prince entered. He didn't even notice us. He sat, bored, on his throne. The grand doors immediately opened. There was a man, dressed just like my Sir, walking into the room, and he was holding a leash connected to the neck of a naked woman with her hands tied behind her back and her head down in a shameful pose.<br><br>When I saw the woman properly, I had to stifle a laugh." },
      { title: "Chapter 13", summary: "Megan submits to a spanking from another ENF.", content: "There were beds in each of the stalls of the Stable - straw arranged on wooden frames, but beds nevertheless.<br><br>‶Who's going to spank you?‶ asked Simone.<br><br>‶I will,‶ said Farrah resolutely. She sat on the bed. ‶Get over here, Megan. I'm going to spank you ten times.‶<br><br>I felt that pang of rage - at being told what to do, at being barked at, at feeling weak - pass through me, and then I walked over. I began to lay over her lap, but then she put her hand up.<br><br>‶Stop. I didn't tell you to lay over my lap yet. You're going to get five more spanks for that.‶<br><br>I bristled. But I did nothing. I was shocked how okay this felt. Farrah was a smug little asshole, and it felt okay to submit to her.<br><br>‶When I tell you to do something, I want you to say 'Yes, ma'am' or 'No, ma'am' as appropriate. When I spank you, I want you to count them and say 'Thank you, ma'am'. Do you understand?‶<br><br>‶Yes, ma'am.‶<br><br>‶Now you may lay across my lap.‶<br><br>I did so. Her naked skin felt warm and comfortable and soft against my own. It was so different from when I laid across Sir's lap. Farrah rested her hand on my butt. It felt like a caress. She then lifted it and brought it right down.<br><br>‶One. Thank you, ma'am.‶<br><br>It didn't hurt at all. Farrah didn't have nearly Sir's technique or strength. I did exactly as she asked and did nothing to pretend it hurt. That was on her, as the one spanking me. I think she realised because she brought her hand down harder on me.<br><br>‶Two! Thank you, ma'am.‶<br><br>It still didn't hurt. I was strong. She was weaker than Sir. I found myself thinking of what Farrah had said when I was tickling her. Nothing I did to her must have been as bad as what he did.<br><br>‶Three! Mmm! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>It was starting to get uncomfortable. She was really putting her full force into it. I adjusted on her lap a little.<br><br>‶Don't move on my lap, Megan,‶ she said. ‶For that, I'll give you another two spanks.‶<br><br>I gritted my teeth. It was just on the precipice of unfair. She was doing it because she knew I was taking it better than she'd hoped and she wanted to make me hurt. Sir would never do that.<br><br>‶Four! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>Now it was starting to hurt. My butt was burning a little with pain. The sound of the slap was sharper.<br><br>‶Mmm! Five! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>The pain was compounding with every hit. I flexed my toes, as if that would help.<br><br>‶Oh! Six! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>This one actually really hurt, like if Sir had done it. Farrah was becoming quicker, too.<br><br>‶Seven! Grr! Thank you, ma'am.‶<br><br>Here we go! It was becoming more than I could bear! This felt right! This felt right!<br><br>‶Eight! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>Tears started forming in my eyes. Not just because it hurt, but because I felt like I was becoming myself. Punish me! Punish me!<br><br>‶Nine! Ooh! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>Her spanks were getting even harder. She was pushing herself to really hurt me. I was in thrall to this.<br><br>‶Ten! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>I was in ecstatic pain. Trying to remain still was agony that only made it better.<br><br>‶Eleven! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>I started crying.<br><br>‶Twelve! Thank you, ma'am!‶<br><br>I was a naughty girl! I was a naughty, naughty girl! I deserved to be spanked!<br><br>‶Th-thirteen! Thank you, ma'am! Fourteen! Thank you, ma'am! Fifteen! Ahh! Thank you, ma'am! Sixteen! Thank you, ma'am! SEVENTEEN! THANK YOU, MA'AM! I KILLED SOMEBODY TOO!‶<br><br>There was a pause. I tried to catch my breath as the pain in my butt throbbed. I looked up at Farrah. She was looking at me strangely. A lot of surprise, a little bit of contempt, and a little bit of... hunger? She looked over at Riley and Simone.<br><br>‶Come hold her down. I'm going to tickle her.‶<br><br>‶What?! I never agreed to that!‶ I cried out. They both came over and flipped me onto the ground, each holding down one arm and leg. There was so much naked flesh keeping me in place. Farrah straddled me, just as I had to her. My arms were being held above me. I was powerless.<br><br>‶This is happening, Megan,‶ said Farrah as she looked at me forcefully. She stroked one finger down my armpit.<br><br>----<br><br>It was Sophie. It was the woman who studied my body when I was on display with all the other ENFs in that corridor. She was tall and lanky, though she had a bit of a pot belly. Her hair was black and very straight, coming down over her eyes a little. Her breasts were a little large for her frame, and they looked a little more ungainly because she was hunched over a little.<br><br>I could read the shame on her. Her arms were tied behind her back, so she was leaning over as if that would make her smaller and harder to notice. She was looking at the ground so she wouldn't have to see the crowd looking at her. I could see purple marks on her butt - she'd recently been spanked.<br><br>I won't lie, it was satisfying to see she wasn't above it all. But I felt pity for her. I know from experience that it's hard to admit shame, and how hard she was working to deny it. Her Sir pulled her forward.<br><br>‶So this is Sophie Beauchamp,‶ said the Prince. He was lounging back in his throne, an amused look on his face.<br><br>‶Charged with theft of two hundred and fifty thousand gold pieces from the Crown,‶ said Sir.<br><br>‶Yes. We still haven't recovered all the money! Your partners must have run off with it. Well, let's take a look at your body.‶<br><br>Sir stepped aside, and Sophie slowly stepped forward. A rack on wheels was brought into the center of the room, and Sir tied her wrists in each of the top corners and her ankles in the bottom corners.<br><br>‶Look at that. You're an attractive woman, but bits of you are fatter than the other.‶ She started to cry. ‶Oh, this makes you feel shame? Your body being on display is what embarrasses you, not your crime and greed? Grow up, Sophie.‶ He looked at Sir. ‶Begin your work.‶<br><br>Sir pulled out a paddle and began spanking her. The crack of it against her butt echoed through the hall. She counted and thanked him for every single one, just like every ENF before her had done, including me. I was in awe of the process; the hubris literally beaten out of her. It was cleansing to see someone else going through what I had gone through - to feel it over again.<br><br>When he was done, the Prince spoke: ‶Sophie Beauchamp, you are sentenced to five years as a Campbell-Taylor servant. After this, you will be stripped naked and walked back to your home city of Sidonia. Many happy returns, we're done here.‶ He stood up and walked out. Sir untied Sophie, and a servant brought a sack. When Sophie was fully untied, Sir got Sophie to lift her arms and the sack was pulled onto her body and tightened. She was led over to us.<br><br>She looked dazed, as if she were convinced she were in some kind of a dream. We lined up together and she took her place, which happened to be next to me. I smiled at her, and recognition seemed to come over her face.<br><br>‶Hello, Sophie.‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 14", summary: "Megan is tickled by another ENF and truly submits.", content: "I tried to grit my teeth. Farrah's fingers running up and down my armpits were agony. But it was no use - her spanks weren't as strong as Sir's, but she didn't need strength to tickle me.<br><br>‶Give in,‶ she said. ‶Give in, Megan!‶<br><br>I felt laughter heaving in my gut. Riley and Simone were so heavy on my arms and legs. Their flesh was so warm against mine.<br><br>‶No! Hohoho! Nooooooo!‶ I cried out.<br><br>Farrah stopped. I looked up her in surprise. So did Riley and Simone.<br><br>‶What's this, babe?‶ asked Riley.<br><br>‶You know you're a bad girl, Megan,‶ said Farrah, looking at me through her big thick glasses and ignoring Riley entirely. ‶Even if you hadn't killed someone. You're naughty. You're mean.‶ She started very gently stroking my armpit with her finger. I shuddered, but I didn't laugh. She was expertly toying with me. ‶Killing someone just sealed the deal permanently. Your only redemption is in giving up.‶<br><br>Then she switched to rapidly tickling me. I shrieked, in surprise as much as because of the tickling, and it turned to helpless laughter. I wriggled helplessly under the bodies of Farrah, Riley, and Simone. Simone was watching us all very carefully; Riley was grinning evilly; Farrah was watching me and my eyes.<br><br>I hollered. I begged for mercy. She didn't stop, she didn't let up. Her fingers on my body were absolute torture. With time, I became desensitised. Unlike Sir, she didn't move her fingers down. I could see her through my tears. It wasn't that it completely stopped tickling - gods help me, it still tickled - but I found I could take it.<br><br>And now I could see what she meant. It's like a wave of relief came over me. I could take my punishment. I could learn to submit completely. It was okay! I was a naughty, mean, small-minded little girl, and I could take that!<br><br>‶Do it!‶ I cried out. ‶Punish me!‶<br><br>She smiled. Her eyes widened. She moved her fingers down to my belly. ‶Someone get her feet!‶<br><br>I tried fighting the writhing. I yelped when Riley started tickling inbetween my toes, but I kept my body as still as possible. My whole body felt so sensitive.<br><br>‶Good girl,‶ whispered Farrah. ‶Good girl.‶ I felt good. I couldn't stop the helpless laughter, but I let her run her fingers over my body, and I let Riley tickle the soles of my feet, and I let Simone start tickling my neck, and I didn't fight it. I submitted. I submitted. It was unbearable, exquisite agony.<br><br>Gradually, Farrah stopped. Simone immediately stopped when she noticed this; it took Riley a few seconds to realise what was happening. Farrah stared down at me, smiling secretively.<br><br>‶Are you done with me, ma'am?‶ I asked, trying to catch my breath.<br><br>‶No. You're so beautiful, Megan,‶ said Farrah. She then leaned down and kissed my lips. She was soft and gentle, much moreso with her lips than her fingers. She started rubbing her pussy against mine and I moaned with pleasure.<br><br>She stared me right in the eyes as she grinded against me. Her expression was determined, steady - not at all feral but controlled. I was her plaything today. I have to admit, it turned me on. This was the next layer of submission. This petite lady was, right now, more powerful than me and was using me... and it felt good to let her take control.<br><br>Riley put my breast in her mouth and started sucking; she had to let go of my arm, and I reached out and stroked her hair. It was soft and short and felt good between my fingers. Simone stroked my face and the touch felt magic. Simone had power over me too and chose to be gentle.<br><br>Farrah leaned down and kissed my face. She planted kisses all over my mouth and chin; so delicate and kind. It was like a reward for submitting. I felt myself edge closer to orgasm, between the grinding, the tit sucking, and the stroking and kissing. It practically became hard to breath - I was gasping for air.<br><br>I wondered if Sir would punish me for this.<br><br>----<br><br>‶So, Sophie. Welcome to Campbell-Taylor.‶<br><br>We were sitting in the eating hall. It was lunchtime, and I knew this was the first real food Sophie had eaten since she had been picked up as an ENF. It was a mixture of rice, peas, corn, mushroom, and some kind of sauce I didn't recognise. She ate it very quickly, relishing the taste.<br><br>‶I didn't think we'd get to eat this well,‶ she said softly.<br><br>‶We're ENFs,‶ I said. ‶We're being punished. It's got to be fair, or it isn't a punishment. Working us is fair. Spanking us is fair. Tickling us is more than fair. Starving us wouldn't be fair.‶<br><br>She looked up at me curiously. ‶How do you know me?‶<br><br>‶It's no wonder you don't remember me - I'm wearing a little more than last time,‶ I beamed. ‶I was chained to a wall with a bunch of other ENFs. You thought I was the most beautiful of them all.‶<br><br>Realisation dawned. ‶That's right!‶<br><br>‶Doesn't quite seem so nice now, does it?‶<br><br>She looked back down at her bowl. ‶In - in retrospect - probably...‶<br><br>I waved my hand. ‶Don't be embarrassed. Or rather, do, I suppose. I brought it on myself just as surely as you did.‶<br><br>Her eyes seemed to light up. ‶That was a couple of years ago. You've been here all this time?‶<br><br>‶Yep. They don't tell you that you'll end up at somewhere like Campbell-Taylor when they make you strip. Used to be, you'd just be taken to the person you wronged, spanked in front of them, and let go. Smaller crimes, that still happens. But now for larger crimes like what you and I committed, we're taken to a place like Campbell-Taylor for a few years.‶<br><br>She covered her face with her hands for a second. ‶We're going to be here forever?‶<br><br>‶Actually, no.‶ I said cheerfully. ‶We're being punished. By definition, punishment can't be cruel. I think the longest anyone has ever been here is seven years. Then a Sir comes, strips you naked, and takes you home.‶<br><br>She rubbed her eye then looked at me. ‶What do we do here?‶<br><br>‶Labour. Peeling potatoes, washing, things like that. If you act up, you get spanked.‶<br><br>‶Oh gods!‶<br><br>‶It's not so bad.‶ I leaned back, feeling wistful. ‶I feel like I've found new meaning in my life here. I'm doing something meaningful and difficult. It feels good to beat the bad and naughty out of myself now. It feels good to be stripped truly naked.‶ I smiled at her confused look. ‶You might get what I mean someday.‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 15", summary: "Megan is taken to the city and put on display.", content: "Sir was leading me through the forest. I had spent the night at the Stable; Riley, Farrah, Simone and I had all spent the night sleeping in a big pile. Their bodies were so warm and comfortable. When Sir came into the Stable and called my name, I bounded for him and turned around so he could tie my arms up. I bent and lifted as he covered me in that strange cream that kept me warm in the elements. I kept quiet as he spoke to the receptionist, looking down to signify I was being good. And now we were walking down the path, as we had many times before.<br><br>And that's when I realised: I was now a well-trained puppy. It felt good! It felt nice that the world had become simple. There were just a few things I had to do. It was the fairness of the situation that I liked about it. Sir would do no more or less than he promised. He wouldn't make up new rules the way Farrah did. He wouldn't push me past my limits unless I kept acting up. As long as I was a good girl, I would not get any more than I deserved.<br><br>As I was thinking about this, we came out onto a vista. I gasped when I saw the city laid out in front of me in a massive valley. It was a city of glittering white, with massive walls surrounding it. I could see the people moving through the streets - and carts, and taxis. I could see the market district, and the business district.<br><br>I wondered how they would react to a well-trained naked woman.<br><br>Sir led me down the mountain. It took us some time, and I was awed by how tall the walls were; they just kept getting bigger and bigger as we approached. It was intimidating to approach something like this naked - I already felt small and weak, and these walls left me feeling even more insignificant.<br><br>Our path joined up with a massive road that was filled with traffic. We passed a few men and women riding horses; they looked at me with amusement, with one woman blowing me a kiss. We also saw carriages carrying whole families, which led to the image of a bunch of faces poking out to watch me.<br><br>I'm sure that, even having accepted my role as an ENF, my face was red.<br><br>We came up to the wall. There was a massive portcullis lifted up to allow traffic in.<br><br>‶Halt, Catcher!‶ cried a voice. ‶Go towards the office to your left, that you may properly register.‶<br><br>‶Understood and well met, friend!‶ cried out Sir. He led me to the side where there was a much smaller portcullis. When it lifted, I saw a large, walled-in area, obviously separate from the rest of the city. There was a building to our lift and a set of stables to our right - horse stables, not a stable for me. Sir climbed off his horse and handed the reins to a young man who took it to the stables. He pulled me into the building.<br><br>It was a large room filled with desks and people working at them. They were writing at them with high speed. One of them looked up at us.<br><br>‶Ah, Catcher. You must have been sent through to us.‶<br><br>‶Indeed I was,‶ said Sir.<br><br>‶It's nice to see a naked woman in these parts,‶ said the man, smiling at me. ‶But I must ask you to hitch her up out that door. How tall is she?‶<br><br>‶Five foot four.‶<br><br>‶You'll need this.‶ The man reached behind his desk and pulled up a stool. He rotated a wheel on the side, extending its height mechanically.<br><br>‶Very well.‶ Sir pulled me through the office to a door on the right. We came out onto a busy city street. Hundreds of people were walking past us! Most of them were dressed in simple togas; some had more elaborate belts and headdresses. Most of them smiled when they saw me, but continued on.<br><br>Sir pulled me next to the door. I could see a series of numbers on the wall - one, two, three, and so on - and under each number was a pair of manacles chained to the wall. About halfway up the wall were little silver circles with a slot under every second one.<br><br>Sir put the stool down under Two. I stood on it and held my arms up.<br><br>‶Ah, good girl, Megan! But you'll have to get up on your toes.‶ I obeyed, and he locked me in the manacles. I saw the point immediately: I would have to stay on my tippy-toes. Sir then put the green pendant around my neck. ‶Remember, not a word.‶<br><br>He went back inside. My eyes wandered out to the street. People were smirking at me. A few pointed. Then a couple walked up to me. My heart fell.<br><br>----<br><br>‶Oof! Nine! Thank you, Chief! Oh! Ten! Thank, you, Chief!‶<br><br>The chief returned his paddle to his belt. ‶Sophie, stand up.‶<br><br>She obeyed. She put her hands behind her back as she turned to face the chief, looking down.<br><br>‶What do you have to say, Sophie?‶<br><br>‶I'm sorry for stealing the bread. It won't happen again.‶<br><br>‶Good girl. Get dressed and go back to work.‶<br><br>I didn't look up from my kneading, but I heard the chief walk out as Sophie pulled her sack back on. ‶I told you not to eat that bread,‶ I said to her.<br><br>‶Oh, shut up,‶ said Sophie.<br><br>‶I would have thought that two years of Campbell-Taylor would beat the disobedience out of you.‶<br><br>‶Fuck you!‶ said Sophie, tears in her eyes. She walked right up into my personal space. Gertrude was standing next to us and looked terrified. ‶You act like you're above all of this! I haven't seen you take a single spanking since you got here! You thrive in a place like this, you weirdo!‶<br><br>I looked at her and I saw things from her perspective. She had only seen the best part of myself, and thought it was an impossible ideal to live up to. She had no reason to believe I had learned to submit - that it was a process one had to go through. So I decided to show her.<br><br>I pushed her onto the ground and started kicking her. Enraged, she started fighting me. I fought back without trying too hard - didn't want to actually hurt her.<br><br>That was when the chief came in.<br><br>‶Hey, hey, hey! Break it up! Both of you, stand!‶<br><br>I practically jumped to my feet. Sophie took a little longer to get up.<br><br>‶Assume the position!‶<br><br>‶Yes, Chief!‶<br><br>----<br><br>It was night. I was naked. I was strapped into a Punishment Cage. It was very much like what I'd been strapped into when I was processed at that Stable so long ago. My feet were manacled to the floor, my hands manacled far above my head. Sophie was strapped into a Punishment Cage right next to me. She was moaning in pain.<br><br>‶How are you holding up over there?‶ I whispered to her.<br><br>‶The fuck do you think? My ass is so sore!‶<br><br>‶I know how you feel. I mean, you did see me take thirty spanks as well. I'm just wondering if you noticed that I took them all without a single complaint.‶ I heard her sniff, but she didn't say anything. ‶I want you to know I knew exactly what was going to happen to us. I knew we were gonna get stripped, I knew we were gonna get spanked, and I knew we were gonna be put in Punishment Cages. I wanted you to see that I can know all of this and still take it with full confidence. I'm strong enough to take my punishment and I know you can as well. Above all, I remember one thing: we deserve this.‶<br><br>‶Maybe. It's an interesting thought.‶<br><br>‶You'll want to get some rest. We're getting tickled in the morning.‶<br><br>‶What?! Oh no!‶" },

See that pendant around her neck? Every word she speaks, a number goes up by two.‶<br><br>I was being studied. The fact that they were so polite about it was what made it so embarrassing. Like I was an artwork on the wall. Let's face it, I basically am.<br><br>‶That's pretty interesting. Look how shy she is. She must know she's being punished pretty badly. Is she up here all the time?‶<br><br>‶No. I don't see her Sir around. Normally an ENF is being led around naked by a man she has to call Sir. He spanks her when she acts out and tickles her in public. Hey, which reminds me - do you want to see something really cool?‶<br><br>‶Yeah!‶<br><br>My heart dropped. What horrible thing was about to happen to me? The man gave the woman a gold coin.<br><br>‶Drop that in the slot next to her. But do not touch her! Trust me, you don't want to see what happens when you do that.‶<br><br>The woman walked right up to me. I wished I could kick her away, but aside from the fact I was awkwardly up on my toes, I knew it would lead to a world of hurt from Sir. I watched her drop the coin in the slot, and then to my horror, I heard a whirring behind me. A pair of mechanical arms emerged from the holes next to me.<br><br>‶Oh nooooooo!‶ I cried. The number on the pendant jumped to four. The hands came to my armpits and started tickling relentlessly. Laughter burst out of me. I felt tears in my eyes. I shifted left and right, unable to really move, eventually doing a little bouncing dance as I tried to bear the endless tickling. My armpits throbbed as I was tickled!<br><br>And that's when I heard laughter. Very familiar laughter.<br><br>‶Megan?! Is that you?‶<br><br>He bounded down the street, almost pushing people out of the way.<br><br>It was Jack.<br><br>He was cackling madly. ‶Are you naked?! Oh my god, you've been caught as an ENF! This is too much!‶ He giggled almost as much as I was, only with mirth instead of humiliation.<br><br>I felt my face burning with shame. Just when I thought I couldn't sink any lower! This was the worst of the shame yet. I felt it on my very shoulders. I started crying between the giggling - not from the tickling, but at my former friend, who I had bullied so many people with, roaring with laughter at my naked tickled public humiliation.<br><br>And then the tears began to subside. There were no more left. My eyes and face were burning and the shame never passed, but I processed it. I saw Sir come out and look at me.<br><br>‶Are you this woman's Sir?‶ asked the man.<br><br>‶I am indeed,‶ said Sir. He politely waited for the tickling machine to end. Mercifully, I felt the arms move back and into their slots. Sir climbed up and unshackled me. He looked at my pendant.<br><br>‶Megan, you have four spanks marked on your pendant. Lay across my lap so I can spank you.‶<br><br>He sat down on the stool. The man, the woman, and Jack watched expectantly, the latter with evil glee. I was being punished, so I obeyed.<br><br>‶Oh gods! She's actually doing it!‶ chortled Jack. Sir brought his hand down on my butt.<br><br>‶One! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I deserve this.<br><br>‶Two! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>I don't know if this will be my lowest point.<br><br>‶Three! Ohhhh! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>Naked, tickled, and spanked in front of Jack.<br><br>‶Four! Arrgh! Thank you, Sir!‶<br><br>But I'm willing to find it. To be degraded until I'm cleansed. Forgiven. Good.<br><br>‶Stand up, Megan.‶<br><br>I did. I put my hands behind my back expectantly.<br><br>‶Good girl,‶ says Sir as he ties my wrists together. He put a leash around my neck and walked me down the street. I heard the laughter of Jack ringing through my ears as we walked deeper into the city.<br><br>Sir led me to a large, ancient-looking building. Gargoyles are scattered across the top. It's an intimidating building - I feel even smaller and weaker in its presence as it reaches into the sky. Written in large letters over the top of the door are the words CAMPBELL-TAYLOR. Sir takes me in.<br><br>I am an embarrassed naked female. I am being punished. I am being tickled. I am being spanked. I am naked for all to see. And I am ready for what's next.<br><br>----<br><br>I'm standing in the kitchen of Campbell-Taylor, kneading dough with Gertrude, Sophie, and about a half-dozen other ENFs. The Chief comes in the room.<br><br>‶Megan Bandini!‶<br><br>I turn, standing straight, arms behind my back.<br><br>‶Yes, Chief!‶<br><br>‶In one week, your sentence will be up. Sir will come and collect you. You'll come into the grand hall for the meeting, take off your sack, and be tied up and led home. Understand?‶<br><br>My heart races. ‶I understand, Chief!‶<br><br>‶Back to work.‶ The Chief leaves, and I turn straight back to the dough and return to kneading.<br><br>‶That's it?!‶ said Gertrude. ‶You're out of here?‶<br><br>‶I guess that's it. Wow. Where does the time go?‶<br><br>I'm genuinely shocked. Campbell-Taylor has been my home for so long. I've gotten so much good work done here. I almost don't know how I feel.<br><br>----<br><br>It's lunch, the same day. We're in teh breakfast hall, eating soup. I'm still dumbstruck.<br><br>‶How am I going to handle you gone?‶ asked Sophie. ‶We'vbe become such good friends over the years! Ever since we spent the night together in the Punishment Cage, remember that?‶<br><br>‶How could I forget?‶ I asked, not really listening. I was distracted by a nearby table, where an ENF was refusing to eat. She was a little blonde woman, very petite, her hair tied back in a ponytail. I could see her temper boiling over as her friends were trying to talk to her.<br><br>‶No!‶ cried the girl. She picked up her bowl and threw it on the floor. Some guards came around and grabbed her, and she started shrieking and crying. ‶It's not fair! It's not fair!‶ A guard pulled off her sack, leaving her stark naked. Another pair pulled her to her knees, and the first started spanking her across the butt. ‶it's not faaaaaaaiiiiiiiir!‶ she cried, writhing in the guards' arms as her friends kept telling her to count the spanks.<br><br>What a silly girl. It was entirely fair. She did something wrong and now she was being punished. That's how it works. If I were in her position, I would simply take the spanks.<br><br>It made me think about what was going to happen.<br><br>----<br><br>The day came.<br><br>I was in the great hall. We were all lined up - all us ENFs of Campbell-Taylor - and the guards were lined up behind us. The prince entered the room and sat on his throne, bored out of his mind.<br><br>‶Megan Bandini. Step forward.‶<br><br>I obeyed. I could take my punishment like a good girl.<br><br>‶Take off your clothes.‶<br><br>In one movement, I pulled my sack off, folded it, and put it on the floor in front of me. I was now nude. My hands by my side, no attempt to cover up. I don't deserve clothes yet.<br><br>‶Turn and face the door.‶<br><br>I turned and faced the door. Only when told. I am obediant. I will be good.<br><br>The doors opened. Inw alked a man. I wasn't sure if I was disappointed - it wasn't the same man who brought me here. No, put that aside. You don't get to decide how you're punished. Besides, this is a fresh start with a new Sir. Show him from the start you're a good girl.<br><br>He walks up to and around me, pulls out a rope and ties my wrists together. He puts a leash over my head and around my neck. He leads me out. I walk.<br><br>My name is Megan Bandini. I am being punished. I will be walked naked through the streets for all to see. I will be publicly tickled. I will do everything Sir asks of me. Only then will I be a good girl.<br><br>====<br><br>Author's Note: I'm willing to admit that not everything about this story worked. The idea of telling an ENF story out of chronological order was overly clever for a number of reasons. My thought was that it would enhance thigns by humanising Megan, but it only served to undermine the tone and pacing; we'd get somewhere really intense with her humiliation, only for a flashback to undercut the feeling. It only really started working when we saw two spankings intercut, and I feel the flashforwards were really nifty. But let's face it, we didn't really need much time to figure out Megan deserved to be an ENF.<br><br>I also feel that I should have made the overall tone less dependent on you having read the first one. It quickly became clear many more people read The ENF Catcher than the Firebug series and may not have had the grounding necessary to understand what they were seeing. While I feel the story overall works - I always managed to ground myself in the erotic pleasures of an embarrassed naked woman - I feel I overcomplicated things for myself enormously. If nothing else, I kept losing inspiration and getting lost as to where the story should go!<br><br>----" }
