            <p>The night was cold, the stars a dim constellation above, as Akane slipped through the shadows of the castle grounds. The mission was straightforward: infiltrate the castle, retrieve the ancient scroll, and return before dawn. Easy enough for a seasoned kunoichi like herself—or so she had thought. But as she approached the imposing walls, a knot tightened in her stomach, a reminder of past failures and the ever-looming rivalry with Kumi.<br><br>The guards were all women, a well-trained contingent of the Emperor's personal guard. Skilled, lethal, and unyielding, they moved with the precision of dancers, each patrol a synchronized movement that made her nervous. rumors of their ferocity had reached her ears, and Akane knew better than to underestimate them. They were the castle's first line of defense, and she was just one kunoichi against their relentless might.<br><br>She moved like a whisper, her sandals silent against the gravel path. Each step was calculated, avoiding sensors and patrols with the grace of a shadow. The castle, with its labyrinthine corridors, seemed to mock her, but Akane pressed on, her heart pounding in her chest, as she navigated through the maze of rooms.<br><br>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Akane reached the inner chamber. The scroll lay in the center, its aged surface glowing faintly under the dim light of a single candle. Relief washed over her, but it was fleeting.<br><br>"Finally! You're mine," she whispered, her hand reaching for the scroll.<br><br>But before her fingers could touch it, a voice pierced the silence, sharp and sassy.<br><br>"Not so fast, sweetie."<br><br>Akane froze, her heart leaping to her throat. She knew that voice—the voice of her rival, Kumi. A surge of adrenaline mixed with annoyance coursed through her veins.<br><br>"Kumi?!" Akane's voice trembled with a mix of anger and disbelief. "What are you doing here? I thought they sent you to Ryujin Island."<br><br>Kumi sauntered into the room, her movements deliberate, her face a mask of polite curiosity. Her traditional kimono swayed with each step, her long black hair tied in a perfect braid. But Akane saw through the facade. Kumi was a master manipulator, and this was just another opportunity to toy with her.<br><br>"It seems my information was spot on," Kumi purred, her voice laced with mockery. "Your clan came for the scroll of ancient power, but alas, it's mine now."<br><br>Akane's eyes narrowed. "You can forget about that!" With a swift move, she threw a set of kunais toward Kumi, and a fierce combat ensued. Both kunoichi clashed with impressive skill, their movements a blur as they swung blows and evaded them with great speed.<br><br>"I see you've improved," Kumi taunted, her eyes glinting with amusement. "But you still have a lot to learn."<br><br>Akane landed a kick, but Kumi disappeared with a swift substitution technique. The room seemed to shift and twist around Akane, and before she knew it, she was ensnared in a complex web of ninja traps and seals. The ropes tightened as she struggled, panic rising to the surface.<br><br>"Careful where you step, Akane," Kumi said, her voice dripping with mock concern. "You know how unpredictable these traps can be." As Akane struggled, her kimono slipped off her shoulder, exposing a hint of her underwear. Kumi's eyes sparkled with amusement, and she took a step closer, her gaze fixed on Akane's partially exposed skin.<br><br>"Oh my, that was totally unexpected," Kumi purred, her voice laced with sarcasm.<br><br>"You asshole! You carefully designed this trap, didn't you?" Akane spat, her face burning with anger and embarrassment.<br><br>Desperation surged through Akane as her struggles only tightened the ropes. With a final, desperate tug, the last trap was triggered, and her clothes were stripped away, leaving her stark naked. The cool air caressed her skin, and she felt a wave of mortification wash over her.<br><br>Kumi's smile grew wider as she gazed at Akane's nude form. "I wouldn't move so much if I were you," she said, her voice dripping with condescension. "But don't worry, the samurai girls will take care of you." With a flourish, Kumi snatched the scroll and pressed a mocking kiss to Akane's left cheek.<br><br>Embarrassment and frustration seared through Akane's veins, but she refused to let Kumi see her falter. She bit back a retort, her eyes blazing with anger and humiliation.<br><br>"Looks like someone's having a bad night," Kumi said, her voice oozing with smug satisfaction as she circled Akane like a predator. "But don't worry, I'm sure your clan will pay your ransom... eventually." Kumi's gaze lingered on Akane's naked form, and Akane felt a surge of discomfort under her scrutiny.<br><br>With that, Kumi vanished into the shadows, leaving Akane bound and humiliated. The alarm bells began to sound, their shrill tones reverberating through the castle walls. Akane gulped, her mind racing. The samurai girls were notorious for their ruthless treatment of kunoichi, and she knew she was in for a world of embarrassment and humiliation. This was going to be a long, long day.<br><br>----------------<br><br>Akane's master was furious, her face a thunderstorm of rage. The woman pacing back and forth in her office was like a volcano on the verge of eruption, her eyes blazing with a fierce intensity. Akane had never seen her master this angry before, and she felt a shiver run down her spine as she stood before her.<br><br>"Explain yourself!" the master barked, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. "How could you make such a reckless mistake? You've brought shame to the Shoukouin Clan, and now the entire ninja world is laughing at us—again!"<br><br>Akane flinched, her pride stinging like a wound. "Master, I—"<br><br>"Is this about your little crush on the samurai guards?" the master interrupted, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Because that's the only excuse I can think of for someone as skilled as you getting caught like that!" The master's words cut deep, and Akane felt her face burn with embarrassment.

"No! That's not it!" Akane snapped, her voice rising in defense.<br><br>The master's expression turned glacial as she held up a newspaper scroll. The traditional drawings depicted a naked kunoichi with green hair being spanked publicly by a group of samurai girls. Akane's eyes widened in horror as she realized the extent of her humiliation.<br><br>"It was Kumi! She ambushed me!" Akane exclaimed, her hands clenched into fists.<br><br>The master's expression changed from anger to surprise, her eyes narrowing like a predator's. "Kumi? You're blaming this on Kumi? She's been sent to the Ryujin Islands, and even if she had escaped, it's impossible for her to be back already."<br><br>Akane stood her ground, her voice firm. "I'm telling you, Master, it was Kumi! She's back, and she ambushed me. I didn't see her coming, and before I knew it, the samurai were—"<br><br>The master's anger seemed to dissipate, replaced by a calculating glint in her eye. If Kumi was indeed back, it changed everything. The master's expression turned thoughtful, and she nodded slowly.<br><br>"Okay... I get it. But still, your failure has brought great shame to our clan. Maybe if your sneaking skills weren't so sloppy, Kumi wouldn't have ever seen you." The master's voice was stern, but Akane detected a hint of disappointment rather than anger. "That's it! You'll do the Daring Daisy training!"<br><br>Akane's eyes widened in alarm. "Daring Daisy?" she repeated.


----------------------<br><br>The night air was cool and crisp, with a crescent moon casting a silvery glow over the village. Akane stood in her master's office, her hands clutching her shinobi uniform tightly. The fabric felt foreign against her skin now, and the thought of venturing out into the village in her underwear was almost too much to bear. Her master had been relentless, insisting on this unconventional method of training, and Akane was determined to make the best of it - but that didn't mean she had to like it.<br><br>"This is stupid," she muttered under her breath, her frustration evident. Her voice was quiet, but the words were loaded with resentment. She glanced up at her master, who stood by the window, arms crossed, displaying an unwavering resolve. Akane's gaze locked with hers, and for a moment, she considered arguing further - but the master's steady stare made it clear there was no point in fighting it.<br><br>"No complaints, Akane," her master retorted, her voice firm. "This is the way. The Daring Daisy training is a traditional method for kunoichi, designed to test your skills in stealth and cunning. You will need to retrieve three pendants, each hidden in a different location, before dawn breaks."<br><br>Akane's eyes widened as she listened, her mind racing with the challenge ahead. "The first pendant is hidden at the ninja academy training grounds," her master explained. "The second is at the men's hot springs, and the third is at the marketplace. Each location is treacherous, especially for a kunoichi in...ahem...limited attire."<br><br>Akane felt a surge of embarrassment, but her master continued, unfazed. "You will need to use all your skills to sneak past the guards and retrieve the pendants without being seen. The training grounds are usually less crowded at night, but the guards at the hot springs and marketplace will be more vigilant. You will need to be quick and clever if you hope to succeed."<br><br>Akane clenched her jaw, her pride stinging with embarrassment. She knew better than to argue further. She needed to prove herself, and this was her chance. But the thought of venturing out like this...it was humiliating, and she couldn't shake the feeling that her master was as much to blame for her predicament as anyone.<br><br>"All right," she said through gritted teeth, her voice barely above a whisper. "Let's get this over with."<br><br>She quickly undressed, her fingers fumbling with the tight fabric of her undergarments. They were traditional, practical, but that didn't stop them from feeling impossibly revealing in the quiet darkness of the office. Her long, green hair seemed to glow faintly under the dim light of the window, and she couldn't help but feel a shiver run down her spine as the cool night air began to seep into the room.<br><br>"Come on," her master said, breaking the silence. "Time is running out. The clock is ticking."<br><br>Akane was nervous, feeling openly exposed standing in her underwear at her master's office. "Okay, off you go," her master said, pushing her out of the office window.<br><br>Akane landed gracefully on the ground below, her naked body trembling in the crisp chill. The moonlight illuminated the village streets, casting long shadows that seemed to watch her every move. Akane stood there for a moment, her breath visible in the frosty air, as the weight of her mission settled over her like a heavy cloak.<br><br>She pulled the map out of her undies, her fingers trembling slightly as she unfolded it. Her eyes scanned the locations marked in faint ink: the men's hot springs, the ninja academy training grounds, and the marketplace. All three spots were precarious, even more so because she was practically nude. But she didn't have a choice. She had to prove herself, no matter how humiliating this was.<br><br>"My first stop should be the training grounds," she muttered to herself, her voice barely audible over the rustling leaves. "It's less crowded, and the guards there are usually lax at night. The hot springs can wait until later."<br><br>With a deep breath, Akane took off into the night, her senses heightened. The village was eerily quiet, save for the occasional howl of the wind and the distant chatter of night owls. Every shadow made her jump, every sound made her heart race. She moved like a shadow, blending into the darkness as best she could, but the feeling of exposure was overwhelming.


-----------<br><br>The night air was cool and crisp, with a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the training grounds. Akane crouched behind a tree, her heart pounding in her chest as she clutched the map tightly. Her nerves were frayed, and the knowledge that she was barely clad added to her unease. She couldn't believe she was in this situation, forced to sneak around in her underwear to retrieve the pendant.

As she peered through the foliage, she overheard a group of male ninja trainees chatting nearby. Their voices were laced with mockery, and Akane's face turned crimson as she recognized the topic of their conversation.<br><br>"Have you heard about Akane?" one of them asked, his voice tinged with amusement. "She got caught by the Emperor's guard. They really did a number on her."<br><br>Akane's hands tightened into fists as she listened to their conversation. The trainees' words cut deep, and she felt a surge of embarrassment and anger.<br><br>"It's bad for the clan's reputation," one of them noted.<br><br>"But I'd love to be there to see that," another trainee swooned. "Damn right, dude! She's such a beauty."<br><br>A young kunoichi, Taki, chimed in, her voice dripping with confidence. "What's so special about that old greenhead? I'm so much sexier and skilled than her!"<br><br>Akane's eyes narrowed as she listened to Taki's boasts. She had heard of the young kunoichi's ego, but she had never met her before.<br><br>"I wouldn't underestimate Akane... she's a real cool senpai," one of the trainees said, defending Akane.<br><br>Taki snorted. "Whatever, I bet she's just an old lady by now!"<br><br>Akane chose to ignore their banter, her focus on the task at hand. She scanned the area, her breath coming in shallow gasps, until she spotted a shimmer of light catching the moonlight on a distant tree branch. The pendant was within her grasp, but she needed to stay unnoticed.<br><br>Just as she was about to move, a loud, cocky voice interrupted the silence. "Looking for this?" Taki dangled the pendant before Akane, a smug look on her face.<br><br>The trainees turned to see the commotion, their eyes widening in recognition. "Did you say something, Taki?" one exclaimed.<br><br>Akane's eyes locked onto Taki, her face burning with embarrassment. "Shut up!" she whispered.

Taki smirked. "Oh, it's nothing, I think I just saw a cute cat."<br><br>Akane's anger simmered just below the surface. "What do you want?" she demanded.<br><br>Taki's confidence brimming, she taunted, "I'm surprised, it seems you really are a pervert after all. You got caught by the Emperor's guard, they really got you good, didn't they? Now you can't even keep your clothes on..."<br><br>Akane's cheeks flamed with embarrassment, and she clenched her fists harder. "Watch it, trainee," she warned, her voice trembling slightly. "There's a big difference between our skills."<br><br>Taki's smirk grew wider. "Big gap, huh? Let's see if you can back that up." She flicked her wrist, and the pendant swung mockingly in Akane's direction.<br><br>Akane's eyes narrowed. She wasn't about to let this trainee ruin her day any further. With a swift movement, she charged towards Taki, her fists flying in a flurry of punches and kicks.<br><br>Taki, confident in her own abilities, met Akane's attack head-on. For a moment, it seemed like the younger kunoichi was gaining the upper hand, landing a few good hits and sending Akane stumbling back. Taki's grin grew wider, and she taunted Akane, "You're not as good as I thought you'd be!"<br><br>But Akane was just playing a waiting game. She had been holding back, assessing Taki's skills and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And when she did, it was with lightning-fast speed and precision. Taki found herself on the defensive, struggling to keep up with Akane's rapid-fire punches and kicks.<br><br>"Gasp... you know a trick or two," she admitted, between gasps. "But this pendant is still mine!"<br><br>Akane smiled, a mischievous glint in her eye. "You mean this?" she said, holding up the pendant. As she did, Taki's clothes suddenly ripped apart, leaving her exposed and shocked.<br><br>"H-how?" Taki stuttered, her eyes wide with surprise and embarrassment. She frantically tried to cover herself with her hands, but it was too late. The damage was done, and she was left standing there, humiliated and naked.<br><br>Akane just chuckled, a triumphant smile on her face. "I think I've made my point," she said, with a hint of satisfaction. And with that, she turned and walked away, leaving Taki to her embarrassment and shame.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Akane took a deep breath, gathered her courage, and jumped over the wall, landing silently in the hot spring. She slipped into the water like a leaf, making barely a ripple. Great, nobody saw her. She was in the women's side, and she knew she had to move quickly if she was going to sneak into the men's side.<br><br>As she looked around, she noticed a woman sitting on the edge of the hot spring, watching her with a friendly smile. The woman was naked, with a towel draped over her shoulders, and Akane felt a surge of embarrassment.<br><br>"Oh dear, you're not supposed to bathe with your undies," the woman said, nodding towards Akane's underwear. "You have to leave them in the dressing room."<br><br>Akane knew this, of course, but she was hesitant to abandon her only set of available clothes. She clung to them, trying to think of a way to sneak into the men's side without having to strip completely. She also knew she wasn't supposed to be there in the first place - she had snuck in without paying, and she didn't have any money on her.<br><br>"It's okay... I don't..." Akane started to say, trying to come up with an excuse.<br><br>But the woman just laughed and said, "Oh, don't worry, don't be shy! It's just girls here!" She smiled and patted the water beside her. "Come on, join us! We don't bite."<br><br>Akane felt a surge of embarrassment and frustration. She knew she wasn't going to win this debate, and she felt forced to strip out of her undies. She reluctantly got out of the water and walked over to a nearby basket, where she deposited her undies. She felt a pang of anxiety as she left her only piece of clothing behind, but she knew she had to keep moving.<br><br>She took a deep breath and slipped back into the hot water, trying to get used to the feeling of being naked. As she looked around, she remembered a small gap between the rocks that she had noticed earlier. It was just big enough for her to swim through, and she thought it might be her ticket to sneaking into the men's side.<br><br>She waited until the woman who had spoken to her was distracted, then she slipped away, using the mist rising from the hot spring as cover. She swam quietly towards the gap, her heart pounding in her chest. As she slipped through the narrow opening, she felt a rush of excitement and fear. She was one step closer to her goal, but she was also completely naked and vulnerable. She hoped that the mist would continue to hide her as she made her way into the men's side.<br><br>As Akane swam through the narrow gap, she emerged on the other side, her heart racing with anticipation. She looked around, trying to get her bearings, and that's when she saw them. A group of men, all naked and lounging on the edge of the hot spring, laughing and joking with each other. They were all holding cups of sake, and their eyes were glassy from drinking.<br><br>One of them spotted Akane, and his eyes lit up with excitement. "Hey, look what we've got here!" he exclaimed, pointing at Akane. The other men turned to look, and they all burst out laughing.<br><br>Crap, her sneaking plan wasn't so well thought out... Akane's face burned with shame as she realized she was the center of attention. She tried to cover herself with her hands, and gave a playful smile back at the guys. "H-hey..." The men were all staring at her, making lewd comments and jokes.

One of them, a tall and muscular guy, stood up and started walking towards her. "Hey, little girl, what brings you to our side of the hot spring?" he asked, his voice slurred from drinking.<br><br>Akane tried to ignore him and his... but he just kept coming, his eyes fixed on her body. "Hey, you're a pretty one, aren't you?" he said, reaching out to touch her hair.<br><br>Akane flinched, trying to move away, but the man just laughed. "Oh, come on, don't be shy," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "We're all friends here."<br><br>Akane decided to play along, hoping to get what she wanted. "You mean it? Would you guys help me?" she asked, trying to sound innocent.<br><br>The men all cheered and clapped, and one of them said, "Of course, of course... what does the little siren need?"<br><br>Akane took a deep breath and said, "I'm looking for a pendant..."<br><br>One of the men, an older guy with a sly grin, said, "I think I saw something... but my memory isn't what it used to be..." He winked at Akane and said, "Maybe a bit of young power would help me remember..."<br><br>Akane's face turned bright red as she realized what the man was insinuating. But she was determined to get the pendant, so she smiled and said, "Gasp... men..." She got herself out of the water and struck a sexy pose, au naturel, for the guys. They all went wild, cheering and whistling.

One of the men pointed at the pendant, which was hanging from a rock. "Woah, lady! That's it, I know it! That's the thing!"<br><br>Akane's heart sank as she realized she had to climb the rock naked and do a free show for the guys. But she steeled herself and started to climb, her face burning with embarrassment.

As she reached the top and grabbed the pendant, the men all cheered and clapped. "Wooo, girl! That's how you do it!" one of them shouted.<br><br>But one of the guys got a little too excited and tried to touch her. Akane, with a swift move, sent him flying into the water. "Okay, guys, you had your fun, now don't play with fire or you'll get burned," she said, her eyes flashing with warning.<br><br>The men all laughed and cheered, and Akane took advantage of the distraction to make her escape. She climbed back down the rock and slipped back into the water, pendant in hand. She swam back through the narrow gap, emerging on the other side, gasping with relief.<br><br>As she emerged from the hot spring, Akane quickly made her way back to the women's side, her heart still racing from her ordeal. She searched the area, her eyes scanning the baskets and towels, until she spotted her own basket. She rushed over to it, her hands shaking slightly as she lifted the lid.<br><br>To her relief, her undies were still there, neatly folded and waiting for her. She let out a sigh of relief as she quickly put them back on, feeling her modesty return to her, well, mostly. She smoothed out her hair, trying to compose herself after the embarrassing encounter with the men.<br><br>With a swift jump, she launched herself out of the hot spring, landing neatly on the ground. She didn't look back, not wanting to catch a glimpse of the men's side or the group of rowdy men.<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>The market area was finally empty, not a soul on the streets. Akane thought to herself, "This should be easy enough." She had been searching for the last pendant for what felt like hours, and she was starting to get frustrated. Every alleyway and storefront she checked seemed to yield nothing.<br><br>Just as she was about to give up, a familiar voice called out to her. "Looking for this, sweetheart?" Akane turned to see Kumi standing in front of her, a sly grin spreading across her face. In her hand, she held the last pendant.<br><br>Akane's eyes widened in surprise, and she felt a surge of anger. "Kumi?! You again?! What are you doing in this village?!" she demanded.<br><br>Kumi chuckled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "Just confirming my master's hypothesis. She told me you were going to be running around town butt naked... but it seems she was mostly right." Akane's face burned with embarrassment as she realized that Kumi must have been watching her earlier.<br><br>"I'll get my revenge on you!" Akane shouted, charging at Kumi with a fierce determination. The two women clashed, their skills almost evenly matched. They exchanged blow for blow, their movements lightning-fast as they danced across the empty market streets.<br><br>As they fought, Kumi suddenly held up Akane's underwear, teasing her with them. "Now, I said my master got it wrong, but now she's right," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. Akane felt a surge of shock and embarrassment as she realized that Kumi had somehow managed to strip her during their fight.<br><br>Feeling the night cold on her nude body, Akane shivered and blushed. "You! When did you?" she stuttered, trying to cover herself with her hands.<br><br>Kumi just laughed, her eyes glinting with mischief. "Strip you? Girl, you were asking for it." With a flick of her wrist, she sent Akane's underwear flying into the air, where they landed with a soft flutter on a nearby rooftop.<br><br>Akane's face burned with rage and embarrassment as she launched herself at Kumi, determined to get her revenge. But as she fought, she was constantly aware of her naked body, and she used one or both of her hands to cover herself with every move. She punched and kicked, her hands darting back and forth to cover her breasts and groin.<br><br>Kumi laughed at this, her eyes glinting with amusement. "You're so cute when you're trying to be modest," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "But let's be real, I've already seen everything. You don't have to bother covering up."<br><br>Despite Kumi's teasing, Akane continued to fight, her movements becoming more and more desperate. But it was clear that Kumi was the superior fighter, and the battle was quickly becoming one-sided. Akane stumbled and staggered, her blows becoming weaker and more erratic.<br><br>As the fight dragged on, the sun began to rise, casting a pale light over the market streets. Akane was gasping for air, her body tired and sore. Kumi, on the other hand, seemed to be barely breaking a sweat.<br><br>"Come on, Akane, just give up," Kumi said, her voice dripping with condescension. "I promise I won't humiliate you... much. You're clearly outmatched, and it's only a matter of time before I win."

Akane's face twisted with exhaustion and frustration, but she refused to give up. With a sudden burst of energy, she stood up straight and said, "Yeah, but I still have this!"<br><br>And with that, she "uncovered herself" and "flashed" Kumi, who looked at her with surprise and amusement. "That was it? That was your last technique? Showing me your...?" Kumi trailed off, her voice dripping with sarcasm.<br><br>But as she looked at Akane, she noticed that her surroundings were starting to glow. And then she saw it - Akane's hands were covered in seals, intricate patterns of magic that had been hidden from view until now.<br><br>Kumi's eyes widened in surprise, and she took a step back, her eyes fixed on Akane's hands. "You sneaky...,"<br><br>As the flash of light faded, Kumi found herself trapped and naked, suspended in mid-air in the middle of the main street of the market. She looked around, her eyes wide with horror, as she realized that she was completely exposed and helpless.<br><br>The first few people to arrive at the market couldn't help but stare at Kumi's naked body, their faces a mixture of shock and amusement. Kumi's face turned bright red with rage and embarrassment as she realized that she was going to be the main attraction for the entire market.<br><br>"You asshole! Get me down!" Kumi screamed, her voice echoing off the buildings.<br><br>Akane, still stark naked herself, knelt down beside Kumi and reached out to take the last pendant from her. "No, I don't think so," she said, a triumphant smile spreading across her face.<br><br>Kumi's eyes blazed with fury as Akane took the pendant and held it up, admiring it in the morning light. "Hope you have a great day," Akane said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Those seals will last for 8 hours. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy the attention."<br><br>Kumi's face turned an even deeper shade of red as she realized the full extent of her humiliation. "Noooooooooo! Take me out! You can't do this!" she screamed, her voice hoarse from shouting.

But Akane just laughed and stood up, the pendant held tightly in her hand. She turned and walked away, leaving Kumi to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Akane arrived at her master's office, stark naked but triumphant, the pendants clutched in her hand. She burst through the door, a huge grin on her face. "Master, Master, I did it! I got the pendants!" she exclaimed, waving the pendants in the air.<br><br>Her master looked up from the papers on her desk, a hint of surprise on her face. She took in Akane's naked form, her eyes scanning her from head to toe. "Why are you naked?" she asked, her voice neutral.<br><br>Akane's face turned bright red as she realized her mistake. She let out a little "eep" and tried to cover herself with her hands, but it was too late. Her master had already seen everything.<br><br>"I-um, I..." Akane stuttered, trying to come up with an excuse.<br><br>But her master just shook her head. "You had time to do it till dawn, it's already too late," she said, her voice firm. She stood up and walked over to the door, closing it in Akane's face.<br><br>Akane was left standing outside, butt naked, as her master's voice came from the other side of the door. "You mean I've failed?! But that can't be, I got the pendants... I" Akane protested, but her master just cut her off.<br><br>"Girl, you can try again next Saturday. Now, better go home now, you're attracting... attention," her master said, her voice dripping with amusement.<br><br>Akane looked around, realizing that people were starting to stare at her. She quickly covered herself with her hands and let out a mortified "eep!" as she made a quick jump to the side, using her agility to propel herself out of sight. She disappeared from view, leaving behind a trail of snickers and whispered comments from the gathering crowd.</p>
