      1: `<h2>Legends of the Fel - Prelude</h2><p>IN THE PALACE OF THE GODS (atop Mount Venusia)<br><br>The Queen of the Gods had been treating her two lovers, the demi-goddesses Herena and Hastashia, to a hot golden shower over their lusciously formed bare tits when she had received her summons from her lord and master.<br><br>'Would you like a sample?' she offered Lermes, the winged messenger who was smaller than most of her cousins yet still commanded a body built for all manner of sins, her pert breasts playing host to a very erect set of nipples as she stared somewhat abashed at her mistresses' hairless crotch. It was obvious that she been aroused by the display of brazen pissing.<br><br>'My lady,' she said, her eyes suddenly locked on the floor as she dropped to her knees. For Lera, it was an offer too good to miss. She strode over the resplendently polished marble floor to bring her bare pussy slit to within inches of the messenger's long golden locks. She giggled as she let loose with a new flowing stream of piss, spraying her hot relief directly into the kneeling goddess' hair.<br><br>'Give me your message,' she commanded, still pissing over the blond strands that were now awash with pee. Herena and Hastashia arose from the bed where they had been fornicating with the queen and casually sauntered over to enjoy the spectacle. Lermes had never been over liked due to her propensity for bringing bad news. Thus, Herena decided it was too good an opportunity to miss, moving to the queen's side before directing a stream of her own hot flowing pee to splatter over the kneeling goddess.<br><br>'That looks like so much fun,' said the red-headed Hastashia, the clump of wiry pubic hairs nestled between her legs hiding her slit from sight.<br><br>'Oh it is,' assured the queen. Her hot stream was still flowing copiously from her parted pussy lips.<br><br>'Then I best join in,' said Hastashia and with that started to also relieve herself over the kneeling goddess. Now there were three hot flowing urine streams spraying over the hapless Lermes, who was doing her best not to squirm and twist away from the deluge. She looked thoroughly miserable, her robes soaked to the point of transparency.<br><br>'I want you to taste my pee before you give me your message,' instructed the queen. Her capacity to urinate far outweighed any mortals. Lermes nodded miserably before raising her head to sample her queen's clear coloured urine.<br><br>'Not just mine,' the queen said with satisfaction as Lermes gulped down her hot pee. Unable to disobey Lermes turned to first the raven headed Herena to drink from her pissing pussy before finishing with her lips practically touching the fiery hairs of Hastashia's muff. She opened her mouth to receive a third helping of divine urine.<br><br>'That was enjoyable,' said Lera, stepping back from her toilet stance above the piss soaked goddess, her leak done. Herena had also finished but it seemed that the coppery haired Hastashia was enjoying herself too much to cease peeing.<br><br>'That will be enough,' said the Queen of the Gods. Her voice was laced with a measure of authority that was not to be challenged. Hastashia compiled, meekly lowering her head as she finished her leak with one quick squirt from her pussy hole, spraying the piss-sodden messenger with a final hot jet of pee.<br><br>'Now what is your message?' asked the queen, not able to hide the mirth in her voice. Lermes was the smallest of the divine yet twice the size of any human. She was disliked greatly, the small wings sprouting from her ankles making her a freak amongst her brethren.<br><br>'Our master, Lord Zayeon, King of the Gods, demands your presence at once.'<br><br>Lera felt a chill steel away her merriment. With a word of power she vanished from her chambers, reappearing in the throne room where Zayeon was indeed waiting, his sculptured body a thing of utter perfection as though carved from ivory. He was naked and Lera was forced to avert her eyes away from his massive cock that he was stroking absentmindedly, its girth half erect, a matter that suddenly changed as he took in the sight of her naked body. Like her lord and also husband, Lera was the pinnacle of divine achievement, mankind created as a far weaker imitation. Her nipples were hard on her sumptuous breasts, the firm and muscular tones of her creamy belly running down to the deep slit nestled between her slender and powerful legs.<br><br>A small pop of displaced air announced the arrival of the piss sodden Lermes. She shook her bond strands from side to side to send droplets of pee to stain the frescoed floor that depicted how the gods had created the living world below Mount Venusia.<br><br>'I see that you have been having fun at somebody else's expense,' said Zayeon with a voice that rumbled with a promise of thunder. His disapproval was obvious yet there were matters at hand that would stay his rage. 'There is a disturbance in the ether,' he said, the very floor shaking with the power of his voice. 'Something is coming, something linked to those we thought banished. I need to know when they will arrive and you know what is required.'<br><br>'Yes, my lord,' answered Lera, turning about on the spot before striding away to where a large marble basin shaped like a clam sat on a pedestal of purest gold. She rounded it before moving to face her husband where he remained seated upon his carved throne that had been fashioned as a massive hand rising from the polished floor, its open palm providing a seat for the most illustrious of all beings.<br><br>Zayeon was staring expectantly at her pussy slit, waiting for the moment when she would start to pee for the basin required filling if it was to reveal sights of things to come. After several moments a small clear stream of hot piss began to flow from the queen's open pee hole, jetting away from her lower lips and spraying into the clam shaped bowl. Unfortunately, her toilet shower latest mere moments with nothing but a small pool of piss to show her efforts.<br><br>'I take it that you spent your flow elsewhere?' demanded Zayeon.<br><br>'Yes, my lord,' answered Lera meekly with a quick glance to where the piss soaked Messenger remained with her gaze set on the frescoed floor. 'Maybe she should help?' she suggested.<br><br>The King of the Gods gave Lermes a quick disapproving glance before replying. 'I think not. We need the piss of our purest if we are to divine the future. Quickly, send for all of the immortal females. I want to see them filling that bowl and when they are done we will see what we shall see.' He motioned for Lermes to depart before beckoning for his queen to draw closer. His gaze was set on her naked form, admiring the sway of her naked hips and the presented show on hand; from her proud and erect nipples on her perfectly curving breasts, to the slit of her pussy that just moments ago had been releasing a stream of hot pee.<br><br>As Lera neared the throne she moved to squat down, straddling Zayeon's feet as she moved her mouth and tongue into position to caress his rock hard dick that had lengthened considerably since her piss into the clam bowl. He moaned with pleasure even as he let loose with a squirt of piss into her mouth. She accepted his gift, swallowing quickly before returning to her licking ministrations applied to his godhood. Lera could feel her need swelling in her bladder, a new stream of piss moving to her pussy lips. Her pee shot from her open pee hole and washed over Zayeon's bare feet. He groaned again with animalist delight, treating her to another squirt of piss into her mouth even as she continued to lick his bell-end whilst at the same time cupping his divine ball-sacks with expert hands.<br><br>The spectacle continued, interrupted only by the arrival of each new goddess as she flashed into existence before moving to perform her appointed task. Zayeon watched on as they helped to top up the clam-bowl with their hot piss streams. Some stood as Zera had done, at the edge with their pussy lips poised over the edge before starting to pee. Others squatted over the rim with their round, wide bum cheeks on full display as they opened their pee flaps and urinated into the growing pool of godly effluent.<br><br>Finally, the bowl was full. Being gods the liquid inside was perfectly clear yet as Zayeon sprayed his spunk over Lera's face as he came hard, the fluid inside the clam began to swirl and darken. The King of the Gods moved from his throne, passing the still piss-wet Messenger who had accompanied the last goddess. He stared into the seeming oblivion offered by the vision, reading what only he could read.<br><br>'It is as I feared,' he rumbled with growing anger. 'The Fel are coming. Fel Jardine, the Fallen Garden, will soon appear in the Valley of the Fireflies and inside its dark bowels will be those with the power to unseat us. I will summon a war council but before I do, I require a spy on the moral world to report on the activities of those accursed amazons. Lera, my queen, who do you think would be best be suited to this role.'<br><br>Lera's smirk mirrored that of her immortal husband's as they both slowly turned their heads to stare in Lermes' direction, the piss sodden goddess suddenly becoming aware of the stare being levied in her direction.<br><br>'Yes, my lord and mistress,' she said meekly, the taste of divine piss still upon her lips. With a flash she was gone.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 1</i></p>`,
      2: `<h2>Chapter 1: </h2><p>It had been a dark day from the offset. Sharn had left her village before dawn and when the sun awoke it had been a blood red colour, staining the clouds with its tint. There was a chill in the air this morning, a low white mist clinging to the dew wet grass that grew tall and long at this time of year. Pushing her way through the undergrowth she approached the forest, the gaps between the trees still as dark as the night. Pausing at the boundary to the wood Sharn reached to her back and withdrew her long bow. It was stoutly made, handed down through her family through the ages, repaired on many an occasion. She was proud to do its linage justice. At the tender age of eighteen she was the village archery champion, a proud huntswoman granted the title of 'Triltrist' which meant 'true shot'. Not even old enough to have been bedded by a man, the only sex she had known was the fond embraces of her slightly older sister, Kelharn. They shared a small bed in their family hut, the long dark nights of winter made more pleasant by lying end to end with one another, their moist tongues licking away at each others pussy lips. Sharn loved the sensation of kissing her sisters clit, licking her way around the fleshy protuberance before tracing her way downwards, flicking her tongue deeper and deeper into the warm wetness of her vagina. Eventually they would both climax together and fall into a deep peaceful sleep.<br><br>The two girls would often bathe together in the large bath made from stone and deer hide. The water for their bath came from the local spring and was warmed in pots over the fire beforehand. When ever the temperature of the bath water started to cool, then the girls would use their own special means of heating it up; parting their pussy lips and pissing into the water around their thighs. This would always set the girls off giggling if their mother was in the room as she would always be oblivious to the naughty going-on in the bath. However, if the girls were alone during their bath then would take it in turns to take naughty little pees into the water, either by perching their nude bums on the rim of the bath before proceeding to send down a little shower of pussy piss, or even worse, they would lie in the water with just the base of their pussies sticking out of the water. When they started to pee, the resulting stream of piss would shoot upwards in a little flowing fountain before pattering down into the bath water.<br><br>Just thinking about bathing with her sister was making Sharn desperate to go. Taking a quick look around to make sure she was unobserved she then hiked up the material of her skirt to reveal the dark brown haired triangle of pubic hairs nestled between her legs. With her skirt out of harms way Sharn wasted no more time and started to let out a steaming hot stream of yellow piss which shot out of her pussy lips at the base of her crotch and proceeded to splatter down over the cold earth below. Steam rose from the impact point on the ground where her piss was pattering. The hissing sound of her pee sounded loud in the still morning air and Sharn wondered if this would scare off any potential game nearby. Deciding she best finish her piss as quickly as possible, she squeezed harder watching as the stream of yellow urine flowing out of her body increase in size and distance. Giving a quick shake of her hips from side to side, her bare bum cheeks exposed to the cold air, she played her pee stream over the stems of the nearby grass shoots enjoying the sensation of covering them with her urine. After several more moments of gorgeous relief Sharn finished her morning pee. Allowing her short leather skirt to fall back into place around her muff and bum cheeks, she set off again, pushing past the piss stained grass patch. Within seconds she had plunged into the dark of the woods.<br><br>It took Sharn's eyes several seconds to adapt to the gloom. Once she had her vision back she pressed on. Up ahead, barely two hundred paces was an open glade in which a small spring bubbled up from the rocks and fed into a marsh lined pool which the local game would drink from. Stealthy she made her way through the undergrowth. Beneath her bare feet came no sound, a life time of hunting game making her a deadly stalker. She could see the glade now up ahead, shafts of sunlight piecing the gloom of the wood into the open space. 'There, just between those trees on the right,' she told herself as she spotted the large stag. The animal was grazing, its head lowered to the floor below. She was now thirty paces away, an easy shot for one like her. Slowly and without a sound, she released the bow from her back along with a long barbed arrow. Notching the arrow she straightened to her full height, raising the bow as she moved. Pulling back on her bow she revealed the muscular grace of her slender frame; lithe and powerful with strong arms created from yielding her bow since the time of an early child. She pulled back further, the bow line stretched taught. Sighting along the frame she slowed her breathing knowing that the shot must come between breaths for the arrows flight to be true. The killing moment approached. Her concentration total she had but a few seconds to go...<br><br>Suddenly, from the distance came the urgent tolling of the village bell. Startled by the sound, Sharn released her hold on the line. The arrow shot forth but leapt skyward as her concentration faltered. 'That sound - the warning that the village was under attack!' Quickly she dashed back through the woods in the direction she had come from, all thoughts of stealth dashed by the urgent sounds of the bell from up ahead. As she burst forth from the tree line she plunged through the tall grass stems and undergrowth not even noticing the damp splashes on her clothes and legs and she moved straight through the patch where she had early taken her pee.<br><br>Her feet flew over the ground, her heart pounding in her chest. Her mind was filled with dark thoughts of what the bell warning entailed. She had been but a small girl the last time the bell had been struck. At that time, a small raiding party of bandits had come up from the coast where they had landed in their small ramshackle war boat. The villages had fought them off, the wooden barricade encircling the dwellings defence enough against the badly organised bandits. Whilst in her learning years Sharn had been trained both as a huntress and at the same time, as a defender of the village. Her bow was not only a tool for the retrieval of game for food, but also as a weapon of war to defend her tribe.<br><br>The village was coming into sight now just over the rise of the hill which led down to the main cattle track that led through the village gates. A thick pall of dark black smoke was rising upwards. As Sharn skidded to a halt on the hill crest she looked down to see the defensive barricade on fire. Her heart lurched as she saw the invaders. The distance was still great but she could easily tell that they were well organised and that they meant business. Near the gates but out of bow shot from the surrounding wooden wall, a party of eight cavalry were circling, occasionally shooting lit arrows of flame in the direction of the main gate which was already on fire. Behind this party waited another group possible thirty strong, stood shoulder to shoulder in a box formation obviously waiting for the gates to fail. Sharn dropped to the ground desperately trying to become one with the earth. She stared intently at the figures below. 'Wait, these were not men,' she thought as she took in the figures in detail. Yes, each figure was indeed a woman down to the very last member of the infantry. Each one seemed to be wearing a strange mix of armour, their chests and backs covered in steel, their legs encased in dark leather. It was the final detail that was puzzling Sharn until with a gasp she realised what it was. Each woman was completely exposed at the groin, both buttocks and pussy exposed naked to the watching world. Even having realised the truth to this strange mixture of armour and nudity, Sharn struggled with the concept. She had never heard of warrior women like these, who covered their breasts with steel but yet willingly exposed their womanhood for all to see. 'Who were these attackers and why had they come to her village?'<br><br>From out of the clamour rising up from below and over the tolling bell and the shouts of the villagers came a loud war cry coming from the lead rider. The party of horse mounted warrior women reeled around and formed a rough wedge which suddenly bolted forwards towards the wall of smoke belching from the village gates. They vanished from sight as they plunged into the smoke before a loud crack announced the fall of the gates. Sharn saw them again, bursting forth from the reeling folds of smoke and galloping at full pelt into the village grounds. A new cry arose as the infantry set off at a quick pace which became a run as they neared the broken opening. Sharn marvelled at the women, sunlight reflecting off their steel cheats, flashes of black, brown and blond pubic triangles of the women's pussies as they moved forth. Their formation stayed intact, each woman in perfect line with the women beside her. This spoke of strict martial discipline and once again Sharn was left to wonder at the nature of the attackers.<br><br>The sound of battle coming from the village brought her from her wonderings. She could hear the screams of people dying, women wailing as the invaders cut their way further into the village. Sharn tried to rise but fear was keeping her pinned to the earth. She had never been so scared. She was still too young to be called upon to defend her home from the likes of these Amazons. Between her legs a warm damp stain started to spread over the inside of her leather skirt as hot pee leaked from her young pussy with her fear. Shame washed over Sharn as she lay there, pissing herself whilst her friends and family were being slaughtered. The warmth of her escaping pee trickled down her legs shaming her more. Should she ever arise from her coward's viewpoint, what would she look like rushing to the aid of her village with yellow urine running down her legs?<br><br>A noise from behind caught her attention; the snort of a horse close behind. Desperately she twisted over in the grass moving onto her back, bow and arrow quill digging deep into her flesh. Two Amazon women on horseback came into her vision. How they had approached so close without a sound before now was miraculous. Sharn's gaze was instantly drawn to the first woman. She was a resplendent red head, both tall and beautiful. Her long red strands fell over her polished armour which was stunningly crafted. The woman's armoured breasts were covered in steel with large caps representing her nipples hidden below. This warrior was different in so much that her leggings were also encased in steel, polished so bright that they were painful to stare at in the increasing morning sunlight. The saddle hid the woman's pussy from sight but Sharn could easily tell that she too was not wearing anything around her crotch by the hue of creamy white skin exposed at the base of her chest armour.<br><br>The woman said something to her companion in a strange tongue, her eyes never leaving the form of Sharn in the grass below. Sharn couldn't understand the words, as they were spoken fast and flowed instantly from one into the next. She couldn't tell if this was a question directed at her or a comment made to the warrior on the second horse. Sharn glanced over. Unlike the first warrior woman who rode a tall white stead, this Amazon sat on a tan beast. Although her armour was not as splendid as her companions, was still a worthy looking woman. Golden blond hair, cut short to her creamy white neck, bright blue eyes staring harshly in her direction. Sharn did not dare look downwards to see if this woman was too naked at her crotch.<br><br>The first woman spoke again. This woman was the leader. Sharn was sure of it now. Her tone and manner indicated authority. Her eyes were brown and cold, the look of a killer. Sharn remembered her village below, the sounds of the dying still in the air. Resolve took her. She wouldn't die on the earth like some worthless worm. If she was to die at the hands of these stunning Amazon women with their perfect looks, polished armour and reckless nudity, then she would die with in a bow in her hands. With speed that amazed even her Sharn leapt from the ground her hands reaching to the bow on her back. In one fluid motion she released it and brought it round in one fluid motion. Her spare hand had found her supply of arrows at the same time and as her bow and arrow came together she was already raising her aim, pulling the bow string taunt as she made ready to let fly.<br><br>With amazing dexterity the second blond haired warrior leapt from her saddle, hitting the ground and was on her feet in moments. Sharn caught a brief glimpse of the woman's triangle of blond pubic hairs nestled between creamy white thighs before the warrior's sword blade swatted her bow from her hand. A blow to the head sent Sharn reeling back to the ground as the warrior woman followed up with a strike with the back of her hand. Sharn felt the tears welling in her eyes from the smarting pain of the blow whilst the first women with the red hair and cold eyes slowly dismounted from her horse. The blond warrior grabbed Sharn by the hair and roughly twisted her over onto her stomach and onto the cold damp ground. Then she felt the weight of the warrior leader as she descended over her. A knee was pushed harshly into her back a cold steel blade appeared at Sharn's throat close enough to gently brush the surface of her skin.<br><br>Sharn felt the terror rise in her again. She was going to die and it would be here and now. Once again she felt the warm sensation around her crotch as she peed herself with fear. Suddenly a new warm wet sensation appeared, pattering over the back of her head. It took Sharn several seconds to realise what was happening whilst every moment the wet sensation increased in force soaking through her hair. It was a hot damp flow passing over the back of her neck and into the rear of her tunic. 'She's pissing all over me,' said Sharn's mind in disbelief. The warm flow continued to emanate through her hair the force of the stream strong against the back of her head. Warm trails of piss were flowing down her back soaking her tunic before reaching her waist where it ran around her skin and dripped to the earth.<br><br>Sharn lay quite still whilst the warrior woman relieved herself over the rear of her head and back. Sharn could hear the loud hissing the woman's pee made as it squirted forth out of her slits before shooting through the air to spray into her hair which was now sodden with warm pee. Her own ragged breathing seemed somehow distant as if somebody else was breathing for her. All she could feel was the unceasing flow of piss spraying over the back of her head and flowing down her back. The warmth was wonderful, the shame of it unbelievable. Could anybody in the village witness this event if they weren't too busy dying? What would they think to look up at the hill and see this warrior leader busily relieving herself over the young huntress who had not even managed to release a single shot?<br><br>The impact point of the woman's pee on the back of her head was diminishing now. The warm trail of piss flowing down her back reducing as the flow of urine ceased. The cold blade which had been at her throat all the time the woman had been relieving herself suddenly vanished. She felt the woman stand up and move away. Sharn just lay in the grass covered in the woman's piss. She was utterly spent, the shame of being used as a toilet by this woman stealing her energy. Dimly she wondered what would happen next when suddenly she felt the feet of the second woman coming to stand on either side of her waist. She nearly cried out loud when her skirt was suddenly flicked upwards exposing her wide peach like bum cheeks to the open air. Fear made her bit her tongue, painfully so, drawing blood. Then a new familiar sensation arrived, this time pattering over her bare bum as the blond warrior started her piss. From above Sharn's buttocks, a thick twisting steam of hot pee was flowing out of the blond woman's pussy. It fell downwards in a twisting fountain to land over Sharn's exposed bum, running over her curved cheeks, off to the sides and between the groove and over her bum hole, soaking the hairs of her own pussy with this woman's urine.<br><br>Once again Sharn was used as a receptacle for a warrior woman's piss, her body being subjected to a hot flow of running urine whilst the woman peed all over her. The woman had taken a step forwards bring her fountain of flowing piss to land over the back of Sharn's tunic. Now Sharn was having her back pissed over, this time having hot pee run over the back of her tunic instead of over her skin underneath. This woman's toilet lasted another couple of seconds. She finished with one long burst of piss which shot from her pussy lips and fell just shot of Sharn's neck.<br><br>Sharn lay in the piss stained dirt not daring to move. 'What now' she wondered. Maybe they would bring up the rest of the troops and one by one they would squat down over her naked body and subject her to a shower of pee. Maybe they would just abandon her here, a piss stained tribute to the horror they had delivered to the village.' Strong hands grabbed her and pulled her roughly to her feet. Blinking pee out of her eyes from where it had run round the back of her head during the first woman's piss, Sharn tried to focus. With a shock she realised that the Amazon leader who had pulled her up, was completely devoid of hair around her pussy lips. Sharn gazed in wonder at the sight of the tight slit of the woman's pussy, her clit clearly visible at the top. In her village no woman would ever shave her muff and yet here was this powerful woman clearly showing off her naked pussy lips for the entire world to see.<br><br>Sharn was pulled from her musings by sharp foreign words obviously spoken for her benefit. She tried to reply, to state that she didn't understand, but as she opened her mouth she suddenly tasted the piss on her lips, salty and strange to her taste buds. Roughly, the warrior leader threw Sharn in the direction of the second warrior who caught her and forced her to stand straight whilst she tried her hands together with a strong thin rope. Head hung low Sharn stared at the woman's pussy, the blond triangle of pubic hairs which only recently had been squirting her body with a shower of hot pee. After securing her hands the blond warrior roughly turned Sharn around and all vision was lost as she then tied a blind around Sharn's eyes. The next thing she knew, her clothes were being roughly stripped from her skin exposing her nudity to her foes. Now naked she was pushed forwards roughly being held on one shoulder to steer her down the hill. The reek of burning wood and the smell of charcoaled flesh filled the air. Sharn wondered in abject misery how many still lived in her village. At least with her clothes removed it may not be obvious to any survivors as to what had happened on the hill.<br><br>Her mouth was still filled with the sharp tang of piss and her skin was beginning to chill as the damp stains on her flesh began to dry. Standing shivering in the cold air she waited in darkness straining to make out the various sounds around her. Not once did she hear a familiar voice only the strange language of these warrior women who had sowed their seed of destruction on her village. Eventually a new pair of strong female hands grabbed her and helped her roughly on to the back of a horse. Seconds later she was joined by a warrior behind her. The cold of her armour stole the last of the warmth from her bare skin, the hardened steel nipples of the woman's upper armour pressing cruelly into her back. In contrast, Sharn's bare bum cheeks were suddenly warmed as the woman pressed up closely in the saddle next to her. Sharn could clearly feel the woman's pubic hairs of her pussy pressed up against her backside. Suddenly an order was barked out and Sharn recognising the leader's strong voice. The horse she was mounted upon turned and started a brisk walk. From the sound around her, Sharn realised that they were not alone and that the Amazon women were leaving. Behind her came the low howl of a village dog and Sharn realised that this creature may be the only thing left alive in her village. Breaking down in both shame and loss she started to cry. The woman in the saddle behind her offered no comfort, only a hard grasp to stop her from falling from their mount.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 2</i></p><div class='note'>https://nakedblades.org/home/stories/legends-of-the-fel/chapter-1/</div>`,
      3: `<h2>Chapter 2: On the Road to Fel Jardine</h2><p>The rest of the day passed in misery for Sharn. Pressed up in the front of the saddle with her tall warrior guardian behind her, she felt cold, cramped and in a dull state of shock at the loss of her family and friends. The fact that the warrior woman's armoured steel nipples constantly bit into the flesh of her bare back was not helping matters. She was too numb now to even cry. The only warmth apart from the feeble rays of the autumn sun was coming from the pubic patch of her guardian's pussy, pressed up tight against Sharn's bare bum cheeks. She nearly cried out loud when the woman, without warning, suddenly started to urinate. A hot wet stream of piss squirted out of the woman's pussy lips and sprayed over Sharn"s bare skin, running between into the groove between her buttocks, past her bum hole to her waiting pussy which immediately became drenched in the other woman's pee. Sharn couldn't help herself and within seconds she was taking a piss of her own; her pussy lips parting to allow her young pee hole to squirt out a similar flow of hot yellow, flowing out onto the leather saddle. Still being blindfolded she had no idea if anybody could witness her shame, let alone if the woman behind her who was still pissing over her bum had noticed the second stream of yellow pee being done over the horse's back. The force of the pee stream squirting over her bare buttocks slowly began to diminish as the Amazon warrior finished her leak. Sharn desperately forced closed her own pee flaps shut even though she was still bursting to go.<br><br>They had now been on the road for hours now, the mounted troop moving in silence except for the sounds of horse hooves on the earth below. Miserably Sharn wondered if there were infantry walking behind them or if the troops were still back at her village finishing off their slaughter. Suddenly a cry in a foreign tongue came from up a head. Sharn tilted her head trying to recognise the voice. Was this the same red headed warrior who had first peed over her earlier in the day? Sharn recalled the cold beauty of the woman. Her fiery red headed mane of hair, falling past creamy white skin, intense brown eyes and most of all, the patch of bare flesh at the woman's waist, her beautifully shaved pussy lips with her clit protruding at the top.<br><br>The horse she was mounted upon came to an abrupt halt and Sharn would have fallen from her mount had the woman behind her not caught her and roughly pulled her back. Moments later a second strong pair of hands grabbed her from below and hoisted Sharn from her perch and lowered her to the ground. A fumbling at the back of her head signalled the release of her blindfold. Blinking in the light Sharn took in her surroundings. They had come to stop in a leafy glade, sunlight streaming in through the green canopy above. Birds sang their song in the afternoon breeze and off to the right came the gentle sound of running water.<br><br>Around her the rest of the warrior women were dismounting. Their patches of pubic hair nestled between their exposed legs catching Sharn"s attention once again. She had not realized before but all of warrior women stood several hands height above her. Each woman was stunningly beautiful. As a group they were a complete mixture of different skin tones, from creamy white to dark brown. Most warriors wore helmets obscuring their hair but when Sharn was not too busy taking in the sight of the various pussies on display, she noticed that each woman had a most piercing stare, as if their eyes were backlit from behind. She shivered and this time not from the chill of the day. A sharp push to her back brought her out of her trance and she staggered forwards. Strong hands grabbed her arms from behind and the rag that had been her blindfold was reused, this time to bind her hands. Once bound she was made to kneel down facing a tall oak tree her vision now one solely of mottled bark. It was then no surprise to suddenly feel a new hot stream of piss shooting into her hair as the woman who had led her here began to use her as a toilet.<br><br>The warm strong gushing stream of the woman's urine played through Sharn's rough brown hair and washed over her skin underneath. If nothing else the warmth of having piss run down her back was warming her up, although Sharn was feeling the now familiar feeling of humility and shame as she was used as a latrine. The spray of urine squirting over her hair and back soon started to diminish before stopping entirely. Sharn had thought the woman had finished but then came two last hard squirts of pee leaping from the woman's uncovered pussy and playing down over Sharn's back.<br><br>Sharn felt the woman move away and decided now was probably the best time for her to relive the rest of her own pent up piss. Parting her legs Sharn allowed the burning sensation in her bladder to race its way down to waiting pussy. Within seconds she was sending a spraying torrent of hot pee over the grassy ground between her legs. She was so absorbed with watching herself urinate over the earth, enjoying the sensation of relief whilst she emptied her bladder, that she did not notice the presence standing beside her until it was too late. Sharn"s head spun round as she suddenly realised that she was not alone. A young girl roughly the same age as Sharn, was intently watching her pee. Unlike the warriors this girl wore no armour and was dressed instead in dark brown leggings and matching tunic. The most obvious difference was that instead of being naked around the crotch, this girl's pubic regions was hidden from sight whilst her large firm breasts were exposed, her tunic top being cut perfectly to expose her assets.<br><br>Sharn stared at the girls breasts. She had never seen such a well endowed girl; her tits were fantastically large but yet perfectly portioned to the girls frame. Rose bud nipples capped the girl's breasts, fully erect and pointed proudly outwards. Suddenly Sharn realised that she was still relieving herself, her golden pussy shower squirting out of her parted pussy lips. She started to blush, looking up to the girl's face to see her watching expression. She had bright blue eyes and a beautiful mane of long flowing blond hair. Unlike the warrior women around them her face held no expression of cruelty only one of profound interest as she watched Sharn's golden stream flowing over the grass. Sharn saw no sense in stopping so she continued peeing, her urine shower flowing out of her muff until falling away as she completed her pee.<br><br>The girl spoke for the first time as Sharn's toilet came to an end.<br><br>"I can see why they chose you" she said in a soft gentle voice. Startled by the girl speaking in a language she understood, Sharn remained dumb. The girl was obviously not of local stock. Sharn had never seen such golden hair before and the girl's skin was too light in shade to herald from a village of the Telhirst.<br><br>"My name is Felquest" she continued giving Sharn a charming smile. "You have a lovely pussy".<br><br>Sharn was shocked. Village girls never gave complements on each other's pubic properties, but there again they never watched you while you peed either.<br><br>"What is your name?" the girl asked not perturbed by Sharn's continuing silence.<br><br>Sharn stole another quick look at the girl's ample bosom before replying in a whisper, Sharn."<br><br>"Sharn. That is a pretty name." Another smile and Sharn felt herself warming to this new stranger.<br><br>"Well Sharn I have been assigned as your guardian. Until a member of the Felkadakarin claims you as her own, I will be your tutor in the ways of our clan."<br><br>The last comment caught Sharn's attention. This girl was one of them! There was so much she needed to know. She started to speak, words blurting out before she could collect her thoughts.  "Why did this happened? Why am I been spared when the rest of my village was butchered? Who were you and why do they expose your vaginas for all to see?'<br><br>"Quiet!" urged Felquest. "All in good time. Now it is important that you remain quiet and do not draw attention to us. Here, let me free your hands".<br><br>The blond girl moved out of sight behind Sharn and she felt gentle fingers freeing her bonds. As her hands became free Sharn brought them round to her front and started to massage the blood back into them. A soft touch on her shoulder caused her to look up and see Felquest waiting for here, her large breasts once again drawing Sharn's attention. Her own, much smaller breasts felt meagre in comparison. She felt a deep shame to be in the company of such a stunning beauty when her own nakedness was on display, her hair and back covered in splotches of piss where the warrior women had urinated over her.<br><br>Managing to gain her feet Sharn followed Felquest through the light foliage down to the river she had heard earlier. On the embankment Felquest gave her one of her reassuring smiles and motioned for Sharn to enter the water, obviously meaning for Sharn to clean herself. She obliged plunging into the waist deep water, the shocking cold numbing her senses. Felquest giggled at Sharn's obvious distress.<br><br>"Hurry," she urged. "We don't have too much time."<br><br>Sharn tried to oblige. The water was freezing. Nevertheless she started to wash, desperately scrubbing her back and mangled brown hair in an attempt to remove all trace of the urine. Noises from upstream caused Sharn to look up. Just around a slight bend in the stream she could clearly see the forms of a small group of the Amazon warriors. The women were in the process of disrobing, steel armour and pieces of leather clothing falling to the grassy bank. As the women became nude Sharn gasped at their regal beauty. Long muscular legs rose to perfectly formed buttocks, strong backs, and ample breasts. There was a variety of hair colours on display, brown, blond and jet black but no sign of the fiery red of their leader. Sharn had no idea why she yearned to see that woman again. Maybe it was because she had been the first to pee all over her or maybe because of her shaved pussy which had so entranced Sharn when she had first seen it.<br><br>A dark skinned woman had started to pee whilst still stood on the bank. The woman's shower of golden piss cascaded down to the ground below in a strong flowing stream. As Sharn watched on, another woman took the opportunity to take a piss. From behind, a thick golden stream of flowing urine suddenly appeared under the groove of her peach like bum cheeks, falling between the space in her legs and down to the earth below.<br><br>'Did all these women pee standing up?' Sharn wondered. If nothing else it was a relief to see them peeing in the open without them coming looking for her to use as a receptacle for their toilet.<br><br>"Sharn. Quickly they must not see you whilst they are urinating. They would kill you for sure."<br><br>Sharn took her eyes from the sight of the two pissing beauties upstream.<br><br>"Come back up here before you are seen," Felquest urged desperately.<br><br>Wondering why it was so important that she was not caught witnessing the sight of these women peeing, Sharn scrambled back up onto the bank, panting with both the effort and the receding chill as she exited the water's cold embrace. Felquest pushed her into a crouch with gentle but yet firm hands, and motioned for her to follow her to the nearby bushes. Peering through the foliage Sharn was able once again to spy on the Amazons. The first woman had finished her leak and had joined her companions in the river but the brown woman was still pissing strongly over the ground at her feet. The woman was still stood with her back to the watching girls seemed to oblivious to the fact that onlookers were intently watching her as she relieved herself. At the base of her bum was still the thick golden stream as the woman pissed strongly out of her pussy lips. As the seconds passed the stream of piss leaving the woman's crotch began to diminish until it vanished from sight. Having finished her relief the brown warrior woman dropped off the side of the river bank and into the river water. Sharn caught a quick look of the woman's large breasts as she plunged into the river. She realized now that she actually getting quite horny, the sight of such much naked flesh exciting her in spite of all that had occurred.<br><br>She stole another good look at Felquest's exposed tits and wondered what this girl's pussy would taste like if she had the opportunity to place her tongue between her lower lips. Felquest was still peering through the bushes and seemed obviously to Sharn's wandering gaze which was now centred on her crotch. The idea of licking this blond girl's pussy was now firmly lodged in Sharn's mind along with the thought of playing her moist tongue over those incredible breasts. Suddenly she became aware of Felquest's gaze and quickly met it, her face blushing with embarrassment.<br><br>"Oh Sharn, you have so much to learn," she sighed. "However I too need to go so try and control your urges for now whilst I pee. I have no desire to hurt you but I will should you try and touch my body whilst I am disrobed. With that she stood up and reached down to the cord around her waist. Undoing it, she quickly slid her leggings down her bare legs exposing in the process the triangular shaped mass of blond pubic hairs nestled between her thighs. Felquest then squatted down over the ground she spread her legs wide giving Sharn a perfect view at her pussy lips and her little clit poking out at the top. Within seconds Felquest began to pee. Her pussy flaps parted and a thick stream of yellow piss shot out and formed a flowing golden arch which pattered over the grass stems below. Sharn bit her lip to help her stay her hand from entering into Felquest's flowing piss stream. The flowing honey coloured shower of urine looked so beautiful as it flowed out of the blond girl's pussy. The pee stream played over the ground dancing between grass steams and the brown soil, making a gentle pattering sound as it fell. Felquest's pussy look every bit as good as Sharn had imagined, the slit between her legs a perfect receptacle for her tongue. Felquest also had an exquisite bum with large firm cheeks which she so would love to hold in her hands whilst she buried her head in the blond girl's pussy.<br><br>The slow diminish of Felquest's piss shower over the earth brought Sharn out of her fantasy. At last her pussy lips closed sealing off her pee and she stood to dress whilst Sharn watched with great disappointment as her pussy vanished from sight under her leggings.<br><br>"Now you have seen me pee as well," Felquest said tying the cord around her waist. "This does not make us equals however and I expect you to follow my commands when I give them."<br><br>"And if I don't?" said Sharn defiantly.<br><br>"Then the warriors will kill you," sighed Felquest. "I wish for us to be friends. You have a lovely body and it would be a shame to see it split asunder by Fawn's rage."<br><br>Remembering she was still naked and in no position to offer resistance, Sharn meekly asked "Who is Fawn?"<br><br>"She is the leader of the party. The warrior with the blood red hair, but come, I have said too much for now. I must get you back and ready for the journey to Fel Jardine". She motioned a finger to her lips to signal silence and then motioned for Sharn to follow her back up the slight incline and into the clearing.<br><br>Sharn was surprised to find that a large cart had arrived during their time down by the river. Two large brown mares pulled the carriage which had steep wooden walls and mounted iron rails stretched in an arc, side to side. She felt her heart go heavy again. This was a prison transport. She followed Felquest around its side and obediently climbed up the short ladder at the back and into the cage. Felquest followed her in and motioned for her to sit down on the straw covered flooring. The blond girl then joined her, sitting down opposite. With a lurch the cart started to move. Felquest said nothing seeming to be lost in a far away trance which seemed to involve staring intently at Sharn's naked body. She flinched under the scrutiny once again wishing she had been endowed with larger breasts to equal Felquest's exposed tits. A soft clink in the straw beside made her turn to discover an earth jar and jug beside her. Inside were clean water and a piece of fresh bread, along with a block of cheese. Grabbing them eagerly, Sharn set about filling her belly, glad of a distraction from Felquest's gaze.<br><br>The cart moved on, bumping from time to time over rocks on the dirt track. The wooden sides to the cart were too high for Sharn to see the outside world but she knew she was already too lost to know the way. In the distance a peel of thunder heralded the oncoming of an autumn storm. Sharn looked up at the darkening skies and shivered at the thought of the coming rain. As a huntress for her village she was a hardy girl, but she dreaded the cold lashings of the mountain's rains upon her bare skin. She looked back to Felquest but the blond girl had now fallen asleep. All thoughts of sexual intercourse with this girl had now faded from her mind replaced by the more pressing concern to escape hyperthermia from the coming storm. Standing as best she could with the low ceiling of bars she made her way to the front of the cart scanning the thick straw covering for anything that may be of use as a cover. Her relief was palpable as at the far wall she discovered a large and somewhat dirty covering possibly intended at one time to wrap over the framework of bars overhead. Now too threadbare to cover the entire length of the prison transport it had been abandoned here instead. Lifting it up Sharn clambered in, pulling the course fabric around her bare skin. This was just in time as the first splotches of rain started to land on the straw floor. With moments the weather had turned completely and thick cold rain drops began to hammer down from the grey skies overhead.<br><br>Felquest woke with a start and looked around and then up with a startled expression. Seeing Sharn bundled in the cloth at the top end of the cart she scrambled up and quickly made her way to join her. Without a word she lifted up the edge of the cloth and entered beneath its relative safety sitting down next to the shivering form of Sharn. The girls sat without a word as the rain increased in its fury, hammering down on the wooden prison transport with a vengeance. The outside world had vanished from sight obscured by a wall of grey rain. The temperature had plummeted with the downpour and Sharn was shivering uncontrollably. Felquest must have noticed her distress as she moved closer to her and placed a warm arm around her shoulder drawing her closer. Sharn was all too grateful for the comfort and warmth Felquest offered and put her own arms around the other girl's chest drawing her as close as possible feeling the warmth emanating from her large exposed breasts. Sharn felt safe in this embrace, slowly starting to warm again. She was still shivering and Felquest was running a hand through her hair muttering soothing words as if to a small child.<br><br>Sharn stared at the rose bud nipple, hard and exposed only a small distance away from her waiting mouth. Slowly Sharn started to kiss Felquest's left breast enjoying the warmth coming from her skin. Felquest made no move to stop her so she continued edging closer and closer to the waiting nipple. Then it was inside her mouth, her tongue licking urgently around the hard protuberance. Her left hand moved up from around Felquest's waist and cupped her right breast, fingers tracing over the skin to caress the second nipple. Felquest let out a soft moan just audible above the pattering rain. The hand in Sharn's hair continued to play with her strands but this time with more urgency. Sharn continued to lick the nipple in her mouth, tasting its flavour with her tongue, tracing its shape over and over again. Her right hand was firmly squeezed around Felquest's right tit, squeezing, contracting and squeezing again her actions becoming more and more intense. With a start she realized that Felquest had moved her spare hand down to her waist and was now buried in the crotch of her leggings and Sharn realized that she busily playing with herself, her fingers plying in and out of her moist vagina.<br><br>Coming up for air Sharn let go of the nipple in her mouth. Within seconds Felquest's lips had found hers and deep and passionate kiss followed. Sharn realised her hold on Felquest's right breast and traced her way urgently down the girl's body seeking her pussy. Within moments she found her target and she replaced Felquest's plunging fingers with her own. Her pussy was lovely and tight, moist and slippery wet. The feeling of sliding her two longest fingers in and out of this lovely pussy was gorgeous and it took a moment to realise that Felquest's straying hand had found her own pussy lips. She let out a groan of ecstasy between kisses as Felquest started to return the favour of being fingered.<br><br>The two girls tossed and turned in the sodden cloth, the outside world forgotten about as they gave each other pleasure. Their kisses grew more passionate, tongue licking over tongue and their excitement rose. Their tits rose on fell on their partners exposed chest, nipple rubbing over nipple as they caressed. Between each girl's legs the fire of ecstasy continued to well, wet fingers thrusting in and out of their partner's vagina as they pumped away. Then it was over. A wave of pure enjoyment and sexual relief spread from Sharn's groin as she climaxed. Her breathing ragged her lips parted from Felquest's mouth and she breathed deeply of the damp air around her. Her chest was pounding, her small breasts rising and falling as she gasped for air. Beneath her Felquest had reached her own orgasm and was lost in an internal world of pleasure. Never had Sharn experienced such a deep sexual satisfaction. The years spent screwing her sister seemed meaningless in comparison. Bending down she gave Felquest another kiss, this time one of gratitude instead of pleasure. She could taste the salt of her partner's sweat upon her lips, a shear delicacy. Seconds later she lapsed exhausted into a deep sleep. Meanwhile the cart continued its journey onwards through the driving rain, to the unknown destination that was Fel Jardine.</p><div class='note'><i>Continued in Chapter 3</i></div>`,
      4: `<h2>Chapter 3: Escape</h2><p>Sharn awoke to find Felquest gone. Pushing back the folds of the fabric protecting her body she squinted in the sharp sunlight. Judging by the rays piercing the grey clouds overhead it was the early morning of a new day. She had no idea at what stage Felquest had left the cart or even when their transport had stopped to allow her exit. Blinking in the cold air she gazed over the wooden wall and through the iron bars at the world around her. The prison cart was ascending a rugged path which twisted and turned its way up a steep slope. On either side, steep walls of dark rock thrust out of the ground and raised themselves skywards where they formed a sharp outline against the rushing clouds in the heavens above. Looking down the cart and out of the back, Sharn gazed in wonder at the visage of the mountain range laid out before her. The cart had obviously climbed a great deal during her sleep. Their path was now higher than most of the peeks below.<br><br>Sharn had never been so far north as to see the 'Sleeping Giants' as her people referred to them. The whole northern range had always been shunned by the villages as nothing grew or lived in the cold waste lands. At least that was what they had always believed. Sharn stared at the mountain range behind them. Maybe she was to be abandoned in the mountains and left to starve. No! What would be the sense in bringing all this way when they could have easily taken her life at any stage? What had Felquest said about a destination? A name? Fel Jardine?<br><br>Thinking of Felquest gave way to strange emotions inside Sharn. Their love making had been intense, their passion genuine. However, she felt a flicker of betrayal at her custodian's absence. Then she remembered her village and the slaughter that had taken place. Overwhelmed she burst into tears. Meanwhile the cart continued on its way a small cloud of dust rising in their wake as the wheels bit deeply into the loose stones. Sharn yawned amidst her sobs. So was so tired. Maybe if she just closed her eyes for a minute...<br><br>Sharn came to. She had no idea why she was so tired. She didn't even recall having fallen back into sleep. Blinking rapidly she stared out from the cart's confines. The scenery had changed dramatically. The grey stone mountains had vanished and they were now surrounded by growing red veins in a tunnel of darkness. The air too was different. Gone was the clean mountain air. Instead the space around her was filled with thick and cloying fumes which were getting thicker by the minute. Coughing Sharn raised her body from her make shift blanket and tried to stare over the high wall at the front of the cart.<br><br>"Hello" she spluttered. "Can you hear me?"<br><br>There was no reply. For all she could tell, the horses pulling the cart were the only ones guiding her transport. She tried again. "Hello?" her voice was hoarser now. It was getting harder to breath.<br><br>She realised now that the cart was in a narrow tunnel leading downwards. The glowing red cracks in the dark walls were giving off the illumination and also seemed to be the source of the contamination in the air. Retching Sharn collapsed onto the rough wooden floor. The heat was building and for once she was glad she was naked. Beads of sweat covered her body. The hair on her head and that between her legs was matted with sweat. The urge to urinate was coming over her again so she simply let it go. Between her legs a thin yellow stream started to patter down over the carts wooden planks as she relieved her bladder urge. Her little pee hole was open wide now, her golden pussy shower flowing strongly out from her vagina lips. A strange hissing sound caused Sharn to look up from the part of the wooden floor she had been starring at numbly whilst she carried out her toilet. She now gazed in wonder at the sight before her. Where her yellow pee was washing over the floor boards, a growing hole was beginning to grow directly in the middle of her piss stream. The shock of seeing her pee eating through the floor caused Sharn to cease her pee. As her pussy flaps sealed themselves shut she pulled her knees up to her chest and hugged them tightly. 'What kind of world had she entered where the walls glowed in the dark and her wee became like acid?<br><br>The puddle of piss on the floor continued to eat away the wooden planking, the hole in the centre growing by the second. By the time the last of golden piss had vanished, the hole was big enough to put both hands through. Sharn stared through the hole but the ground lacked enough illumination to be visible. A faint glimmer of hope stirred Sharn out of her withdrawn position. Coming to rest on her knees with her legs slightly parted, she aimed her pussy careful at the edge of the hole. Within seconds she was letting a new stream of piss out of her vagina. Her thin stream of pee arched away from her cunt and pattered over a fresh patch of wood near the hole. Once again the surface of the cart's floor started to hiss and bubble as Sharn's pee shower ate through it. She was too excited by the possibility of escape to worry about the effects her new found ability may have on her body. Instead she pissed for several more seconds over the floor before stopping and waited with baited breath to see how big the new hole would be.<br><br>After several long moments, the burning in the wood stopped. The hole was now twice as big but yet too small for Sharn to squeeze through. Moving to a new spot on the cart's floor Sharn took careful aim with her pussy and then started to squirt out a new piss shower. A strong stream of pee leapt from her vagina and began to patter over the floor dissolving the wood in the process. Sharn was almost spent of pee now and she new this would be the last piss she would be able to take over the wood. Desperately she hoped it would be enough. As the last drips of piss escaped her pussy lips she watched with hope as the new second hole reached the first. 'Yes ‚Äì it was big enough!' she thought with joy. Approaching the ragged hole in the floor she wondered for a moment if her own pee would burn her skin if she came into contact with it as she dropped down. There was only one way to find out so Sharn wasted no more time. With a quick step she plunged through the hole, hitting the hard stone floor below. With the grace of a true huntress Sharn softened her body upon impact flowing into a smooth roll which took her out of harms way as the rear of the cart passed overhead. The cloying air burned her lungs even more with the sudden exertion and she found her body racked with a series of coughs which she desperately tried to muffle. She lay on the road, her hands over her mouth whilst her chest was racked with a new coughing fit. The light was so dim that so could no longer see the cart or judge if it had stopped or continued on oblivious to her escape. Not wanting to find out the hard way how successful her jail break had been, Sharn set off up the slight tunnel incline.<br><br>Sharp stones bit into her feet hindering her progress. The air was still heavy and breathing was difficult but after a while Sharn was sure she could detect a change coming from up the slope. The faintest hint of a breeze seemed to be coming from uphill and this spurred her on but after what seemed an age of travelling over the sharp rock floor of the tunnel, she had still not arrived at the tunnel's entrance. The need in her bladder had become acute again so Sharn stopped and squatted down over the floor. In the faint red light given off by the gleaming veins in the tunnel wall, she started to pee. Her pussy flaps parted to allow her hot piss juices to come flowing out of her vagina and empty into the air of the tunnel. A soft pattering sound announced the arrival of Sharn's piss landing over the rock floor. Desperately she stared between her legs trying to ascertain if her pee shower was eating into the rock just like it had burnt through the wood of the prison cart. Unfortunately the dim lighting did not allow her a good vision of her toilet stream flowing out of her cunt and she had no choice but to continue her wee without the knowledge of what damage it might be causing. She was terrified that from now on her golden showers would be cursed with an acid-like eating ability. She was just finishing her piss when a faint noise coming from the upward direction of the tunnel caught her attention. At first she thought it was just her imagination but as the noise increased she realised that it was a real sound being made by the fall of horse hooves on the tunnel floor.<br><br>Standing up from her toilet squat she turned to flee back the way she had come. It was only a few footfalls until her leading foot tripped over a sharp outcrop in the rocky floor and she was sent flying. She landed badly, small cuts appearing on her body as she fell and tumbled over the numerous small rocks littering the tunnel's surface. Miserably she pulled herself up and with a deep shock realised that the hoof beats were almost upon her. Looking up in terror she was just in time to see the tall white stallion emerging at full gallop out of the dim red gloom. The horse upon seeing her reared, almost dismounting its rider. Sharn looked on in horror fearing for her life. If the horse did not kill her then surely the Fel rider would. Staggering backwards to avoid the failing hoofs she smashed the back of her head on the tunnel wall behind her. Pain lanced through her skull, her vision darkening as she plunged into unconsciousness. Her last memory was that of the rearing horse bearing down upon her once more.<br><br><i></i>Continued in Chapter 4</p>`,
      5: `<h2>Chapter 4: Arrival</h2><p>A hot wet substance spraying over her face brought Sharn around. Spluttering she burst into a fit of coughing and instantly received a mouthful of the liquid being played over her head. Piss! It was a stream of piss that somebody was squirting all over her face! Spluttering she spat out the hot salty urine. Blinking the stinging substance out of her eyes she stared up with hatred at the form standing over her, only to see the familiar figure of Felquest.<br><br>"Why did you do that?" she screamed in disgust. She had never drunk anybody else's pee before. It was only as a small girl when she had once experimented with drinking her own wee from a cup she had peed into, that she now recognised the taste.<br><br>"Quite" urged Felquest. The shooting stream of piss flowing from her muff vanishing now. She was standing over Sharn, her leggings around her ankles and her blond muff on full display along with her large breasts, as per usual.<br><br>The memory of the taste of Felquest's pussy hole sprung into Sharn's mind as she lay with her back to the wall still gagging slightly from the after taste of the piss in her mouth.<br><br>"Why?" she asked blinking again.<br><br>"I'm so sorry Sharn. It was not my intent to claim you in this way but I needed to wake you from your slumber and time is very short."<br><br>"Why?" Sharn asked again weakly. The back of her head was throbbing badly now.<br><br>"When I discovered what had been done to the drink in your cart, I realised what you do when you discovered its effects. For you to escape in such a way would directly incriminate me and as such Felalakine my mistress would have slain me out of hand. There are events in motion Sharn that you have no notion about and are but a small piece of a terrible plan. If we survive our arrival at Fel Jardine then I will make it my mission to explain as much as possible, but not now...."<br><br>Grabbing her roughly by one arm Felquest dragged Sharn to her feet.<br><br>"I've escaped once. I'll do it again," Sharn retorted.<br><br>"You don't understand. Your drink was tampered with and a strong elixir added which gave strength to your urine. The effects will already be wearing off and you would not be able to do it again. Besides this was a means to incriminate me in your escape and whoever planned this subterfuge will surely have a plan to deal with your flight on foot. It was by pure chance I discovered what had been done and have ridden many long hours to reach you before it was too late."<br><br>"What do you mean by too late?" Sharn asked, more quietly this time.<br><br>"For one, without the antidote, you will start to experience an unpleasant burning in your bladder as the drink changes its composition. This over time would become worse until you met with a most unpleasant death." She paused, passing Sharn a drinking pouch from her horse's saddle.<br><br>"Secondly, a score of Fel warriors are not far behind me. They ride to Fel Jardine to report on the progress of the army. Drink the contents of what I have just given you and you will be safe from the poison in your body."<br><br>Sharn took a swig of the drink. It tasted like liquid honey and after a surprised first mouthful, started to gulp down the remainder. Licking her lips she gave Felquest a quick smile.<br><br>"That was lovely. I must remember to get poisoned more often!" Suddenly the last of Felquest's conversation sunk in. "Army, what army?"<br><br>"Our army, Sharn. The army of the Fel. Even now it is descending from our homeland with its purpose to slaughter every man, woman and child upon this continent. The raid on your village was just one of many being conducted by small scouting parties taking place up and down the coast. Nobody will be spared from the coming slaughter."<br><br>"Why? Why would they do such a thing? I was spared, surely they will spare others."<br><br>"Poor Sharn! You really have no idea do you? You are one of the few exceptions to the rule, one of a handful to be saved, at least for a short time."<br><br>"What do you mean, for a short time?"<br><br>"Not now Sharn, not now. I must get you to Fel Jardine so events can unfold as they must. You will learn in time what is to happen to you. Take my hand while I help you into the saddle."<br><br>Reluctantly taking Felquest's hand Sharn put one bare foot into the saddle and swung herself up onto the beast. Felquest adjusted her lower clothing ensuring her pussy was hidden from sight before joining Sharn on the horse.<br><br>"When do I get to pee on you?" asked Sharn indignantly. She could feel Felquest's warm nipples and breasts pressing into her back as the Fel girl kicked their mount into action. With a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, Sharn realised they were heading back the way she had come, deeper into the tunnel.<br><br>"You don't, not ever," whispered Felquest into her ear. "You have a lot to learn about us Fel and you will soon be initiated in the way of the golden stream."<br><br>"By golden stream you mean piss, don't you?" retorted Sharn. She was beginning to wonder if she shouldn't try overpowering her girl behind her and make good her escape on horseback. Surely she would be able to outpace any warriors she met on the way.<br><br>"Yes, Sharn. What you call piss is very special to the warriors of the Fel. It can be a means of subduing a vanquished foe, a tool for dominating a mate or slave, but most specially, it is the food for our gods."<br><br>"What rubbish!" sputtered out Sharn at this last comment. "The gods don't like piss, they need blood, sacrifices on the alter; offerings from slain cattle to help the corn in the fields grow long."<br><br>"Oh Sharn. You have so much to learn. The gods of the Fel are real, not like the false idols your people worship. The golden streams from the warrior women of the Fel are the juices that sustain them in their dark temples beneath the fortress of Fel Jardine. The blood on the battlefield is the food that makes them grow. When enough blood has been shed they will rise amongst us and take back their rightful place back amongst the stars."<br><br>Sharn had never heard such rubbish. Piss drinking gods that lived under the earth. The people of the Fel were obviously quite mad. However, Felquest had spoken with such conviction she thought it best to bite her tongue. She then said her own silent prayer to her own god; Treg, the deity of the huntress, begging for a release from this nightmare. Suddenly a thought struck her.<br><br>"How many days have passed since your people murdered my village?" she quickly asked over her shoulder. The horse was making fast progress down the tunnel and already the air was becoming thick again with the cloying substance she had been subjected to whilst on the cart.<br><br>"Ten days. The drink in the cart was also a strong sedative and you would have slept most of the way."<br><br>Sharn coughed. The air was getting too thick to breath.<br><br>"Try and hold your breath and only breathe through your nose when you must have air," Felquest instructed. She continued, "We ride now through the very veins of 'Fel-a-libon' the mother goddess of all the Fel gods and hence the air is not for the likes of us mortals. However, all passages to Fel Jardine are such as these and all must pass through the goddess on the way to the homelands."<br><br>Sharn closed her eyes which were stinging now and tried to hold her breath. The tunnel vibrated with the sound of hoof beats as the horse ran on. Just when Sharn thought she could last no longer she suddenly felt a strong wind suddenly blowing down the tunnel towards them. Gasping for clean air she blinked her eyes open. The tunnel around them had widened considerably, its height growing in proportion to the broadening sides. Up ahead the tunnel became a wide cavern its floor sloping upwards into a steep incline and an open mouth of clear blue sky. Sharn had never seen anything so beautiful after all her time in the cave. Her eyes were watering as they made their way up the slope, the strong legs of their mount making short work of the uphill trail. At the very top of the slope was a sight that would live with Sharn for the rest of her days.<br><br>The open mouth of the cave system ended on the upper lip of a wide curving layer that ran on for miles around the edge of an impossibly enormous cavern, many times larger than the lands of her village combined. It was however, what stood so incredibly in the centre of crater that had stolen the air from her lungs. Towering so high that its apex vanished in the clouds, stood the mighty obsidian black fortress of Fel Jardine.<br><br>This was the living heart of these Amazon women, thought Sharn as she stared in wonder at the impossible structure. It jutted up from the crater floor like a living extension of the land around it. The base of the fortress was ringed with a moat of burning red rock, steam like vapours rising up and obscuring the lower levels. Buttresses, towers, windows and battlements pock marked the surface of the fortress, some situated at impossible angels.<br><br>It hurts to look at, Sharn thought as a sharp pain filled her mind. Coupled with the raw wound on the back of her head, the effect was making her nauseous. The air of the crater that had once seemed so fresh after the cloying mixture of the tunnel now seemed oppressive. A sense of dread flowed through her as they started around the large spiralling ramp that led downwards to the carter floor. The fortress was still many miles distance but it seemed disturbingly too close as if the laws of nature were being twisted some how.<br><br>Sharn shivered uncontrollably in the saddle although the air was warm. Behind her Felquest offered her no comfort, remaining silent as they rode. A feeling of oppression and malevolence filled through Sharn's body snapping at her strength. Her shivering continuing even as the temperature rose as they neared the river of fire at the crater bottom. In the end Sharn blacked out, welcoming the darkness of oblivion to that of the sight of the nearing fortress. She woke to her body being given a hard shake as she blinked awake to see Felquest standing over her.<br><br>At least she isn't peeing over my face again, thought Sharn. Suddenly her thoughts became focused. The fortress now towered above her. They were now at the gates to the entrance. Behind them lay a long bridge of black stone running over the moat of fire. The dark sensations she had been filling her mind before came hammering back. It was almost like a physical blow. The fortress screamed an insult to every good thing she believed in, it's every pore, nook and cranny seemingly steeped in evil.<br><br>Sharn voided her bladder with the overwhelming horror of it all. Hot urine flowed down her naked legs as she squirted her piss uncontrollably from her pussy. She collapsed into a ball on the floor drawing into a foetal position trying desperately to shut out the obscenity of the outside world. She was still pissing, unaware of it even as her warm urine sprayed over her closed thighs. Suddenly a strong pair of hands grabbed her and roughly forced to her feet. Sharn could barely stand. The oppression that radiated outwards from the fortress was too much.<br><br>The hands found her again and pushed her forwards. A new set of hands grabbed her roughly and pulled her onwards, crossing the threshold and entering into the dark shadow of the fortresses mouth. The effect was like a curtain being lifted from around her senses. Suddenly everything was normal again and Sharn blinked in the dim torchlight coming from the walls.<br><br>Looking around she desperately searched for Felquest but there was no sign. Instead a score of warrior woman stood around her, their pussies on proud display and a look of disgust upon their faces. Two of them were stood by her side and Sharn realised that they were still holding her. She tried to shake them off but their hold on her was too strong. A loud bell sounded in the distance and the two warriors started forwards dragging Sharn with them. All around, the other warrior women parted to give them way. Sharn stared in wonder at the display of all the tanned bare backsides and triangular shaped pussies that were on display.<br><br>Finally looking forwards Sharn realised she was being taken to along flight of stairs that led upwards into shadows. It was as she followed these stairs upwards that she first saw the monster. It was sitting there at the top of the steps waiting for her. Shadows danced over its flesh whilst its large unblinking bibulous eyes stared down at her. She was dragged forwards and thrown unceremoniously into a heap on the stairs. Looking up Sharn saw the creature move and she screamed with all her might as it came to claim her.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 5</i></p>`,
      6: `<h2>Chapter 5: Besieged</h2><p>No one was surprised when the city of Delait became besieged by the forces of the Fel. For the past several months word and rumour had been spreading along the coast of the unstoppable force sweeping down from the north. The tales of beautiful warrior women and their strange tastes was on the lips of all those who dwelt within the city's taverns. Nobody was even sure just how much of the stories held any real truth. Envoys sent to the North had been returned as headless corpses, their clothes reeking of a distasteful familiar smell. Now finally, the vanguard of the Amazon army had arrived just before sunset the day before. Over the course of the night, the camp fires had continued to swell in number as the besieging army arrived in full might.<br><br>It was dawn now. The first red beams of sunlight were crossing the distant horizon and banishing the night's dark gloom. In a run down room on the first floor of the 'Friendly Banshee'; a disrespectable Tavern located in the seedy Western Quarter, a form was stirring from his sleep.<br><br>Tan Slander awoke. As his eyes flickered open to reveal the grey hazy outlines of the tavern's guest room, a sharp pain washed through his head. Blinking rapidly in an attempt to regain his sight he sat up. Promptly he regretted the action. The ache in his head took on a new magnitude; a piecing lance through his skull.<br><br>'Damn Solgen wine!' he cursed under his breath. Closing his eyes he took several deep breaths and tried again. This time the pain was not as intense but the room had taken on a disturbing rotation as his vision swam. Eyes closed again and then more deep breaths. Struggling out of the bed he fell to the wooden floor with a loud thump. Gaining his feet he stood, eyes still locked tight. His head continued to pound. With a grimace he forced one eye open. This time the room retained a little more of its stationary stature. 'That was good - now for the next eye.' More pain washed in into his pounding skull as he let in more of the dull light of the room's illumination which was provided by the solitary window on the far wall. A cold draught was blowing in from behind its rough cloth curtain and Tan took a deep lungful, his thoughts steadying as he did so.<br><br>In some confusion, his intense hangover nullifying his memory, he stared in confusion at the naked female form lying in his bed. Strands of raven black hair fell around the girl's shoulders, her bare creamy skin exposed for him to see. Blinking rapidly he tried to recall the night before. A vague memory of a substantial amount of wine came back to him and then a slight recollection of this naked beauty. 'That was it - The Landlord's daughter!' It was all starting to come back to Tan. As he had sunk under the influence of the drink the night before, he had started to tell one of his famous stories of how he was a famous warrior, a slayer of fell beasts and saviour of womenfolk. His audience had lapped it up no doubt aided by the influence of the very same liquor he had been drinking. What Tan lacked in honesty he more than made up with his ability to spin a good yarn. By the end of the night, the drinks had become free as had the company of this young creature as well.<br><br>Tan stared at her lovely form. She was lying on her side, her black strands hiding her pretty face from view. One breast and an exposed nipple were clearly visible as were the wide curves of her uncovered bum cheeks. Even in his sorry state Tan felt the beginnings of an erection starting to form. He made a move back to the bed eager to rejoin his companion but a new wave of pain and nausea stabbed up from his stomach. Reeling away from the bed he headed for the solitary table adjacent to the crumbling plaster of the nearby wall. Ignoring the dirty plates he grabbed the single clay jar and raised it to his mouth. Cold tepid water filled his throat and he forced himself to down the entire contents in one motion. The jar fell to the floor where it instantly shattered into a large number of fragments. Tan ignored the damage as his body was raked with a new wave of pain. Gasping he drew aside the thin curtain and stared out on the world outside.<br><br>The 'Friendly Banshee' had been built in the early days of the city when the money from trade from the North had been plentiful. As such it had once been a grand affair, situated on the top of a once grassy knoll. As the years passed, the knoll became a more crowed location. New premises were built side by side degenerating rapidly as the city's fortunes fell. Now the tavern found itself in the middle of a shanty town. The only thing that had not changed over the years was the commanding view from the upper storey.<br><br>If there was ever a sight to sober a man it was one of a besieging army of semi-naked, tanned Amazon goddesses waiting ready to slit your throat. Tan stared in half horror and half sexual thrill as he took on the sight of the army encamped around the city's walls. Sunlight bounced off highly polished armour, glinting in the rays of the rising sun. The ranks of the Fel were arranged in box formations, thousands strong. The distance was too great for Tan to make out the sight of the uncovered pussies arrayed before the cities walls but he knew well from the tales that where the armour ended at the women's waist, nudity took over. He wondered what it would be like to face one of these creatures in battle, his lust distracting his attention causing him to stare at the woman's groin rather than her blade. Maybe this is why they had been so successful? Who could blame any man for not fighting at his best when confronted with a woman's naked cunt?<br><br>He also wondered also if the stories were true about what they did to those they spared. If correct then these women liked nothing more than to hose down their victims with a strong gushing squirt of hot piss flowing out of their pussy lips. Closing his eyes Tan wondered what if would be like to receive such a shower. Fine, they might slit his throat afterwards but it might almost be worth it!<br><br>A distant shout from the city walls below caught his attention. A lone commander dressed in the bright red colours of the Elite City Guard was directing runners away from his location on the high Eastern tower. The runners spread themselves out along the battlements as they each reached a section of the waiting troops that filled the tops of the walls. Instructions given, the runners then stood back from the troops at the battlements. Tan watched on now intently interested on the proceedings below. Outside of the city the Fel waited in their battle formations, silently watching the proceedings on the walls. Overhead the call from a bird of prey split the air. Tan looked up trying to spot the source of the sound but then came the trumpet call from the Eastern Tower. Instantly looking back down at the walls Tan watched on in amazement as a vast shuffling came from the hundreds of soldiers lining the walls. One by one sword belts, armour and leggings fell to the ground as the troops literally let down their trousers. Tan stared in disbelief. Was it their intent to fight the enemy in the same half dressed manner as their foe? Another blast from the trumpet and a large smile formed on Tan's weathered face.<br><br>On the battlements each soldier manning the wall was now in the process of taking a piss. Up and over the edge of the battlements shot this vast multitude of golden showers; each arc flowing up into the sky before cresting downwards over the wall's edge and to the barren earth below. Tan felt like personally congratulating the Elite Commander in person at his shear audacity. What a brilliant insult to his foes! To use the very manner in which they subdued their vanquished as a means of signalling the city's defiance. Eagerly Tan's gaze fell back to the enemy wanting to take in their reaction. The Fel remained unmoved, still silent and watchful as several hundred streams of golden urine arced out of the city walls to the dusty ground below. Tan wondered how the Commander would fare when the city fell and he was dragged in front of the enemy leader. What would be their response to this day's spectacle?<br><br>As the streams of piss being sent over the wall by the city defenders began to wane and vanish, another trumpet blast split the air. This time it came from amongst the massed ranks of the Fel waiting outside. As one, the besieging army came to life, advancing on the city walls. Immediately the troops on the walls started to panic; a mass of disorganised men desperately trying to redress. The arrows started to fly, let loose by the Fel archers now in range. The dying started as a deadly black rain descended upon the walls. Men still struggling to get back into their pants fell as arrows lanced down amongst them. The runners in the walls were active again, dashing back towards the Tower for new instructions just as a fresh batch departed to relay new orders to the disorganised troops. Briefly Tan wondered why there was so little sign of other commanders upon the walls to bestow order but then he remembered the city's politics and the ongoing reduction in the city's defence budget. It had been the misplaced conception that Delait would never fall whilst the much larger city port of Pelt held the strategic port on the northwest coast. This had all been based on the fact that any enemy raiding force would come by way of a sea born invasion. No one had every suspected that the blasted north lands held such a dark and terrible secret as these Fel warrior women.<br><br>Tan held no illusion that the city guard could save the city. Delait was doomed and it was now the more important matter of fleeing the sinking ship before it was too late. His headache cleared by the fresh air and the events unfolding below, Tan turned back to survey the room. The sleeping beauty on his bed lay undisturbed, her body lifting ever so with the rhythm of her breathing. Tan desperately wished he could recall bedding her as he was no longer in any fit state now. The realisation of the coming slaughter had stolen his erection coupled with that of a growing burning sensation in his bladder. Looking around he searched for the room's piss pot. Spying it under the bed he advanced towards it but stopped suddenly as he arrived at the bed's timber frame. An incredibly naughty idea had stolen into his head most likely created by the sights outside the window. Lifting his long limp member in his right hand he aimed the tip of his dick in the direction of the straw mattress and the sleeping girl upon it. Without a conscious effort the burning need in his bladder started to sweep down to his waiting penis. Barely a moment passed and his piss reached its exit point. Instantly a bright yellow stream of urine erupted from his cock and started to spray into the space above the bed. His golden pee shower immediately formed a flowing arc in the air, strong and thick in its intensity. As the piss continued to leave his dick it descended earthwards drawn by gravity's pull. Within moments the first of his piss landed on the bed and its sleeping occupant. Tan watched on with a growing thrill and wonder as his piss pattered over the bare flesh of the naked body of Tavern owner's daughter. This was a fantastic thrill!, he thought aiming his piss stream up and down the girl's skin watching the way it ran off her bare flesh and onto the straw mattress. Amazingly she hadn't woken - the depth of her sleep fuelled by the drink of the night before. Wishing to take full advantage of this opportunity Tan raised his dick upwards into the air see the arc of his shooting piss stream rising as he did so. The impact point of his golden shower rose accordingly along the graceful lines of the sleeping girl. Hot piss was now splattering around the top of her shoulders, small golden streams running down and around her form. Suddenly she stirred in her sleep moaning slightly as the golden shower of Tan's piss continued to rain down over her naked flesh.<br><br>For a moment Tan thought she was about to wake but instead she simply rolled over hands sprawling to the edges of the bed as she did so. Tan could not believe his luck. She had now presented her entire nude front to his still spraying dick stream. Eagerly he played his piss shower over the girl's ample bosom taking great delight in seeing his pee cascading down over her brown nipples. The sight of the girls matted triangle of curly pubic hairs nestled between her legs caught Tan's gaze and slowly he lowered his dick bringing the focus of his pee stream down the girl's belly. Yellow pee bounced out of her belly button as his yellow shower descended and within moments Tan was pissing strongly into the girl's bush. The sheer thrill of being able to piss over this sleeping girl was being to excite Tan even through the stupor of his hangover. He could feel his cock hardened in his hand as he stood there pissing over the nude girl for all he was worth. As the force of his golden shower diminished the harder his cock became. As soon as the last drops of piss had fallen from the end of his member he started to pump his dick with both hands, his eyes firmly focused on the pee stained beauty in the bed. He could never remember being so turned on and within seconds he had passed his threshold; shooting his white cum all over the bed and its sleeping occupant.<br><br>Utterly drained Tan collapsed panting to the floor. What an incredible experience that had been. He fought to control his breathing feeling the rhythm of his beating chest slowly returning to normal. Collecting his thoughts he realised that his hangover seemed to have passed. Looking down his body and the state he was in, he decided it was time to get moving. After all, the city was under attack and he desperately needed a plan which involved leaving Delait as soon as possible.<br><br>Dressing quickly in his leather pants and woollen tunic he quickly pulled on his well worn black boots. Donning his chain mail vest he attached his sword to his belt ensuring that the weapon slipped easily from its holder. He had a dark suspicion that his life would soon be depending upon it. Stopping by the door he took one last wistful look at the piss stained bed and its still sleeping occupant. Part of him wanted nothing more than to top up his bladder and repeat his earlier performance; taking a new piss up and down this sleeping beauty. However common sense was urging him to quickly vacate the 'Friendly Banshee' as quickly as possible and never return. Slipping out the door he closed it quietly behind him. It would not be a good thing for the girl to awake now and discover what he had done. Descending the stairs he was startled by a loud shout issuing from the kitchen door.<br><br>"Tan. Off to slay some Fel women? A good day to die I wager" the Tavern's landlord said as he emerged from the gloom of the kitchen doorway.<br><br>"Er, yes" stammered Tan. 'My, this fellow was a big brute' he thought. "I'm off to the battlements straight away" he continued trying to regain his resolve.<br><br>"Well don't you worry about me or my Kalrin. Anybody coming through that door today is going to be introduced to my little friend here" the landlord said suddenly lifting an enormous club into sight.<br><br>Tan gulped. He doubted he would be even able to lift the weapon with both hands let alone swing it with just the one. 'Who in the seven hells was Kalrin? Ah, she must be his daughter. Gods above ‚Äì he'd slept with the girl and he hadn't even known her name.'<br><br>Suddenly a muffled scream came from the floor above. 'Oh he was for it now. Kalrin had obviously awoke and discovered what he had done to her.<br><br>"I best be off" Tan said with a nervous look at the stairs expecting at any second the naked form of the Landlord's daughter to appear and point him out as the culprit of the crime.<br><br>"Wait a minute. What was that scream? Kalrin? Kalrin are you are alright". The Landlord hurried for the stairs. Seeing his opportunity, Tan crossed the remaining distance to the Tavern door. As the Landlord pounded up the stairs, club waving up and down in the one hand, Tan slid it open and made good his exit. The door was just sliding shut when an almighty bellow came from above.<br><br>Tan had never run so fast before in his life. At breakneck speed he dashed through the unusually quiet streets, his feet pounding on the cobbles. At the bottom of the knoll he took the first alleyway and fled into its welcoming gloom. His heart was pounding, more from fear than from the exertion of his flight. He had visions of the burly Landlord fighting his way through legions upon legions of Fel women just to get to him. 'That had definitely best not happen' he told himself as he rounded another corner. The suns rays had not yet to risen high enough to illuminate his surroundings and he immediately ploughed into a stack of barrels sending both them and Tan flying in a loud clamour. He landed heavily on the cold floor rolling out of instinct which saved his life as a heavy barrel smashed down to where he had been bare moments before. Gaining his feet he groggily looked around and was just in time to see an indistinct figure appearing out of the thick shadows before a blow to his temple plunged him into a well of blackness.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 6</i></p>`,
      7: `<h2>Chapter 6: Flight Into Darkness</h2><p>Sounds of battle woke Tan from the inky darkness of oblivion. As he came slowly back to his senses he was aware of a great number of different things clamouring for attention. First off was the unbelievable pain radiating through his skull Secondly, was the worrying sound of people dying not too far away. Thirdly and almost unnoticeably at this stage was the strange contrast between hot and cold his body seemed to be subjected to.<br><br>He was dimly aware of being laid upon his back which was deeply chilled whilst his front was bathed in a soothing light of warm rays. As his brain started to struggle back into cognitive reasoning, he asserted the fact that he was lying on the cold cobbles of the alleyway now illuminated by the morning sun which had climbed high into the morning sky.<br><br>Then it hit him ‚Äì he was naked, as bare as the day he entered into the world. This was why he was feeling such a contrast in the temperature; he no longer wore his clothes! Blinking rapidly, desperately trying to focus on the world around him, Tan stared down at his bare body, chest hairs, limp penis and his long legs, which were all uncovered. With a groan of pain as he struggled into a sitting position and desperately tried to recall his last waking moments. Suddenly with a wash of nausea it came back to him. One minute he had been running through the alley, the next he had been attacked. Obviously this had not been the father of the lovely and somewhat piss covered bar maid of the night before, or he would not have woken at all.<br><br>Tan stared around at the bare stones and broken remains of wooden barrels that lay around him in the sun drenched alleyway. There wasn't a sign of any of his belongings. Clothes, weapon and money had all vanished. Another groan escaped his lips, this time one of frustration. What could be worse than a thief being robbed by another thief?<br><br>Blinking back the pain in his head where he had been hit, Tan struggled to his feet. The sounds of fighting seemed to be getting closer. A woman's scream died halfway through, louder and more piercing than that of the cries of the men that surrounded it. Tan shuddered at the sound, his predicament now even more precarious. A naked man stood little chance of surviving in a city in its death throes. What should he do?<br><br>Acute stress affects people in different ways. Fortunately for Tan, his brain remained calm and immediately dropped into a calculating mode efficiently running through his options. Many years as a professional thief had taught him to be cool under pressure and to quickly assess escape routes and exit means.<br><br>Within seconds he was in motion, his bare feet making no sound as they dashed across the cobbles. In his mind's eye he could see his position within the city, dedication to his art providing him with a means of escape. At the end of the alleyway he darted back into welcoming darkness of the shadows cast by a large merchant building. The road was deserted and Tan quickly made his way down its length until reaching the intersection.<br><br>The sound of fighting had diminished during his mad naked dash, but now new sounds of steel clashing against steel rose loudly from down the adjoining street. Peeking round the brickwork corner, Tan stared at the sight of the combatants. A score of city guards were fighting desperately for their lives outclassed easily by a handful of Amazon Fel warriors.<br><br>Tan watched with a growing thrill as he observed the luscious half naked beauties fighting their foes. Lithe and nimble on their feet, unencumbered by heavy steel armour like their opponents, they were literally dancing circles around the guards, sending quick and lethal jabs into their midst. Tan was mesmerised. Another attribute of a good thief was that of keen eyesight. Even from this distance Tan could clearly make out the lovely curves of the bare buttocks on display as well as the various shapes and colours of the Amazon pussies.<br><br>As he watched, one raven haired warrior managed to dislodge two guards from their defensive formation and parried them into the street away from their comrades. Quickly she dealt with the first guard after blocking an attack from his associate. Tan's eyes were too busily focused on her matt of black curly hairs nestled between her toned and tanned legs to witness the death blow. However as the guard's head rolled into the gutter away from the bleeding corpse he immediately looked up, trying to focus and analyse the woman's fighting style.<br><br>The second guard managed to put up a better resistance than his deceased associate but within seconds he was disarmed by the deadly Amazon facing him. His sword clattered to the stone floor several paces away and Tan watched with a growing horror as the guard faced his cold blooded death. To both his and guard's surprise, the killing stroke never came. Instead the beautiful woman warrior took a pace forward and back handed the guard full in the face with the hilt of her blood stained sword. The guard collapsed to the ground as if his legs had been swept away.<br><br>Within seconds the Amazon beauty was upon him, straddling his dented armoured body and bringing her uncovered pussy to within a scant breath away from his bruised face. Although Tan had heard the legends and fantasized about the myth, it will still a shock to see the woman start to send a thick yellow squirt of her gushing pee straight into the direction of the guard's mouth. He spluttered and tried to resist but she simply moved the tip of her blade to his exposed throat whilst she continued to submit him to her spraying pussy shower. Her flowing urine stream looked like molten gold in the rays of the burning sun and for a scant moment Tan was envious of the stricken guard.<br><br>What a turn on it would be to have such a beauty let loose with her hot pussy spray all over your face, revelling in its warmth as she pissed and pissed from her gorgeous pee hole. The warrior woman's gushing pee stream was already beginning to wane as she finished relieving her pussy over her fallen prey. Behind her, the sounds of fighting were also fading as the other warrior women finished their work.<br><br>Tan wished desperately to know if they too were going to take a pee over their beaten adversaries but he knew time was running out. The raven haired warrior had finished her toilet over the guard and was beginning to stand up. Her buttocks looked stunning and Tan was sure he had never witnessed such a finely toned and pert female backside. Focus! He must focus! It was hard to do, but Tan managed to avert his gaze from the luscious warrior and instead scan the floor of the intersection for his goal.<br><br>There it was, the metal man cover than led downwards to the city sewers and Tan's only means of escape. Taking one quick look at the female warriors up the street, he darted for the cover. He prayed that it would open quickly as he dived towards it, doing a barrel roll as he hit the cobbled street, bouncing up and onto the large plate cover. Fingers bit into the dirt around the metal seeking for leverage. The sewer cover was heavy but sheer adrenaline drove him on. He was terribly aware that his naked body was now in full view down the street from the warrior Fel. He had scant moments before they would surely notice him.<br><br>At last, the cover shifted as his muscles strained. With a deep sigh of old stale air, the metal lid gave way and Tan lifted it clear of the opening. Behind him came a shout from a female throat. Discovery! Tan scrabbled forwards sending his legs into the dark yawning hole in front of him. Every sense cried out a warning. Turn. Look. See how far their blades are from your back, but Tan ignored them desperately struggling to align his body into the hole and its promise of freedom. With one final push he shoved his upper torso towards the blackness and let gravity take hold of him pulling him downwards. As he fell he heard a female voice cursing in a strange tongue scant paces from where he had been only moments ago.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 7</i></p>`,
      8: `<h2>Chapter 7: Initiation</h2><p>Piss! Sharn was convinced that the Fel were obsessed with it. It had now been a whole month since her arrival at Fel Jardine and her induction into the ways of the Fel was still ongoing. The most overriding feature of her ongoing ordeal was the Amazon women's attitude to relieving themselves. Basically, it seemed that you should pee as much as possible and in any manner or location you wished. The fortress was riddled with an astonishing sewerage system which performed the task of collecting of spent bodily fluids with an amazing versatility. The very walls and structures within the massive fortress were built from a material with a very low frictional threshold. This fact coupled with the Fel's need to piss everywhere was probably one of the factors why the warriors went around naked from the waist down. Plus any kind of footwear would be lethal on the slippery floor ways that lined the dark corridors and walk spaces around the foreboding structure.<br><br>Further to Sharn's initial thoughts about her capturers, the concept of pissing as a way of life had been further compelled by her lesbian lover, the girl called Felquest. During their frequent love making sessions Felquest would love to squirt her hot bodily warmed urine shower all over Sharn's naked form. Sharn always had the opportunity to repay this kind of treatment in kind, watching whilst she squirted her golden piss stream all over her lover's body. The only taboo rule was that neither of them could drink from the other's pee stream.<br><br>Felquest had gone onto to explain one night as they lay exhausted in each other's arms on top of Felquest large bed. Their bodies were covered with sweat and spent piss, both of which were cooling as the air in the chamber leached away the heat. Giggling like young girls the two of them had re-embraced in a warm cuddle, breasts rubbing against breasts and their matted pussy hairs close against the others. Felquest had told her then of the ritual of the Fel in their special way of imposing servitude and dominance. To piss in another person's mouth, the Fel believed, was a way in subverting the soul of the receiver and binding it with invisible chains to service in the name of the Dark Ones. This was the name given to the Fel gods.<br><br>Naturally, most outsiders not belonging to the Fel subjected to this ritual had little idea of this bounding ritual involved. This was unfortunate as any sign of resistance following on from this act was dealt with in a most savage and brutal fashion. The offender would immediately be cut down and the slain body ripped to shreds for all to witness.<br><br>Chilled by this description Sharn had shuddered uncontrollably inside Felquest's warm arms. A hot kiss, full on the lips, had both calmed and excited her at the same time. Immediately Sharn had responded, her passion fuelled once again by her lover's kiss and within moments they were busily fucking once again.<br><br>Later a thoroughly exhausted Sharn had curled up inside the deer-skin bed sheets and listened to Felquest's voice whilst being on the brink of sleep. She had explained then why Sharn had not yet been subjected to the Ritual of Claiming when one of the Fel women would claim her as her own. At this stage Sharn would have no choice but to except the golden stream of piss being squirted into her open mouth. Failure to drink this hot gushing spray would result in a horrible death. On the other hand, her acceptance of this gift would result in her official placement inside the Fel warrior ranks.<br><br>Now back on her uncomfortable bunk inside the rooms belonging to the assortment of captured prisoners, Sharn thought further on her predicament. Since the day she had fainted at the bottom of the stairs in the entrance hallway of the fortress, Sharn had been forced to live in the small confines of this prison. Her horror at the hideous shape on the stairs had sent her reeling into darkness only to be dumped unceremoniously on a stone floor in the prison area. She had been woken by a multitude of warm wet streams of piss spraying over her naked body as a collection of captured girls had seen the opportunity to pee over her whilst unconscious. She had woken in a fury fuelled even more so by the discovery that these weren't armoured Fel warriors abusing her as a receptacle for their toilet, rather than a group of fellow captured girls taken from their homes across the land.<br><br>Spluttering with the piss running around from the back of her head and onto her face, Sharn had rolled over, kicking furiously at the legs of one girl who was still busily urinating over all over her. The girl had gone down, her fountain of pee vanishing from her brown haired muff as she fell. Within seconds Sharn was on her feet in a fighting stance facing the assortment of girls now grouped around her. Two of the girls were still peeing; their thick golden squirts of piss flowing in fast moving fountains of urine down to the floor between their legs.<br><br>Sharn was ready for pouncing on the nearest girl when suddenly a strong commanding voice came from behind her. Wheeling around Sharn discovered a tall Fel warrior half dressed in the usual Fel manner of polished steel armour. The woman was half as tall again as Sharn, the shape of her large bosom and hardened nipples beautifully intimidated by the metal of her breast plate. Between the woman's legs, a thick forest of dark brown pubic hairs covered the sight of her pussy slit from sight.<br><br>Not giving Sharn the time to react, the woman strode forward delivering a backhanded slap across Sharn's face which sent her reeling across the hard floor. She landed heavily, her bare skin offering no protection from the impact. Before she had even time to recover the Fel woman was upon her. Strong hands twisted her around and within seconds a new hot gushing spray of fast moving piss was shooting into Sharn's hair.<br><br>Sharn tried to wriggle free of her capturer's embrace but the grip was too strong. In utter misery Sharn was forced to continue the subjection whilst the warrior emptied her bladder's supply of pee all over the back of her head. In the background she could hear the other girls laughing as they watched on. From the corner of her eye she could just make out the sight of one girl still enjoying a piss of her own all over the floor.<br><br>As Sharn's hair had filled with Fel piss, a warm stream of urine ran down her bare back and over her bum cheeks. Her heart had filled with an ice cold resolve. Hate was filling her soul as golden pee continued to flow across her flesh. 'How they will all pay for this.' she vowed, mumbling a silent prayer to her goddess at the same time.<br><br>Finally the warrior woman's toilet came to an end. As she finished her piss the Amazon Fel pushed Sharn forwards, sending her face down onto the cold floor. Sharn made no move to arise, her humiliation complete. A large damp puddle surrounded her, created by the warrior's pee shower, the warmth of the piss the only welcoming sensation in her current predicament.<br><br>Sharn had been left alone then, the group of young female warriors and their charge departing for another room. She had laid on the floor until the chill of the now cold piss puddle finally drove her to action. Arising slowly from the stone tiles, droplets of pee running off from her hair and skin, she surveyed her current surroundings. The room was cold and grey, the walls and floor made from a slick dull stone. Taking a step forward Sharn had been surprised by just how smooth the floor had been and for once she was grateful for her nudity and bare feet. Further examination of the room revealed several doorways leading off in several directions as if her current location was a hub for a nexus for several other rooms.<br><br>The sound of running water coming from one such doorway had finally tempted Sharn to explore. The door glided open at her touch with surprising ease. What was even more interesting was the view inside. A large open area filled with sunlight flooding in from tall open windows many feet above was filled with a large pool of crystal clear water. A waterfall tumbled from an outlet in the ceiling and fell in a twisting stream to impact into the main body of water below. The overflow from the pool simply washed over the surround pool wall and ran over the floor before vanishing through a myriad of small holes in the stone tiles.<br><br>Moving into the room Sharn discovered that the water was heated, its warm touch passing over her feet as she neared the pool. Putting a hand into the pool water she discovered that it was just at the right temperature for bathing and without hesitation she had slipped into its warm embrace. It had felt so wonderful to wash off the pee stains she had received and for the first time in a long while, Sharn began to feel clean.<br><br>Sharn's bath lasted for quite some time. Nobody came searching for her so she simply relaxed and enjoyed herself. Memories of bathing with her sister at home came flooding back and she recalled, with a growing sadness, the fun times they had enjoyed together. Had they ever had known how others used their pee streams to subjugate others, then Sharn was certain that they would have never had played their pee games. Having a naughty wee into the bath tub whilst their mother wasn't looking was one thing. However to have a full blown piss over another human was another matter entirely.<br><br>A salty tear had run down Sharn's cheek at that moment as she felt the loss once against of her family. It was at that moment that she made her vow. She would find, what ever it took, a way to hurt these Fel woman with their strange rituals of peeing over others. She could feel the rage welling up inside her as she remembered her own failure to defend the village and her resulting humiliation at the hands of the warrior women.<br><br>"I will paint my soul scarlet in the blood of these women!" Sharn had stated out loud to the empty room. The constant sound of the splashing water was her only reply. For a moment Sharn wondered if her goddess could hear her prayers coming as they were, from inside this nightmare place. Shaking her head to dispel her doubts Sharn clambered out of the warm water. Squatting down on the pool's edge she parted her legs and gazed down at the sight of her pussy hovering over the lapping water. Within seconds Sharn was having a pee of her own. From the base of her vagina shot a hot stream of golden urine which sprayed into the bath water. Sharn could clearly see her pee stream as it passed through the outer skin of the pool water before mingling inside.<br><br>Peeing into the bath water that she was sure the other girls would later be using, seemed a small revenge for the way they had pissed all over her earlier. At least it was a start. By now, Sharn was fully determined in her resolve to exact her revenge against all those who had treated her in such a shameful manner. Continuing her piss into the waters Sharn fantasized about the ways and means she would exact revenge. Meanwhile the lovely feeling of relief flooded through her bladder as her golden pee stream continued to squirt strongly from her pussy and into the lapping blue water.<br><br>From behind, anybody entering the room would clearly be able to see the thick golden squirt of piss flowing from Sharn's naked pussy. The flowing stream pattered down into the pool water just in front of her round bare bum cheeks. Fortunately Sharn's toilet was not discovered and slowly her stream of piss had dwindled before vanishing. Clambering down from her pissing position, Sharn descended to the floor. With one last wistful look at the pee contaminated pool she decided it would be a good a time as any to leave.<br><br>All this of course was all past history. From there on in, Sharn had discovered her place amongst the captured girls. Each one of them represented a different village, their homes ranging from the base of the giant mountains that hid Fel Jardine from the rest of the world, to the grass lands south of the city of Trimilarn-Del-Felor. One girl in particular whose skin was a much paler shade than the others, heralded from a town on the distant shores of the Shirael sea, a place far away in the east. This was many leagues away from Sharn's home and she remembered the shudder of fear that had run down her spine at the news. The Fel's invasion of her homelands was one thing, but the news of their attacks spreading out across the entire land was shocking. Where were the King's armies? When would this invasion be halted and their rescue arrive?<br><br>The girls it seemed were to be trained in the ways of the warrior, each one of them pitted against the other. There would be no friends found here as only one of them would survive the coming ordeal. It seemed that the Fel intended to use them for entertainment, their fights to the death witness by the highest council of the ruling elite. It appeared that there were many such similar groups of captured girls in the fortress, each one with the same task of finding a champion. These surveying girls would in turn be granted the honour of joining the ranks of the Fel, each of them subjugated by a leading Amazon warrior.<br><br>Sharn had no desire to become anybody's slave but for the same token so had no desire to die. As it was, the day of her first competition fight soon arrived. She had been led through winding corridors and down endless stairs by 'Taliltarn' the tall Amazon who had been responsible for their training so far. Sharn followed the woman's naked swaying buttocks as she led the way. Sharn simply couldn't help herself. As much as she would quite happily slay the bitch where she stood, there was simply something so desirable about the woman's firm bum cheeks. Even as Sharn was led through the maze of passages on her way to the arena she found herself fantasying about licking Talitarn's pussy before bringing her lips to the woman's hardened nipples.<br><br>Suddenly they came to an abrupt stop and Sharn nearly walked straight into the back of her tutor. Catching herself she took a step back and took note of her surroundings, finally wresting her gaze from the tall woman's exposed private parts. Two equally tall Fel Amazons stood either side of a large foreboding door made from a dark wood and pitted with spikes. It looked evil. The sudden chill from the surrounding stone walls suddenly seemed to leach the warmth from Sharn's flesh.<br><br>A loud pattering sound coming from her right made Sharn quickly look to the source. The warrior woman on that side had chosen that particular moment to start to piss. From the base of her curly brown haired vagina was now squirting a fast flowing stream of golden pee, which arched downwards to splatter on the stone tiles below. Nobody else even seemed to have noticed the guard's sudden desire to relieve herself over the floor. Sharn suppressed an urge to giggle. The woman had a lovely pussy and one Sharn would happily love to explore with her tongue given the chance. However to see the woman simply start to pee just in time for the arrival of Sharn and Taliltarn was almost comical.<br><br>Trying as best she could to ignore the spectacle of the woman's toilet going on to one side, Sharn did her best to focus on the conversation Taliltarn was involved with the second guard. The language of the Fel was a hard one to master being extremely guttural in pronunciation and Sharn had only mastered a few basic words. The patter of female pee being sprayed over the floor to her side did not make things any easier and Sharn felt her attention drifting back to watching the guard's pee splattering all over the floor.<br><br>The Amazon's pussy shower was still in full flow, the stream of piss escaping her vagina showing no sign of abating. The woman in question, had her gazed locked on a point down the corridor, somewhere over Sharn's right shoulder. This presented a wonderful opportunity for Sharn to enjoy the show. As her hot pee stream squirted through the air it was caught in the torch light and seemed to become a flow of liquid gold forming a running fountain to the floor below. Sharn was desperately tempted to have a quick pee of her own. She would love nothing more than to join the woman's flowing urine shower with a stream of hot piss gushing from her own pussy. The idea of having their streams come together in mid flight and the resulting mess on the floor below was an intoxicating fantasy and one Sharn was finding harder to resist.<br><br>The loud creaking of the door being opened brought Sharn back to her senses. Shaking her head and looking away from the peeing woman she followed Taliltarn into the new room. A crescendo of noise washed over her as she passed the threshold and emerged into the base of a large circular pit. Looking up she was shock to discover the watching multitude gathered in the tiers of seating location high above. There must have been over a hundred Fel in this chamber.<br><br>A sharp push from behind sent Sharn reeling, her fantasies forgotten, and she plunged headlong into the brightly light arena. Blinking rapidly she was horrified to discover that her opponent was already stood in the arena. With a confident sneer on her pretty face, the girl known as Gherian gave Sharn a dismissive look. Sharn's heart lurched. The girl was a killer, pure and simple. Her skill with the wooden swords they had used in training so far was more than enough for Sharn to known she was easily outclassed. This was quite probably the day she would die.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 8</i></p>`,
      9: `<h2>Chapter 8: The Sewers of Delait</h2><p>A loud splash accompanied Tan's descent into the chilled water of the city sewers. As he broke the surface, the strong current was already carrying him away and out of sight of the shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom from the sewer opening above. Gasping for air he tried to listen above the lapping waters for sound of another body dropping into the sewer. No splash came and Tan thanked his two favourite gods for his miraculous escape. A minute later and Tan was cursing the same two deities for his fate.<br><br>The sewer water was cold, numbingly so especially for an unclothed man such as Tan. Kicking his legs he tried to swim for the side wall which was hidden in the black veil of darkness that filled the sewer. Panting and swearing his hands found purchase on cold stonework and within moments Tan was pulling himself out of the frigid water with the last of his strength.<br><br>He lay awhile recovering his breath in the darkness, his body racked with shivers from the cold. From his livelihood as a professional thief and registered guild member he knew well the history of the sewers. The city was one of few to be graced with such a modern system which was fed from the easterly running river, the Lyax, as it descended from the mountains before joining the major seaward bound stretch of water which made up the Lythethic delta. As such the sewer system was fed with clear clean water as oppose to the muddied and silted river which ran through the city before emptying into the harbour.<br><br>Tan was well glad of that particular fact as he struggled once more to his feet. Probing with his hands in the darkness he traced the sewer wall upwards to a height just short of his full stature. Crouching to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling he felt the width of the stones at his feet. The distance proved to be more than adequate for a man to travel in safety and without the fear of plunging into the icy waters. Without any further delay Tan set off into the blackness, his body still racked with uncontrollable shivers from the cold.<br><br>After what seemed an age of travelling in the stygian darkness Tan finally saw a glimmer of light coming from up ahead. He had turned and twisted about on his course, always following the wall to the left whenever the sewer split and divided. He was also aware that he had been travelling uphill for quite some time and the level of water running beside him had dropped considerably. Judging by the sound it now made it was probably only as deep as his ankles but he had no desire to test his theory especially considering the purpose of the sewer system in the first place.<br><br>By now he had his shivering under control although he was still thoroughly cold and miserable. Part of him longed to go back and surrender to the beauty of the warrior Fel women and beg for them to cover him with their hot golden pee streams. At this moment in time he could think of nothing as so wonderful as being treated to a golden shower, a woman's urine spraying over his body sending its warmth permeating through his chilled flesh.<br><br>The water passing by his feet made little sound as it flowed silently over the sewer bed and Tan suddenly became aware of a new sound coming from up ahead. It was a light tinkling noise like that of wine being poured into a goblet and Tan rushed forwards to investigate. As he neared the veil of light piercing the gloom he was rewarded with the sight of a thin golden stream raining downwards from a shaft above.<br><br>Intrigued Tan edged forwards and looked upwards. He almost gasped out loud as for the second time that day Tan witnessed a woman relieving her pee. The shaft was a toilet shaft from a building above. Highlighted by the daylight around her, the woman's bum cheeks were easy to discern as was the gushing squirt of piss emanating from her pussy lips. The woman was obviously young and shapely judging by her fine peach like bum cheeks. Her pussy was covered with a mass of tight curly pubic hairs that fanned outwards as they rose between her creamy thighs.<br><br>Tan watched on enthralled, one hand caressing his growing cock as he watched the delightful display of this woman urinating. The toilet rim was not so far away and Tan reckoned that with a strong jump he would have been able to jump and touch the woman's muff. Instead he contented himself with offering his left hand out into the beam of light and into the flowing pee stream. As the warmth of the woman's pee flowed over his fingers Tan pumped faster and faster over his erect manhood. The woman was just finishing her wee with several last squirts of her honey stream when Tan's ejaculation erupted into the ray of light spilling down from above.<br><br>Gasping and trying to keep his ragged breathing from revealing his presence, Tan watched with disappointment as the woman's bum cheeks lifted up from the seat above before vanishing from sight. Taking time to compose himself, his recent masturbation having warmed him slightly, Tan decided that this would be as good as place as any to try and break free from his prison.<br><br>With the little amount of light that reached forth to the sewer walls, Tan was able to see enough to position himself in such a way as to boost himself upwards into the narrow toilet shaft. He immediately reached forth on both sides with his hands to stop him from sliding back down again. Escaping the toilet was not an easy affair but after all Tan was a thief and making his way through narrow obstacles was part of his daily life.<br><br>Barely five minutes latter and Tan collapsed on the polished marble floor of the toilet room interior. For a minute he lay on his back recovering from his ordeal, still drained from his recent masturbatory release. He closed his eyes shutting out the view of the ornately decorated ceiling and recalled the image of the pissing woman, enjoying relieving the sight of her bum and pussy in his mind.<br><br>Drifting further back into his somewhat usual day, he recalled the sight of the pissing warrior woman and he felt himself once again stir as he remembered the view offered to him as she had relieved her piss over the fallen guard. Her pee stream had flowed like molten gold in the sunlight as did her piss, subjecting her foe to the ultimate humiliation. The length of her pee had been brief but the size and strength of her pissing flow of urine had been unquestionable.<br><br>Tan was jolted from his fantasy by a noise from outside. Within seconds he had found his feet and was with his back against the wall by the wooden door that stood ajar into the toilet room. Peering through the crack by the unusually fine crafted upper hinge Tan starred in disbelief as two nubile young women emerged into view. Both were obviously younger than twenty year spans and were both equally and completely nude.<br><br>The girl on the right was a brunette with small but beautifully formed breasts and a completely hairless pussy. The deep groove of her pussy slit ran down between her thighs, her little clit just visible poking out at the top. By her side the second girl had blond hair but by the dark matt of pussy hairs between her legs it was obvious that this was not her natural colour. Her breasts were much larger than her friends, her large nipples surround by deep red coloured flesh. Tan felt his dick growing between his legs and he clutched his manhood with one hand. This was the last thing he needed. If either of the girls decided to use the toilet then he would be instantly discovered. What could be worse than being discovered clutching an erection?<br><br>The girls were giggling now at some private joke and they kept pushing each other away in a manner that only fuelled Tan's excitement.<br><br>"Shall we do it?" the fake blond asked her naked girlfriend.<br><br>"Yes let us do it now before the fighting stops and everybody returns," replied the brunette. Tan was mesmerised by the sight of her little clit poking out at the top of her slit. The tavern whores he was used to never shaved their pussies and this was proving to be a real education.<br><br>"You go first," the blond haired girl replied, waving her head from side to side causing her mane of golden strands to fall around her back.<br><br>"You promise to go next if I do this?" asked the first girl, her naked form looking like an angel from the heavens to the peeping man behind the door.<br><br>"Of course but hurry up in case somebody comes," the blond girl urged. She had moved round now presenting her back and wide round bum cheeks to Tan.<br><br>Giggling the brunette walked over to the ornate sink area which comprised of a continually flowing stream of water falling from a pipe jutting out of the mouth of a mosaic green fish adorning the wall. The water bounced and splashed into a large urn which proceeded to carry the water along to three separate wash basins before vanishing from sight. The young girl had by now clambered her lusciously curved nude form onto the sink area and was in the process of lowering her bare bum and shaved pussy down over the middle basin.<br><br>The blond girl laughed out loud and clapped when suddenly a squirt of clear coloured pee erupted from the naked pussy of her friend. Tan watched on with growing excitement as the stream of piss exiting the girl's vagina continued to grow in size and strength becoming a constantly flowing arch of golden urine down into the wash basin.<br><br>"You're doing it!" laughed the blond girl, stating the obvious. "What does it feel like?"<br><br>"So very, very naughty!" giggled the peeing brunette. The stream of piss leaving her pussy showed no sign of abating as it rained down into the sink bowl between her legs. Her gushing pee fountain continued to flow copiously from her bare pussy slit as she squirted her piss out of her bare vagina.<br><br>"Just like those Fel women" said the blond girl cupping her hands together and moving them up to the brunette's toilet spray.<br><br>"Sananara, you wouldn't dare?" giggled the peeing teenager. Her flowing shower of pussy relief wavered in the air as she laughed and the blond girl had to follow it around in the air until her hands entered her pee stream.<br><br>"I guess I would!" she laughed again watching as her cupped hands filled with her friend's pee stream. Once her hands were full of the brunette's piss she moved them out of the diminishing pee shower that was slowly reducing to a trickle from the shaved girl's pussy. Holding her hands above her head she suddenly uncapped them allowing their contents of spent pee to come raining down over her golden hair.<br><br>"Now I'm one of the Fel!" she laughed. Trickles of urine flowed down her bare creamy coloured skin, over her back and then dropping off her buttocks to leave little droplets of the brunette's piss over the tiled floor.<br><br>"Your turn now Sananara" said the girl who had just finished peeing into the wash bowl.<br><br>"I hope you are ready to receive your special shower?" the blond girl asked once again shaking her beautifully mane of falsely coloured hair. This time splashes of urine were sent spraying into the air as they left her strands of yellow.<br><br>Climbing down, the brunette whose name was still unknown to Tan, offered a hand to her friend allowing her to clamber up onto the wash top. Assuming a similar position to her shaved friend, Sananara posed her pussy in the direction of the wash basin she was about to christen with her piss. Barely moments passed before she started to pee.<br><br>Instantly from her dark haired muff shot a lightly yellowed stream of spraying piss which shot through the air and immediately began to patter inside the wash basin. Even from Tan's spy location he could tell that Sananara was pissing a good deal stronger than the first girl. Splashes of golden pee were bouncing out of the bowl as the fake blond continued her toilet. Her yellow urine stream was now a gushing torrent of pee staining the sink with her relief.<br><br>Just then, the brunette moved back into Tan's restrictive vision and he marvelled at the tattoo of a coiled snake imprinted upon her left bum cheek. The groove between her buttocks was delicious; a black line in the centre of perfection, the thin outline of her pussy slit just visible as she bent over to offer the back of her head to Sananara's arching shower of gushing piss. Instantly the blond girl's urine shower started to wash over the brown hair of her friend soaking it instantly. Her hair became a damp pee sodden mess with running streams of spent piss dripping off the strand ends. This strange hair washing involving one girl pissing into the hair of the other, only lasted several more moments before the pee flaps of the blond girl sealed shut in her muff.<br><br>Both girls were laughing hysterically as Sananara descended from her make shift throne where she been peeing into the sink basin. As soon as her feet touched the ground the two girls embraced in a hot passionate kiss, their tongues hungrily seeking out the others. Hand traced their way over each other lithe bodies, fondling and caressing as they went.<br><br>Still kissing Sananara started to finger her friend who gasped in delight and started to kiss her way down the blond girl's neck until she reached her right nipple which instantly became a source of repeated licking and a pretend nibbling. By now Tan was busy stroking his erect penis up and down at the sight of this lesbian love feast being carried out in front of his very eyes. He longed to just run out and place his rock solid dick up inside the brunette's perfectly formed pussy, enjoying the moist ride she would give him as he pumped her hard. In his imagination he imaged her licking the hairy muff of the fake blond whilst all the time he rode her, enjoying the sensation of seeing her buttocks rising and falling with the motion of his thrusting penis.<br><br>However, none of this came to pass as barely moments later a multitude of female screams filled the air from a source not far away from inside the building. No longer caring about being discovered or being seen naked with a fully erect penis, Tan burst out of the bathroom and ran past the startled form the two lesbian girls. They had barely the time to register his presence as he flashed past them and through the exit door. Plunging through he found himself in a narrow corridor which was lit by a multitude of windows running down its length with sunlight pouring in.<br><br>More screams filled the air, even closer this time and Tan knew he was running out of time. At the end of the corridor he was presented with a similar corridor running off in a new direction or alternatively a flight of stairs rising to the level above. Knowing that the Fel had entered the building at ground level he decided that upwards was the best way to go and immediately started his ascent.<br><br>The stairs wound upwards in a spiral past a multitude of frescoes. As he ran, panting for breath he finally worked out where he was. There could no mistaking the King's harem from the displays on the walls. Sexual acts in all manner of forms filled the walls and Tan desperately wished he had more time to study them.<br><br>Reaching the top of the stairs he found a narrow doorway which led him out into fresh air and a walled walkway leading along the edge of a well maintained garden. At the far end, a second door promised another opportunity for escape so he started to sprint towards it. Out of the corner of his eye he could make out movement in the garden below.<br><br>Sounds of screaming and dying women filled the air and he stopped in his tracks to stare downwards at the carnage being varied out below. A handful of Amazon Fel women had breached the inner sanctum and were now delivering fast judgement to the women of the harem caught inside. As Tan watched, a half naked Fel warrior leapt over a garden bench to plunge her blade deep into the belly of a young girl. Red blood splashed over the courtyard tiles staining them with the girls dying fluids.<br><br>Numbed at the sight of the gore Tan remained frozen. He barely heard the opening of the door he had been running towards or the fast footfalls of the running Amazon intent on his position. At the very last instant some deeply buried instinct of survival brought Tan to his senses. Just in time, he ducked as a sharp steel blade swung over his head. Acting on impulse alone caused him to swing upwards and push furiously at the metal torso of the warrior woman's armoured top. He caught a flash of blond pubic hair nestled between two incredibly shaped legs before he was diving for the outer wall of the building.<br><br>Gaining the ledge he was once again saved by his instincts as he leapt upwards avoiding the blade aimed at his ankles. His landing did not go so well and as he came down Tan started to topple. With horror he stared downwards at the dark stone lined pavement waiting for him far below. His mind in overdrive, his actions bolstered by raw adrenaline, Tan saw the roof of the adjacent building opposite. With the last of his grip on the stone wall ledge he pushed with all his might and flew through the air across the gap between the two structures.<br><br>Tan crashed through the thinly thatched surface and dropped heavily into a sprawling pile on the wooden floor below. He had barely time to roll and bring himself to his feet before another figure crashed through the roof after him. For a split moment Tan was numbed by the arrival of the Fel warrior chasing him, but then he acted. With a loud roar of defiance born from the witness of the slaughter in the nearby garden, Tan launched his body at the blond haired warrior who was just gaining her feet. Lacking the opportunity to see Tan coming, the Fel woman was taken completely by surprise as he ploughed into her knocking her backwards and over the short balcony wall.<br><br>They fell together, limbs entwined as Tan fought to grab her sword arm. Their joint arrival on the stone floor many feet below caused them to come apart, both badly winded by the fall. Shakily gaining his feet Tan arose to face his opponent. He was still naked, and still unarmed. He was shocked when he saw his foe in detail for the very first time and was stunned by how young she was. Blond hair, the colour of the blazing sun fell in a short crop around her beautiful facial features. Deep blue eyes, a slight nose and a mouth with pouting lips currently curled into a bestial snarl greeted him as their eyes locked.<br><br>She attacked immediately, her sword swinging wildly in a lunging arch. Dodging the blade, Tan ducked under her guard and smashed his right hand heavily into her exposed elbow causing her to release her sword in pain. The weapon vanished from sight under a table with a loud clatter. Tan had no time to pursue it as his opponent immediately attacked him with a stunning fury. Young fists beat at his chest and he quickly had to block an punch at his face as she shifted her focus.<br><br>Tan could almost not begin to believe his situation. The girl was barely eighteen years of age and yet here she was with murder in her heart and trying to kill him. Something snapped inside him just then and he dealt the warrior Fel girl a hard backhanded swipe knocking her staggering with considerable force. Her flight across the room was halted by a low table which she stumbled against before falling backwards over its top. The last sight Tan caught of his young assailant was that of a perfectly shaved mass of blond pubic hairs nestled between the girl's legs as she vanished from sight.<br><br>Leaping after his assailant Tan vaulted the table only to find her waiting for him. He was only just able to change his flight through the air in time to avoid a stunning blow aimed at his private regions. In sheer self defence Tan kicked hard catching the girl under her chin sending her reeling backwards once more. This time she was halted by the buildings hard outer wall which brought her up straight before collapsing in a heap upon the floor.<br><br>His breaths coming in ragged motions, Tan approached the motionless form. He had a perfect view of her pussy as he neared, and he able to tell that this girl was a natural blond with a lovely deep slit nestled between her legs topped by the small protuberance of her fleshy clit. Her young breasts were hidden by the steel plate covering her chest but the pointed nipple design upon the armour did noting to stop Tan's arousal.<br><br>He stopped short of the Fel girl's body suddenly unsure as to what to do next. He had no intention of raping her, no matter how tempting her pussy might be. He also had no desire to take her life either and that only really left one choice.<br><br>Coming to stand with his feet either side of the unconscious girl Tan took his long penis in his right hand and aimed it at the girl's face. It took a few seconds before he was able to start pissing but then he was doing it. Now he was in full flow, urinating strongly over her face and hair. Changing his aim he quickly peed over her armour enjoying the way in which his piss ran over her steel outlined tits. A sudden gasp caught his attention and immediately he went back to training his flowing piss over the girl's beautiful face.<br><br>Another gasp followed by a series of racking coughs and then she was awake and aware of what was being done to her. A spine chilling scream breeched the air as she found her voice; a sound of hatred and malice. Tan's piss shower instantly vanished into thin air, his heart stopped by the sudden outburst. She made no move to break for freedom. Instead she just stared at him, raw hated on her pretty face as their eyes locked; her beautiful blue orbs as cold as frozen ice. She screamed again.......<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 9</i></p>`,
      10: `<p>RECAP:<br>The land of 'Tash Falaran' is under siege! The village huntress; Sharn has been taken captive by the mysterious army of Amazon Fel women sweeping down from the mountainous northern wastes. These women fight in steel armour that only descends to their waistline where below, their nudity is on proud display. This is partly due to the effect it has on their male adversaries but mainly it forms a crucial part of Fel discipline. The Fel strongly believe in the act of subjugating their foes by pissing all over them! The very act of urinating in another's mouth is the ultimate means of claiming another's soul as bondage. Unfortunately for the Fel, this act is often somewhat lost on their captives.<br><br>In the city of Delait, a rouge thief has, in an incredible encounter, taken captive his very own Fel warrior. Elsewhere, in the capital city of 'Elish Eract' the wise council of leaders has decided that it desperately needs to know about the foe marching upon them from the north. To this end, they have dispatched several groups of their finest warriors in an attempt to learn more about the Fel and their plans.</p><hr class="decor" /><h2>CHAPTER 9: A Warning from the gods</h2><p>The black rain was back again. The heavens were invisible, hidden as they were by the rolling dark clouds which had swept downwards from the mountains in the north. The rain was getting everywhere! Talon could not recall a time when he had felt more miserable than now. The clothing that lay under his heavy armour was already completely sodden his skin damp and cold with its touch. Droplets of water dripped constantly from the rim of his steel helmet and this was rapidly becoming a constant distraction. 'How was a soldier to function under such conditions?' he wondered.<br><br>The view of the mud track ahead vanished into the driving, sheeting rain. Talon was only dimly aware of the rest of his team flanked out on each side. On his right, lost in the dark gloom of this accursed day, was Fathom; a brute of a man and an unstoppable berserker in the heat of a fight. Talon new his mood would be foul and had no desire to reel him. To his left, he was just conscious of the fleeting shadow hiding in the murk of the rain. This was 'Slider', the teams' resident assassin. The woman was gorgeous; there was little doubt about the matter. Midnight black hair flowed down over her perfect shoulders, her eyes like black orbs in her pretty angular face. Her full lips rarely smiled but when they did it was a terrible sight. The enjoyment the woman took from a kill was almost obscene. Talon had witnessed the woman in action and the look of almost sexual excitement upon her face as she had slid her blade across a man's neck had been a horror to behold. Shuddering once again but this time for a different reason Talon took a fleeting glance behind him. Nothing but the lancing rain met his gaze. Returning his focus to the path ahead, Talon marched on. He had little doubt that the forth and final member of his team was out there somewhere.<br><br>He had known 'Null' for many moons now and yet had to formulate a sound opinion about the man. Quite, dark and deadly; these were all useful terms to describe the killer who was now their backup, somewhere lost in the gloom. Talon shook his head sending droplets of water flying in all directions as he did so. 'What had he done to deserve this assortment of misfits in his team?' he wondered, his mood already fouled by the weather. Suddenly something in the driving rain ahead caught his attention. Large and towering the artefact slid into view as he advanced. A form appeared to his side and his sword was already moving from its scabbard. The blade was half way clear when he realised that the body belonged to his female assassin.<br><br>"What is it?" she shouted above the hammering sound of the rain upon the ground around them.<br><br>"How should I know?" he shouted back in annoyance. Two more figures arrived appearing like wraiths out of the sheeting rain. Fathom and Null; their shapes were unmistakable even in these conditions.<br><br>Holding up one had to hold his team back, Talon advance on the black shape that now towered over them. Removing his right glove Talon reached up to touch what looked like black rock.<br><br>"I wouldn't do that if I were you," suddenly said a strong male voice.<br><br>Talon snatched his hand back as if he had been bitten and whirled around. Nothing but the three forms of his team looked at him expectantly.<br><br>"Who said that?" Talon snarled.<br><br>"Said what?" Fathom's booming voice enquired, reached out across the distance between them.<br><br>"Said that." repeated Talon stupidly.<br><br>"Said what?" Fathom asked again, annoyance quite clear in his voice.<br><br>This time Talon didn't reply. Instead he unsheathed his sword and took a step away from the black artefact which he could now see was clearly half buried in the ground.<br><br>"There is somebody else here." Talon said, his eyes searching through the gloom. The effect on his team was immediate. Without another word weapons appeared in the hands of his three companions. Back to back they took a defensive formation enveloping Talon into their fold and becoming a four pointed star formation. Slowly the warriors from 'Elish Eract' circled around presenting each member the opportunity to study the same point of void as the others. The heavy curtain of rain continued to fall around them blanketing off the view of the world beyond.<br><br>"Oh come now Talon," said the voice once again. It was clear and refined and spoke of good breeding. However, the point of its origin was mysterious in its location, seeming to float out of the misting void from all sides.<br><br>"You know my name?" challenged Talon. "Why don't you show yourself then?"<br><br>"I know all your names of course, and more." The voice came again, clearly cutting through the patter of the rain on the rocky ground around them. "I know you, Fathom, Slider and." The voice paused for a second. "Null? Is that we are going by now, is it? Fair enough!"<br><br>"ENOUGH!" yelled Talon his short patience already exhausted. "Who are you?"<br><br>A shimmering in the air before him announced the arrival of the individual. At the same moment the rain around them vanished as if an invisible canopy had been erected overhead.<br><br>"NO! I don't believe it!" Talon's voice dropped to a whisper as he recognised the young male form in front of him. Talon dropped to both knees as if the wind had been driven from his lungs. It was not everyday he got to meet a god.<br><br>The remaining three fighters hung back nervously playing with their weapons unsure of what to do next. The man who had arrived was dressed in fine robes, a mixture of fine reds and dark greens, twisting patterns that ran over the radiant fabric. His hair was a golden blond, short and perfectly cut. Bright blue eyes that radiated intelligence studied them momentarily before dismissing them like a farmer with familiar cattle.<br><br>"Talon, our time is short, so listen well. The pantheon of gods who watch over your fate is in disarray. The enemy you now face is not of this world. This, thing," the god paused casting a glance in the direction of the hulking mass in the rain. "It is an abomination and comes from outside our realm. You have erred greatly in approaching it and I fear there is little I can do now to save you."<br><br>"Save us from what?" snarled Fathom from behind the kneeled form of his leader. The brute had never been one for church.<br><br>"From those that already encircle you," The young god cast his hands around him.<br><br>This had the desired effect. With a hunted look Fathom swept his head back and forth scanning the driving rain that now thundered down outside their protective shield.<br><br>"As I was saying," the young god Anatatus continued, "I have little time. Know this mortal souls, what is about to befall you is something you must bare." The god stopped, looked at Slider and gave a knowing smile. "Some of you may even enjoy the experience. Now, all of you close your eyes and except my blessing for this is what may ultimately save your souls from damnation at the hands of the Fel."<br><br>"I'm not closing my eyes for no one," stated Fathom his large arms bunching as his muscles tensed.<br><br>"I SAID CLOSE YOUR EYES" The god screamed his voice whipping like a crescendo of sound around them. Fathom, Slider and Null were thrown to the ground their hands raised as if to protect themselves. A blinding flash of light crashed down from the heavens encompassing all. The ground boiled around the shapes of the three men and the one woman, the god now departed.<br><br>The constant patter of the rain was the only companion to them now. Dazed they picked themselves up from the sodden earth. It was then that they became aware of the shapes appearing out of the thick mist. Tall, regal and all incredible beautiful, the Fel were truly a sight to behold. Each woman, and they were many, was dressed in splendidly polished armour. The rounded shapes of guarded breasts were tipped with steel encased nipples. The driving rain ran enticingly over their armour making it look a second skin, giving it false life. The party of encircled warriors could do little now but stare lower and take in the sight of the assortment of uncovered crotches on display. Each Fel woman was naked from the waist downwards. Flawless skin in an assortment of colours, ranged from a light pale complexion to heavy brown ebony. Between each woman's thighs her pussy hair lined her lower lips forming a perfect triangle nestled around her crotch. Talon could feel his erection building as he stared in amazement and wonder at the sight around him. He had never seen such beauty let alone such a public display of nudity before. He would happily bed each one of them if it were not for their dark looks of contempt being levelled at him and his companions.<br><br>Their meeting with the god Anatatus was forgotten now. Tightening his sword in his grasp Talon readied himself for a fight. It was not easy with such an array of beautiful pussies on display and Talon realised that this was probably the reason the Fel dressed this way. Just then, two Amazons rushed him, one from each side. His reflexes saved him, his sword swinging up in time to parry the first blade. Diving to one side he desperately fought to dodge the second sword swinging his way. Talon had always been fast but these Fel women were impossible faster. As he landed and rolled he came up only to find two blades coming at him again. Desperately he blocked one steel blade only to have the second launch towards his unprotected neck were armour and helm met. In an attempt to dodge he lost his footing on the damp floor underneath and he fell crashing down to earth. As he collapsed to the ground he was aware of the fighting going on around him. Two Fel women apiece had attacked his companions, each partnership resulting in equal success.<br><br>The Fel women were upon him immediately and with little mercy. His sword was knocked from his flailing fist as a strong foot found his groin. Reeling in agony he was in little position to resist the rough hands that seized him and began to tie ropes around his frame. Gagging he fought for air. Around him he could make out a similar fate had befallen his team, each one now pinned to the floor with the luscious forms of many Fel around them. Even through the red pain reeling up from his groin, Talon couldn't help but stare at the assortment of bare female buttocks now on display. These women were simply perfect!<br><br>It didn't take long for the Fel to sort out their captives. Talon was separated from his bedraggled companions who were now bound to a tall tree. The rain had ceased almost at the same instance his team had fallen to the Amazons. It was almost as if the two had been connected. Swearing at his captors had only earned him a strong clip around the back of his head. In silent protest he had decided he would letch at their nudity on display instead. A shapely figure had stepped out from the crowd of Amazons and was now approaching him. His own bonds had been tied tight, his feet locked behind him as he knelt upon his knees. As the woman approached Talon simply could help but stare at the perfect shape of the triangular mass of curly brown pubic hairs that lined the woman's lower lips. It was these very lips that were brought to within inches of his face allowing him to see every detail of her womanhood. He could feel the feel the heat of her flesh radiating across the short distance between them. The sight of her little clit almost hidden at the top of her pussy lips was enough to drive Talon's hormones into raging overdrive. For a second he thought that she was offering herself to him, allowing him to sample the tastes of her love hole. He was just on the verge of sampling her delights with a probing tongue when intuition suddenly screamed a warning. Desperately he tried to twist away but it was too late. With an initial strong and hot squirt, the Fel warrior woman started to piss over him.<br><br>Talon's muscles bunched underneath his armour as the Amazon woman subjected him to her golden spray. Hot squirting piss landed on his face as the woman deliberately traced her urine stream in the direction of his mouth. His lips were tight shut. He would be damned if he would taste this woman's effluent upon his tongue. Suddenly a sharp whack to the back of his head left him reeling, the impact sending forward, sagging in his bonds. He gasped for air and was immediately rewarded by a hot salty stream of piss landing in his mouth as the Amazon in front of him saw her opportunity. Gagging, he spat trying to rid his tongue of the taste of the woman's pee. However the woman's squirting piss shower showed no sign of diminishing and continued to rain down upon his face.<br><br>The rest of his team watched on, powerless to assist as their leader was subjected to the Amazon woman's pussy shower. Tied as they were to the tree behind the woman, their view was some what restricted. However there was no mistaking the sight of the golden pee stream squirting out of the woman's pussy, and raining outwards towards the helpless Talon. The sight of the woman's relief was framed by her perfectly formed bum cheeks, naked as they were beneath her upper armour. Fathom was rock hard inside his soiled black pants. The woman's nudity and her disgusting act of pissing over his commanding officer was possibly the most arousing thing he had ever scene. Beside him, Slider obviously felt otherwise as she thrashed in her bonds. As an assassin she had on many occasions had the need to relive herself in unorthodox and interesting locations. When waiting for the prey to arrive it was often the case that one had to improvise in a good manner of things. At the very back of her mind was playing one particular memory. The scene of the pissing Amazon warrior in front of her was causing the imagery of the time to come flooding back.<br><br>Slider's mission had been the culling of the head of a particular Noble family who had been making too much of a nuisance of themselves in the affairs of the capital city of 'Elsh Eract'. She had waited until nightfall before breaching the defences of the Noble's household. It not taken long and she had found herself in the upper master bedroom. Behind her the latch on the window betrayed her point of entry, lit as it was now, by the bright moonlight shining in from outside. The waiting had been long and Slider had soon started to feel the need to pee burning in her bladder. She had not dared leave the room for fear of her mission failing. The Noble was sure to return to his bed at some stage during the night and she would be ready for his return.<br><br>Her sense of duty had done nothing to distil the growing discomfort in her bladder. Knowing full well that she could not perform at full efficiency with such a distraction she set about answering the call of nature. Her tight leather pants were soon on the floor and hidden under the bed. Between her long muscular legs, the dark shape of her black hared pussy could just be made out in the shadows playing on her skin as she squatted down in one corner. A sharp hiss and patter immediately started to fill the large room as from her pussy lips shot a strong flowing shower of hot golden pee. Her pussy spray landed on the wooden floor boards immediately spreading outwards in a growing puddle.<br><br>Her heart leapt at the sound her impromptu toilet was making. Surely the noise of her piss spraying over the floor would alert the guards. Desperately she tried to stop. After a second or so her golden torrent of squirting piss diminished in strength and then vanished as Slider forced close her pee hole. Standing up she searched the room for anything that could be used quietly for a pee. Inspiration struck her as she spied the golden goblet on the table by the bed. Grabbing it she quickly held it up to her waiting muff lips before immediately resuming her piss.<br><br>That was much better, she told herself as she stood there peeing into the goblet whilst moonlight covered her semi naked body. Her wide and perfectly formed bum cheeks were covered in moonlit silver as she stood by the window having her pee. Between her legs her hot pussy spray was squirting strongly into the goblet currently held up to her hairy pussy. The sense of urgency was diminishing now as her bladder slowly empted whilst her pussy allowed her hot relief to jet from her pee hole. Slider was now aware of a new sensation replacing that of the desperate need to pee. This feeling was something more interesting, naughty even! It was then she realised she was getting a buzz from having her piss in the Noble's bedroom. As he was soon going to die there seemed little point in holding back on her fun so it was then that Slider decided she would experiment a little further.<br><br>Between her legs and in her delicious pussy, Slider's pee hole closed shut sealing off her current pee. By no means done, she decided that the bed would be the next location for her new toilet. Leaping like an agile cat she landed on the firm bed. Moving to the very centre of the luxurious and extremely expensive bed sheets, Slider gazed downwards at her uncovered pussy just a fraction distant from the covers. Slider's pee arrived in a moment. One second and her piss flaps were shut tight, the next and she was busily squirting her hot piss all over the place. This was fantastic fun! Slider had smiled then, the special smile that few living got to remember. The sensation of naughty pissing had been intense coupled with the incredible feeling of release as her bladder emptied. Leaning back on her hands Slider stared between her parted legs at the fast flowing stream of urine squirting out of her cunt hole. Concentrating she focused on squeezing harder and harder with her pussy muscles watching as the fountain of pee leaving her crotch increased in size. The bed sheets by now had received a good soaking from Slider's urine shower and the damp stain growing on them was becoming more noticeable by the second.<br><br>Fearing that the sight of the damp piss stained sheets may compromise her mission Slider had decide she best finish her pee elsewhere. There wasn't much left inside her now and she really wanted to enjoy the last few seconds of her relief. Tip toeing across to the thick curtains that lay bunched to either side of the large window, Slider moved into position. Grabbing a piece of the heavy fabric she moved it up to her waiting pussy. Seconds later and a wet stream of female piss sprayed over the curtain as Slider finished off her toilet. Letting the urine stained material drop back into place against the wall by the window, the beautiful assassin quickly dressed again. Once her leggings were once more snugly around her shapely bum cheeks and her hairy pussy hidden from view, Slider resumed her wait in the long shadows by the one wall. That same night, once her mission had been fulfilled and the slain noble man tucked into his piss stained bed sheets, Slider had fled to her abode. The masturbatory sessions that followed had continued until day break, her soft moans of orgasmic pleasure dying with the cock calls that heralded the sunrise.<br><br>A fumbling at the ropes that bound her to the tree brought Slider back from her memories and crashing back into the present. The Amazons had finished with Talon who now lay gagging on the damp grass. A tall beauty with long flowing blond hair and a perfect triangular formation of pubic pussy hairs now guarded the distraught man. Slider eyes narrowed as she studied the woman. The outline of large full breasts were moulded into her heavy upper armour, the metal buds of her nipples looking supple and erect even in hard steel. Slider wanted to kill her, but there again she wanted to slay all of these tall, luscious Amazon bitches that had taken her company prisoner. How she would love to dance in their spilt blood as their open necks gaped outwards at a world they had departed!<br><br>The assassin could feel her hormones racing at the very idea of exacting her bloody revenge but this was cut short as her bounds were released. With a hard push she was sent reeling to the ground, the sodden grass catching her fall. Nimbly she leapt to her feet, murder foremost in her mind. Unfortunately the Fel were faster. Two tall and incredibly well proportioned warrior women were upon her immediately, their graceful movements seemingly unimpaired by their heavy upper armour. Slider let out a curse as her hands were locked to one side and she started to thrash with her legs instead. Obliviously to her struggles the two warriors flanking her lifted Slider's body clear off the ground and set off into the still heavy mist.<br><br>Greyness filled Slider's sight as she was carried off into the seemingly empty void. The Fel seemed to have little trouble navigating their way for within the span of seventy heartbeats a non natural structure appeared out of the gloom. As they neared Slider saw that it was a large tent wide with a wide curtained entrance. The material was drab in colour but as the entranceway slid by, Slider was impressed by the obviously good cut of the fabric. The inside of the tent was stiflingly warm with large metal braziers sent off at various locations around the single room. The glow from the fires within cast the interior in a ruddy red glow but before Slider could absorb all that she was seeing she was roughly turned around and thrown on a bed of stretched hide attached to a sturdy wooden frame. Hands once again bound her this time both at the wrists and ankles. Suddenly a long evil looking blade appeared in Slider's vision and she felt her heart stop at its suggestion. The blade flashed downwards and Slider fearing the end clutched her eyes tight shut, anger at the impulse flooding her brain at the same moment.<br><br>Instead of the feel of cold steel entering her flesh, Slider felt the blade cutting at her clothing. The weapon passed with little resistance through her leather top and she felt her breasts falling outwards as they were released from their bond. The feeling of rapidly revealing nudity continued as the blade traced downwards. It was a miracle or true testament to the owner's blade skill that she was not being marked as her undress continued. Her pants offered as little resistance as had her top and within moments all remnants of her clothes were being pulled away from her now completely nude body. Any second now and Slider expected to see a hairy pussy shoved in her face and a stream of piss squirted in the direction of her mouth. Her bonds were so tight she could barely move and lifting her head as high as possible off the bed revealed little to her captors' new intentions.<br><br>Suddenly Slider was aware of the presence of several bodies around her bed. Looking to her left she almost gasped in surprise at the sight that greeted her. Three Fel women were approaching her bed, each one of them completely nude. The Amazon warriors looked even more regal and incredibly stunning now devoid of their usual armour. Each woman's breasts were full and beautifully proportioned to the body they accompanied. Rose bud nipples stood erect and proud surrounded by the red welts that encircled them. The slight rise and fall of their movement as the woman walked slowly closer was mesmerising. In Slider's peripheral vision she was fully conscious of the triangular masses of pubic hair that lined each woman's crotch, hiding their pussy lips from sight. Movement to her other side caused Slider to whip her head around only to find three more naked Fel women approaching her position. Two of these women were dark skinned something Slider had never seen before. Their beauty seemed to have been carved from the ebony wood of some exotic tree; their movement's sublime in grace as they settled down softly by the side of her bed.<br><br>Slider stared entranced into the deep wells of the nearest woman's eyes as she leaned over the bed. For a second Slider registered the warmth radiating from the woman's flesh before her moist lips pressed against her own. The kiss was so unexpected that Slider started to accept it before she even registered the action. The woman's lips were an aphrodisiac; a promise of pleasures so deep and profound that the assassin was powerless to do nothing but accept the deepening and passionate press of lips upon her own. A teasing tongue slipped into her mouth seeking out a companion. Slider's mind reeled as her hormones overloading her ability to reason. Helplessly she returned the kiss, her own desperate need growing by the millisecond.<br><br>Warm hands from many locations touched her skin, carefully at first but more inquisitive by the second. In a distant part of her reeling sanity Slider registered the presence of the Fel women exploring her flesh. Her deep kiss with the ebony skinned warrior was still on-going, tongues flicking against one another with increasing passion. Slider tried to resist the manipulations being done to her body but her bonds still held her tight. Somebody was now caressing her naked breasts, the warrior woman's hands surprisingly supple and incredibly adept as they fondled with a lover's attention. Suddenly Slider felt a warm mouth settle around her left nipple. Her body involuntary tried to arch upwards in response to the stimulus. Strong hands that were still massaging and caressing her flesh pushed her downwards and Slider felt a second mouth encircle her right nipple. Probing tongues teased and caressed her buds driving the beautiful assassin's desires into sexual overload. Release was nowhere in sight and just then Slider registered an even more erotic thrill. One Fel warrior was between her legs, a moist tongue seeking out the wetness between her thighs.<br><br>Slider gasped and moaned, eyes tight shut as she momentarily broke contact with the woman kissing her. The sensation coming from her pussy as a playful tongue experimented with her protruding clit was simply too much to bear. Never had Slider experienced so much pleasure. She was oblivious to why she not already had been driven to orgasmic overload, her sexual release seeming nowhere near imminent. The soft fondling going on around her body was continuing as was the attention being delivered to her tits and pussy hole. Slider's mind reeled once again and she slipped helplessly into a new and more passionate kissing embrace with her ebony lover.<br><br>The Fel attention to her body continued without end. Passion, need and incredible sexual desire filled every fabric of Slider's body, mind and soul. One warrior woman had even slipped a hand beneath her buttocks and was probing a long digit into Slider's bum hole. It was all too much! Slider broke contact with her latest kiss and thrashed her head from side to side.<br><br>"Stop it!" she screamed. "I can't take it any more."<br><br>Collapsing back into the fold of the bed's mattress she strained with all her might at the bonds holding her. It was to no avail. Her bonds held as did her captor's interest in her sweat lined naked body. The brown skinned woman who had been kissing her so passionately gave her a seductive smile and rose from her position by the bed. With a quick motion she raised one leg and stretched it over Slider helpless body. The woman moved into position straddling the assassin's upper body and Slider caught sight of the woman's pussy. Midnight black pubic hairs curled around the woman's lower lips and Slider could easily see the slight protuberance of the woman's clit as the deep groove between the woman's pussy lips was moved into position above her mouth.<br><br>Slider held her breath firmly, locking her mouth shut. Any second she expected to feel a hot jetting stream of piss flowing over her face. She screwed her eyes tight in effort to stop the warriors' salty pee from going into them. The seconds passed but no hot gushing piss stream graced her face. The rest of her body continued to register the pleasure that the Fel were administrating in their various ways. Ecstasy continued to fill her pleasure registers, neural impulses of utter sexual joy flooding along her brains' receptacles. The dark skinned woman now sat upon her chest with her pussy up to Slider's mouth had slipped her hands around the side of assassin's head was now doing something extremely pleasurable to her ear lobes. Slider had no idea why they were doing this to her. She could smell the Fel warrior's pussy just in front of her mouth and it now simply too much to hold back now. Slider opened her eyes and gazed at the deliciously tempting sight of the pussy hole hovering just a scant distance from her lips. Gingerly Slider poked out her tongue allowing it to skip for just a second along the fleshy outline of the Amazon's pussy lips. She felt a shudder run through the warrior and then it was simply too much to hold back any longer.<br><br>Slider had never wanted something so much in her life. Burying her face in the woman's hairy muff she started to lick and play with the woman's clit as if her life depended upon it. Orgasmic stimulus ran through the course of every sensual receiver in her body but yet Slider did not climax. Her head was reeling, both from the effects of the ministrations of stimulus being performed her body and from the reeking incense that filled the tent air. Her small but perfect breasts were still being kissed and sucked by two tender and attentive mouths. Between her legs, another woman continued to lick lovingly at her now extremely wet pussy. Warm hands played around her body, massaging, caressing and stimulating her in ways Slider had never known could exist.<br><br>For her own part she was still licking away at the brown skinned woman's pussy when part of her brain registered the fact that the woman licking her own womanhood had withdrawn. Suddenly a new sense of stimulus made itself known, which almost overloaded Slider's awareness. A cold but yet deliciously smoothly object was being slowly inserted into her pussy. The shape must have resembled a long cylinder with a rounded head, its dimensions perfect for the fit of Slider's love hole. Slowly but with reassuring pressure the object slipped deeper into her body. Slider knew she was trembling now both from near exhaustion and from the incredible feeling issuing from between her legs. Just then a similar object was placed up to her bum hole which readily accepted the protuberance allowing it entrance. Now she was being fucked in both holes, the owners of the two objects handling their charge with professional care. Finally Slider could feel her body moving to orgasm. Faster and faster, the objects started to slide up and downwards inside her. The sensation was too much. Letting go from her hold on the dark skinned warrior's clit she hung her head backwards and screamed like never before.<br><br>Slider's scream was that of a new born; bitterly protesting the emergence into a bright new world. Her call echoed impossibly around her, reverberating in her ears. Her orgasm took her fully and her body racked in convulsions as pleasure beyond endurance radiated through her soul. Her world went white, her vision blinded and overloaded by the shuddering aftermath of her world ending orgasm. Joy and bliss took on new dimensions as Slider came and then came again, her multiple climaxes coming on one after another. Somewhere in the very depth of her brain, her consciousness had hidden from the invasion of pleasure being pumped through her body. It was here that Slider was becoming aware of a new sensation. Her skin was registering a multitude of extremely warm and deliciously wet streams of liquid raining over her flesh. Finally she realised that the assorted Fel around the bed were now pissing all over her and the wetness she could feel on her skin was that of their piss showers washing over her flesh. Slider had never imagined that having another woman pee over her could be so nice. Now in the aftermath of her orgasms it was like a cleansing ritual dragging her slowly back to a world that adored her. She knew instinctually what she must do now. Her new found lovers desired to give her the gift of their hot piss, to squirt it into her mouth so she could taste their very essence and belong to them entirely.<br><br>Obliging Slider opened her mouth wide. Instantly a deliciously hot stream of female piss shot inside washing over her tongue and taste buds. Slider took a deep gulp drinking the Fel's woman's piss and enjoying every second as it slid down her throat. Another mouthful and then another in a seemingly endless supply of golden pee. Slider swooned in ecstasy. She belonged to them now; heart and soul. The hot salty pee overflowing in her mouth ran over her lower lip and trickled down her throat. Meanwhile her naked, sweaty body was still being treated to a multitude of urine showers as the assorted naked Fel women peed all over her. The hot impact points where their pissed sprayed over her body was each a delectable sensation of sexual joy. This was a baptism of piss, one where Slider would be made whole with her new found lovers; her new sisters; her real family.<br><br>Finally the Fel finished using Slider's body as a receptacle for their pee. One by one as they finished pissing they took a step backwards. With eyes full of admiration and love Slider stared passionately upwards at the brown skinned woman who had just been urinating in her mouth.<br><br>"We will call you Felateen" said a silky voice in her mind. The Fel's woman's lips had not moved but Slider knew it was her who now spoke inside her head.<br><br>"You are now one of us," the soft seductive voice continued. "We need you to carry out a task for us. This task will require you to walk amongst those that once you called fellow men and women. You must always remember though that you are part of us now. Your mission is to travel to a city far away in the north. We need you to find a man for us. This man, this thief, has taken something from us and most be punished accordingly. Felateen you are to slay the one known to his kin as Tan Slander."<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 10</i></p>`,
      11: `<h2>Chapter 10</h2><p>Sharn stared at her naked blond opponent. The girl was a cold beauty her flawless body perfectly formed. Every curve of her shapely figure seemed to have been created by a master craftsman dedicated to his art. A small matting of blond curly hairs formed a triangle of protective hair around the groove of made by the girl's pussy lips. It was only just possible to see the protuberance of her clit sticking out at the top her love channel. Her breasts were small but beautifully proportioned to the rest of her lithe body. Red welts surrounded the girl's hardened nipples and as Sharn stared at the girl's tits she suddenly realised just how horny this situation was making her opponent.<br><br>The fact that her opponent was getting a sexual thrill from the pending fight suddenly gave Sharn an incredible idea. For her own part, facing almost certain death at the hands of this cold blue eyed killer, Sharn was on the verge of letting her terror getting the better of her. The shouts and calls from the surveying crowd of Fel women watching from all sides, rose in her ears as a rising crescendo of sound which threatened to numb her with its intensity. The need to pee was desperate in her bladder as fear of her death rose with a promise of certainty as Sharn's wandering gaze fell to the shining steel blade in her opponent's steady hand. In her brain, her thoughts were running wild with crazy and impossible ideas of flight from her predicament. However as the seconds raced by with the pending certitude of the coming fight, one thought, one possible glimpse at salvation, lingered foremost at the centre of her brain.<br><br>When Sharn had previously fought this nubile young goddess of war in their training games, she had always lost. However Sharn had always been aware of the one fact that she was marginally faster than the other girl. This miniscule advantage had never been enough to even hint at the chance of victory, but now, faced with almost certain death, this memory was giving Sharn a hint at possible salvation.<br><br>Suddenly the crowd's roars soared to a new level as the presiding marshal moving into the centre of the sand covered area. Sharn stared at the warrior woman with a new found hate. The tall Fel warrior was adorned with a shining breastplate of steel tempered to exaggerate the shape of her full and shapely breasts. Hard steel nipples completed this effect creating an illusion of alluring temptation. This coupled with the triangular mass of dark brown pubic hairs nestled between the woman's legs should have made her an object of utter desirability as was the allure of any Fel woman. However at this moment in time Sharn could think of nothing more hateful. This strutting woman with her polished sword held high in the air in preparation of declaring the start of the pending slaughter, represented to Sharn the pinnacle of everything she had come to despise in her captors. What with their utter arrogance and their perfect bodies plus their constant need to piss all over their subjugated slaves<br><br>The marshal's sword began in downwards swing. Sharn watched the beginning of its descent as if in slow motion. The cry of the crowd, eager for the sight of spilt blood had all but vanished from her ears. Sharn's waking world had become the beat of her heart, the cold touch of the sand beneath her feet, the sensation of every waking cell pulsing with a focused need of energy waiting to be released. The marshal's sword was half way through its motion now. Sharn's hazel eyes were locked onto her opponents steel blue orbs. There it was, the moment of distraction! The blond naked killer opposition Sharn had shifted her focus for the briefest of seconds. Knowing that the time had arrived, Sharn moved into action.<br><br>With a piercing scream she leapt forwards, her own weapon falling discarded from her hand as she moved. Her call was a cry of anguish, of pain, of grief, and of hated. All the emotions that she had been forced to bottle up during her time of captivity by these depraved Fel women was carried in her voice. The constant humiliation and shame she had felt as the warrior women had pissed all over her body, time and time again, was now leaving her throat as she launched herself towards her foe.<br><br>Sharn's lithe body was now in the air hurtling forwards across the short space that parted the two combatants. Her scream continued as the distance closed. The loss and brutal slaughter of her family was in her scream, as was all the fear she carried for the loss of her land to these unstoppable warrior women. She was almost upon her opponent now. The blond killer was now only just reacting to the events upon her. Her right hand was now in motion bringing up the cruel edge of her weapon to bear on Sharn's defenceless body. However her reactions were a fraction too slow, numbed only just enough by Sharn's voice of rage as she flew towards her.<br><br>Time jumped back into line with reality. Sharn impacted into the blond girl's body, driving the air from her lungs and sending her sprawling backwards. A lancing pain drove into Sharn's brain as she scrambled upwards from their impact and she dimly realised she had been cut by a flailing sword as her naked opponent dropped to the sandy ground. Knowing that to hesitate for the briefest of moments would spell her doom, Sharn continued her attack. Cruelly she aimed a punch at the blond girl's nose, delivering a shocking blow that delivered a sharp snapping sound and an explosion of blood from the girl's face. Ignoring the shock of pain racing upwards from her bruised knuckles she rained down another blow, fuelling her strike with all her desperate rage. The blond girl went down, her body smacking the sand with a dull sound that reverberated through Sharn's ears. A silence had stolen the voice from the crowd as they watched with amazement at the unexpected turn of events.<br><br>Sharn's panting breath was ragged as she raised her arm for another strike at the defenceless blond girl below her. In her peripheral vision she could just make out the sight of the Amazon marshal moving to intercept the fight before it could continue. A wave of realisation came over Sharn at that moment as a shattering bolt of knowledge pierced her brain. She had never been expected to win this fight. The Fel had known all along that the other girl had been the favourite, the crowd pleaser. Numbness threatened to overcome Sharn at the revelation of the unfairness that had been focused upon her. The crowd had wanted, no, needed to see her blood spilt upon the sand this day, to witness her end as her life fled from her slain body. Now here she was, with possible victory so close and now about to stolen from her by the Fel marshal woman.<br><br>A steel of resolve rose into Sharn's soul at that moment. This was definitely not the way things would go. She stared down at the mess she had made of the once pretty girl's face. In the back of her head a stealing pain was screaming for attention but Sharn ignored it. Oblivious even to the red stain marking her belly Sharn gazed downwards at the sight of her naked, brown haired muff hovering only inches away from the face of her defeated foe. The need to pee was a simple one to obey, her racked nerves collapsing as she released the muscles which were sealing her pee hole shut. Barely a moment later and Sharn was pissing. Between her sweat soaked and sand covered legs a hot golden stream was now raining downwards in a thick twisting stream. Her golden shower impacted on the blond girl's face, striking her right cheek and running off in all directions. Immediately the fallen blond began to cough and stutter as Sharn's hot piss ran around her nose and mouth.<br><br>"Drink it you BITCH!" Sharn commanded in a hissed whisper. Already she could she the advancing marshal switching to a run as she made to incept the actions going on between the two fighters. Too late! The blond girl, gagging for air made a grievous mistake. Turning her head she open her mouth to gasp for air only to be rewarded by Sharn's hot squirting urine as she aimed it as best she could into the mouth of her opponent.<br><br>Blue eyes stared with dismay up at Sharn's face as slow realisation came as to what was being done to her. The look immediately turned to hate and she immediately stated to gag at the hot piss in her mouth. Sharn didn't stop. By Fel law and with the crowd as witness she now claimed the blond warrior as her own bond slave. The ancient ritual of pissing in another's mouth as claim to bondage was too deeply established for any excuse to lay claim to. No! Even though she had won, even though she had claimed the servitude of her fallen foe, Sharn did not stop her squirting piss shower. Between her lithe and muscled legs, Sharn's golden relief continued to rain downwards, covering the struggling blonde's face with hot piss. Exultation ran though Sharn's body as she savoured just how complete her victory was. The sensation of releasing her piss was as gorgeous as was the thrill of finally being able to piss in another's mouth. The sight of her twisting golden pee as it left her pee hole was incredible to behold just as was the resulting scene of her urine flowing over the blonde girl's face and body.<br><br>Slowly and without stopping her toilet, Sharn rose to her legs. Between her shapely thighs, her golden rain continued to fall downwards. Gherian was covered in Sharn's spent pee by now. Golden traces of urine trickled down past her breasts and her hair was sodden with Sharn's piss. The arena was deathly quite. Staring around Sharn took in the gazes of the watching Fel. Joy and relief poured though her body as the sensation of still being alive washed through her. Between her legs, her opponent endured her punishment with all the training the Fel had instilled in her. Servitude was absolute, certain death to rebel.<br><br>Sharn was suddenly aware of a voice high up in the watching crowd of Fel women. For a second she didn't recognise the words but then she realised that it was her own name that was being called. The last yellow drops of hot, body warmed piss dripped from her pussy lips and fell onto the hapless Gherian.<br><br>Sharn looked upwards to find Felquest's figure stood amongst taller Fel warrior women. It was she who was calling out 'Sharn' in a repetitive shout. Slowly and amazingly the call was taken out by those around Felquest. At first the hesitation in the voices was apparent but then the chorus started to take on vigour. Slowly the call built, echoing around the arena and seeming to soar upwards to challenge the heavens.<br><br>"Sharn!"<br><br>"Sharn!"<br><br>"SHARN!"<br><br>The Fel were stamping their bare feet upon the wooden floor of their enclosures. The sound racketed downwards mixing with the call of her name. Sharn stared in bewilderment at the crowd and their now completely enthusiastic rapture. She had finally done it! Here and now, Sharn of the lost village of Ternhast, former huntress of the slain clan of Delahean, was now a fully fledged Amazon warrior woman of the Fel.<br><br><i>Continued in Chapter 11</i></p>`,
      12: `<h2>Chapter 11</h2><p>The rain washed streets held little remorse from the rancour of the pounding heavens, the boom of thunder echoing heavily away before being swallowed by the foothills of the mighty Kilendarth Mountains. The city of Trenasruine was the Farth Kingdom's second largest after the capital and commanded a critical conjunction of trading routes on the way to neighbouring domains. Beyond the Kilendarths there had issued rumours of a strange fortress that had appeared out of nowhere, crossing the realms between magic and the mundane. Such stories were accompanied by tales of amazon women who exposed their femininity for all to see and were beholden to strange fetishes that they practiced on those they vanquished.<br><br>For the two burly city guards hunkered down inside their armour against the heavy rain, it was often a subject for joking debate, each man most keen to describe the sordid delights they would like to undertake when the Amazons were brought back to the city in chains as prisoners to be sold in the local markets. As depravities went, neither guard was overly imaginative, staying with the theme of which orifice they would like to stick their thrusting cocks.<br><br>They were in the middle of such an exchange, their voices raised against the storm and the lash of the rain, when they encountered a huddled form nestled between a heaped pile of rotting and discarded crates.<br><br>'Oy, you maggot piece of refuse,' shouted the one guard. The walls of the opposing buildings that formed the small alley were weeping streams of rainwater, the gutting above broken in many places. 'There is a curfew on. Beggars the likes of you are meant to be down at quays and not allowed in the streets.'<br><br>There was no response from the figure huddled inside the rags, the facial features hidden in the shadows of the tattered hood that the gutting flames from the guard's tar stained torches could not dispel, even when thrust up close.<br><br>'Ha, a mute or deaf, or both,' laughed the second guard cruelly whilst fumbling at the cord around his leggings. 'Maybe this will wake you up,' and with that took aim with his freed cock and started to piss in the direction of the hooded beggar. The hot stream mixed with the lashing rain but stayed on course, splashing down over the beggar's head. Both guards laughed. It was their last act in the land of the living.<br><br>With a speed that defied tracking, the beggar's disguise was shed, the nimble warrior woman beneath uncoiling like a serpent, her tools of war going to work. A released throwing knife lodged into the windpipe of the man who had been pissing over her, his hands trying to stem the crimson flow. A second edged weapon disembowelled the second guard who out of instinct had rushed to free his sword. She was upon him as he crashed to the floor, his lifeblood seeping from the terrible wound.<br><br>The warrior woman was dressed in black attire, a dark angel against the even darker heavens. She squatted down over the face of the guard she had downed, his life all but spent. He had but moments to realise the fact that the area around her crotch was free from cloth, her exposed pussy shoved into his face. A hot spray began to wash over him even as he gasped his last, her clear stream of urine steaming against the chill of the rain.<br><br>She peed until she was spent, the emptiness in her bladder in need of replenishment. Fortunately, there would be drinking fountains on her way for she was headed into the upper tiers where the nobles and the elites lived away from the thong. She would replenish her 'Need' in preparation for any others who might cross her path, her hot salty stream a means of subjugating the living and marking the souls of those deceased. Her piss was a means of appeasing the dark gods who the Fel served, their ethereal spirits dining on the ashes of the fallen and the enslaved.<br><br>The Fel assassin moved on, slipping through the shadows whilst seemingly impervious to the rain lashing at her sodden disguise. The guarded gates that barred her way into the Echelon District proved little obstacle for those that secured them were male and thus susceptible to seduction. She shed her beggar's disguise as she moved out of the darkness and into the well of light offered by the guttering torches above the gateway. Naked and alone, her tits and pussy on full display, it was not surprising that it took scant moments for the guards to appear. Thinking her a victim of rape they rushed to offer comfort only to discover death. She killed them both barehanded. She squatted over the first, pissing into the man's mouth as she forced it open to accept her lightly coloured urine stream. The second guard was a woman, the legions of the Trenasruine comprised of both genders. The Fel woman stripped her bare to better familiarise herself with the offering on hand, before squatting over the dead woman's chest and pissing over her exposed nipples. With her act of supplication complete she stood and began to don her latest disguise; that of the slain guard's attire. Once done, she moved the bodies into hiding and then slipped through the open gates.<br><br>The temple section was not difficult to locate even for a stranger to the city. The rain was easing as she approached the frescoed plaza that contained a centralised water fountain boarded by a waist high wall of ornately carved stone. The Fel amazon removed her helmet and bent down to drink. The water was chilled and with her refined senses she could tell that it contained the slightest inkling of urine. Given that the servants of the false gods of the Trenasruine were solely female, it created a wonderful supposition. Keen to experience the sensation for herself she removed the belt from around her waist thus allowing her leggings to fall away.<br><br>She turned about, allowing her wide naked bum cheeks to slide over the marble edge, her pussy moving into a position so that when she peed, her hot precious urine stream would fall and mix with the drinking water. A soft hiss arising from between her thighs accompanied her act, the sound of her pissing a most delicious accompaniment that suitably masked the approach of the arriving acolyte. The Fel assassin looked up from where she had been watching herself pee into the water, to quickly assess the threat level posed by the new arrival. Her position was precarious, one shout enough to alert countless guards to her position.<br><br>The Trenasruine acolyte was a stunning beauty even by Fel standards. She was doe eyed, with large hazel orbs that were wide open at the sight of what she thought to be a common guard, relieving herself into the ornate fountain. Her dress was white yet translucent due to the rain. The Fel amazon could clearly see the woman's large, sumptuous breasts not to mention the triangular mass of black pubes nestled between her creamy thighs.<br><br>For several tense seconds nothing was said. The pee issuing from the squatting Fel assassin's muff had vanished the moment she had detected the new arrival. Still, she remained in her compromising position, the curly hairs of her red haired pussy on clear display. There were many Fel customs about the display of pissing, yet to a stranger and an enemy at that, there was little council.<br><br>Suddenly, the attractive young acolyte flashed a conspiratorial role before saying something in her native tongue that was lost to the assassin. The meaning behind her words became abundantly clear a moment later as she bent and grabbed the hem of her sodden dress, pulling it upwards to reveal her nudity in all her glory. Tossing aside her garment she went to join what she thought to be a most daring city guard, sliding her peach-like buttocks over the fountain's marble wall until she too was in a position to relieve her pent-up piss into the drinking waters beneath her derriere.<br><br>Two hot streams of flowing piss began to desecrate the holy waters of the temple fountain as both woman began to pee, their hot streams jetting from their pussy lips. The Fel Amazon was amazed at the willingness of the temple guardian to willingly participate in such a deed. It went against everything that the Fel had learnt about the Trenasruine during their secret infiltrations into the cities of their foe. It was then as she reached the end of her pee that the Fel woman realised that her companion's gaze had not once strayed from the sight of her pissing pussy whilst she had urinated. For the amazon woman it was a most arousing turn of events, her own gaze having likewise been fixed upon the sight of her companion's pee shower as she had emptied herself into the water.<br><br>The piss flowing from the slits of the two woman came to an end. There was a tense moment as they finished, their gaze locked into the eyes of the other. The acolyte said something in her strange tongue, her words like honey. She then bent forward, her lips succulent, warm and soft as she offered her first kiss. It was in this moment that the Fel assassin forgot her role, returning the offered affection even as one hand moved to caress the other woman's closest tit, her thumb gently massaging the erect nipple. An answering hand sought out the wetness between her legs, a slow press as a questing finger plunged into her pussy hole. The Fel woman should have given answer to such an affront for it was not her way, yet sat squatting on a marble wall over which she had just been peeing, it was an amorous advance that could only be answered in one way...<br><br><i>The End ?</i></p>`,
