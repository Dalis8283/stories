                The last days of term were different, you could feel it in the air, a sense of playfulness and excitement at the freedom just days away. The bell went and we shuffled into the corridor, in moments it was bustling with teenagers eager to be anywhere but here. With John and Derry on either side of me, we headed for the exit. Behind us, I could hear Janessa, Clea, and Trish calling out to us. The three of us had been watching pantsing vines and Derry usually quiet and thoughtful with his words blurted out “Would be fun if we made one”<br><br>“I’m in,” I said excitedly and added “But who?”<br><br>“Maybe Trish” replied John, it was no surprise to us he’d chosen her, as he’d had a crush on her since we’d known him. I looked over my shoulder and saw Janessa had broken free of the throng and was headed towards us.<br><br>“How about Janessa?” I said tossing my phone to John, “Make sure you get this” and nodded to the others. Janessa leapt up and wrapped her legs around a now unsurprised Derry who locked his arms around hers. I slowed my walk and within seconds I was a few paces behind, John matched my movements, camera pointed and ready. I crept up behind and grabbed at the waistband of Janessa’s sweatpants, as my fingers slipped inside she knew immediately my intentions and tried to jump down from Derry’s back, I pulled as hard as I could, they came down easily, too easily and I flew back pulling Janessa with me, she looked like Superman. The sweatpants slipped over her big sneakers with surprising ease causing me to stumble backward and lose my balance my prize slipping out of my hands and flying back over my head and into the crowd behind us, lost forever.<br><br>I looked up excited to see my victim exposed on the floor in front of me clad in tiny panties, my imagination running wild, Clea’s voice laughed out behind me “What the fuck are you wearing them underneath your sweats for?” I looked up hoping to find some embarrassing girlie panties only to see some black yoga pants, my disappointment etched on my face.<br><br>“Jeez, how tight are they? You might as well be naked” Said Trish<br><br>“Maybe that's the idea,” Said John hopefully<br><br>. “Oh haha I was going to go for a run when I got in and this saves time!” exclaimed a flustered Janessa who was now glaring at me “Finished? You little pervert” She flicked out her leg attempting to catch my general off guard, I dropped to one knee feigning injury, “Oh god Josh I’m so sorry I only meant to give them a little tap” looking down at me she saw the intent in my eye and took off like a gazelle. She had a head start but being on one knee meant I was able to spring up like a sprinter, she was quick as you’d expect that from a track star but this was a tightly pack corridor full of teens, and navigating the throng negated her speed advantage and I caught her easily, reaching out the tips of my fingers I flicked at the waistband, one finger, two, now all four had worked their way inside, I could feel her skin against my fingers, it was like being swallowed up by a wave, the excitement making my heart beat faster. I was losing my grip as she pulled away, I waited and swatted at her grounded leg, it was just enough to make her lose balance as it slipped. As she fell the yoga pants peeled downwards, her short T-Shirt meant there was nothing covering her ass as I pulled and she shrieked as more and more flesh was exposed to the crowd “Josh stop, I’m sorry I’m sorry” But I barely heard her, so caught in the moment I just tugged and tugged. She rolled over and sat upright on her ass. I kept pulling the pants were not coming off, they’d got stuck on her sneakers and I panicked. Not knowing what else to do I just pulled them straight as I could and tied them in a knot so she couldn’t pull them back up.<br><br>Janessa looked up at us, Clea and Trish standing next to me while John, still filming was trying to get better shots. Janessa was following John and the camera as he walked all around her, her hands trying to cover her ass and crotch, the only covering was a red g-string “Look your panties now match the colour of your face” Beamed Clea, who seemed to be enjoying this as much as me. Janessa grabbed the knotted leggings and began to try and undo the knot,<br><br>“WTF Josh, did you have to do it so tight, I can’t, it’s not coming undone” she shrieked<br><br>“Oh dear” beamed Trish, Clea had wrapped her arm in mine and whispered quietly<br><br>“Not finished are you? Her smile stretched from ear to ear, we’d been friends since kindergarten, and lately unknown to everyone else we’d sort of become more than friends “I thought this was what you fantasize about” All I could manage was an incoherent mumble but she persisted “Then why are you stopping now?” regaining my senses I replied<br><br>“I thought you weren’t into this”<br><br>“I wasn’t when you showed me, but seeing her like this” she paused and looked in my eye making sure I knew what she implied “exciting!” I needed no more encouragement<br><br>“What is it you’re planning?” embarrassed with how eager I was to continue, Clea gave me a sly grin<br><br>“Just get her to the bus, let her think this is over” then she was gone, picking up the embarrassed and stricken Janessa and heaving her to her feet. She looked so funny waddling forwards, she couldn’t get the leggings back up and she couldn’t get them over her sneakers so all she could do was a weird hop waddle walk, the rabbit backpack bouncing with every step. Laughter rang out around us as Trish and Clea ushered her out the doors and into warm air “Oh god there’s so many people out here!”<br><br>“We’re going to miss the back seat at this rate” Derry exclaimed, and with that, he scooped her up over his shoulder, her ass now fully on display to any ahead of us “MOVE, MOVE SEMI NAKED GIRL COMING THROUGH” shouted Derry as loud as possible making sure every head outside turned to see the commotion.<br><br>“DERRY, DERRY” Janessa screamed making it worse but he was off and reached the bus doors, high-fiving Otto the bus driver on his way past. And dropped Janessa down in a seat in front of him at the back.<br><br>When I got caught them up she had her head down and was vainly trying to undo the knot, “Clea help me get this undone please before the bus fills up sweaty 14-year-old boys”<br><br>The backpack now on the seat next to her<br><br>“We’ll have to take your sneakers off, it's the only way,” she said from behind me<br><br>“Is there really no other way”<br><br>“Nope they’ll have to come all the way off” Smiled Clea enjoying her friend's embarrassment, kneeling down beside her seat she yanked the sneakers off and sat next to Derry and myself in the corner and slowly began to try and get them apart. By the time the bus was moving she’d slipped the sneakers out of the leggings and popped them down at her feet.<br><br>“What about my pants” she said pleadingly at Clea who’d now opened a window and tossed them out while holding a small piece of material and shut that in the window, “NOOOOOO what are you doing I need those” the leggings, now undone were flapping out the back of the bus and the small piece of material still inside the bus was slowly getting less and less,<br><br>“Better do something quick” Clea smirked nudging me in the ribs, I sat directly behind Janessa who’d now turned around and was kneeling on the seat stretching over trying to reach her leggings. I knew what the nudge meant and reached around Janessa and grabbed the bottom of her T-shirt and pulled it up, Clea grabbed Janessa’s arms, she attempted to wriggle away but it was to late, it slid up her back, my fingers hooked into her sports bra and hauled both items up and off.<br><br>Janessa screamed silently “WHAT ARE YOU DOING I’M NEARLY NAKED” “THIS ISN’T FUNNY, CLEA HOW COULD YOU HELP HIM?” her face was flush red, how no one else had noticed is beyond me. She looked around and sunk back into her seat “Please everyone will see me”<br><br>“I’m just trying to help you get more exposure!” exclaimed Clea,”That’s what you said this morning”<br><br>“I meant on social media, not nude on the back of a school bus while John films me!”<br><br>“Your not naked!” “Not yet anyway,” I said as my hands reached through the gap in the seat and grabbed at one side, Clea then grabbed the other side and we pulled down, gently at first, John jumped up and pointed the camera at her crotch, the material at the front began to slowly creep down, exposing more flesh then the first tuff of pubic hair emerged, Janessa looked pleadingly at us,<br><br>“Christ my brother's creepy friend is watching, I don’t want to be naked in front of him”<br><br>“Just him? Because it looks like your going to be naked in front of everyone” Trish said sarcastically<br><br>She was sat with her ass snug to the back of the seat the material digging into her skin on her hips, her hands now trying to cover up, one hand over her chest and the other between her legs. With that she’d no way of stopping us from pulling harder and harder<br><br>“Don’t, stop, please give me back my top and leggings I’ll do anything” She looked at me and I almost caved in and was about give them back when Clea opened the window, the leggings flew off and down the road and Clea threw the top and bra after it,<br><br>“Too late now!” she looked at me and I knew she what she was saying with her eyes, with my hands still full of panties I pulled hard and they snapped on one side, I snapped the other and whipped them off handing them to Clea who slowly and deliberately tossed them after the rest,<br><br>We all looked at each other, each waiting for one of the others to crack, Derry cracked first and burst out laughing, followed by everyone else, everyone else but Janessa<br><br>“Oh my god Clea FFS, WHY” she was now in panic mode, her face flush red<br><br>“Oh come on its just a bit of fun” scoffed Clea at Janessa’s embarrassment<br><br>“Fun, FUN….really, whats fun about it, I’m naked on the back of a school bus full of horny 14-year-old boys and girls, me 18 and the track star, everyone knows who I am, it’ll be all over school tomorrow” she was incoherent again and almost talking to herself “I’ll never live this down, this is so embarrassing!” shaking her head<br><br>“Well, it's about to be even more embarrassing for you!” I said trying not to laugh<br><br>“HOW COULD THIS BE ANY MORE EMBARRASSING FOR ME?” she said sarcastically<br><br>I waited and looked at the others before mouthing the killer line to her slowly and as sarcastic as she had<br><br>“YOUR ON THE WRONG BUS, YOU LIVE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION” the realization hit her and her face sunk, no words came out of her mouth. Clea reached under the seat and passed Janessa her sneakers,<br><br>“You’ll be needing these I think” she smirked from ear to ear<br><br>Slipping on her sneakers and steeling herself for the shrieks and catcalls to come, she took one last look at Clea and myself before streaking up the bus to howls and whistles, teenage boys reaching for their phones, hoping to record the nude girl all of them were probably seeing for the first time. Halfway down the bus she turned and headed back, the view was delicious, pouting and red faced Janessa's hands covered herself as best she could, she stopped and tried to look as dignified as she could whilst naked, paused, then uncovered her breasts and grabbed her rabbit backpack and put it on. She turned and was gone.<br><br>I watched as Janessa’s ass disappeared up the bus and off, and as we pulled away we turned and watched the naked Janessa until she was out of view. I knew I wanted this again and now I had a silent accomplice willing to help me. Summer was going to be great.
