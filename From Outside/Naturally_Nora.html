        title: "Chapter 1: Sword over Snowmore",
        content: "The spirit of her blade belongs only to a single, courageous soul.<br><br><br>Nora looked down the path they'd been crossing. She tried to ignore the sheer drop back towards Snowmore, but her anxieties steered her eyes towards their home village. She yelped and wrapped herself tightly around Annie, who only huffed in response. ‚Ä∂We're nearly there now,‚Ä∂ she assured her, prying her free and marching further up the pass. ‚Ä∂C'mon.‚Ä∂<br><br><br>‚Ä∂Okay‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ Nora muttered to herself. Considering the cold weather surrounding them, Annie was rather casually dressed, with only a furry poncho over her regular tunic. Nora herself wore a full mammoth-skin coat over hers, and wrapped her glasses to her ears for extra measure. They fogged up in the air, but she could still just about see through them. ‚Ä∂Why does it have to be so high up?‚Ä∂ she whimpered.<br><br><br>‚Ä∂It's a sword that bestows a warrior's spirit onto the wielder,‚Ä∂ Annie replied, helping Nora up an icy slope. ‚Ä∂Think about it. It shouldn't just be used by any old wimp. They have to really,‚Ä∂ she whispered into Nora's ear as she passed, ‚Ä∂really, want to be brave.‚Ä∂ She looked further ahead, and was met with the open mouth of Syvan's Tomb. ‚Ä∂This was your idea, remember?‚Ä∂<br><br><br>‚Ä∂Yeah, I know‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ Nora muttered. She often resented how casual Annie was about invading marauders and how everyone her age could so easily pick up an axe to fight them off, including the matrons. A part of her wanted to join in, just so she wouldn't be left out of everything. But whatever gut instinct they had, she was simply born without. ‚Ä∂I‚Ä¶ I have to do this.‚Ä∂<br><br><br>Annie chuckled. ‚Ä∂That's the bravest thing I've heard you say.‚Ä∂ Her march stopped next to the tomb's mouth. ‚Ä∂The Lionheart Sword waits for you, Nora.‚Ä∂<br><br><br>Nora looked at the tomb, at the small glint of light deep within, and took a deep breath. ‚Ä∂Here we go,‚Ä∂ she whispered, giving Annie a look. Her friend returned a look of encouragement and a warm, reassuring smile. ‚Ä∂Okay.‚Ä∂ She bit her lip, and willed herself to step into Syvan's Tomb.<br><br><br>‚Ä∂Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?‚Ä∂ said Annie as shadows started to fall over Nora.<br><br>‚Ä∂Yes, I'm sure,‚Ä∂ Nora answered in a tone that said she most definitely wasn't. ‚Ä∂This is‚Ä¶ this is something I‚Ä¶ that I have to do alone.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Okay then, if you say so,‚Ä∂ said the blonde with an understanding nod. ‚Ä∂Just‚Ä¶ don't get in over your head, alright? Be brave, not stupid. Too many people mistake one of being the other, and believe me, I've got the scars to prove it.‚Ä∂ She reached towards her sleeve to unveil the scars in question, but a sudden chilly gust stayed her hand. Nora knew what she meant.<br><br>‚Ä∂I'll be fine,‚Ä∂ said Nora as she tried to force a chuckle at her friend's self-deprecating joke. It ended up sounding more like an awkward cough. No matter. She was here, at the Tomb of Syvan, where the solution to all her problems was a hop-skip away from her. She could do this one little thing, she could brave these ruins regardless how much her shaking legs told her not to.<br><br>Her footsteps echoed ominously as she descended the stone stairs. She tried not to shudder with every tack that rang through her ears, but it was difficult. The tomb was dark and ancient, untouched by human hands for presumably centuries. Anything could be lurking within its shadowy recesses, and Nora wasn't so sure she was prepared for them.<br><br>She stopped to take a deep breath and center herself. She hadn't even taken a dozen steps and already she was over-thinking things. She absolutely needed to stop doing that. Over-thinking would lead to uncertainty, uncertainty would lead to fear, and fear would lead her‚Ä¶ back the way she came, both literally and figuratively. And if she so much as glanced behind her, to the entrance, she feared she would lose her chance, and this opportunity to finally find her courage would forever slip through her fingers.<br><br>I fear going forward‚Ä¶ and I fear going back. Nora couldn't help but chuckle sadly at the thought. It seemed that no matter what she did, fear and cowardice would always dominate her thoughts and dictate her actions. Damn it, you're doing it again! she scolded herself with an angry shake of her head. Just blank it out Nora. Count to ten. Focus on the numbers. Only on the numbers...and keep walking. One.<br><br>She descended another step.<br><br>Two. Step.<br><br>Three. Four. Step. Step.<br><br>Five. Six. Seven. Step. Step. Step.<br><br>Eight...nine...ten!<br><br>She exhaled loudly as her foot came down for the last time on what was coincidentally the final step of the staircase. She did it! She managed to get her quivering little behind all the way down these stairs and into Syvan's Tomb proper despite herself. Score one for Nora! Unfortunately, the light from the entrance was now faint; all that lay before her now was the ever present darkness. Well, that and the small glint of light in the distance, but that wouldn't be enough to light the way.<br><br>Thankfully, this was one thing Nora was prepared for. Reaching into the pouch by her side, she withdrew a vial of Moonlit Essence. A creation of alchemy, it was a very useful substance for providing illumination where no other light could shine. It was lighter than a torch and much safer too, provided you didn't inhale too many of its fumes, though it was admittedly a bit pricey. Not too pricey for Nora though; truth was, she didn't think anything would be too high a price for her if it would get her the warrior's spirit she yearned so much for. After giving the vial a small shake, the bespectacled girl popped off its cork and held it up in the air. True to form, light began to emanate from it, faint at first, but more intensely over time until the area around her was bathed in a gentle blue glow. Now able to see properly, the girl gave the Moonlit Essence a satisfying nod and continued walking.<br><br>As expected, Syvan's Tomb was eerie, but nothing about it was that out of the ordinary, at least so far. Cold grey stone marked every inch of the chamber she was in, empty save for the pillars that held up the ceiling on either side. As Nora passed by them, however, she noticed that each one had unique sculpture carved into its every side. In one pillar there was a set of knights wearing fearsome-looking suits of armour that no human hand could have possibly forged. In another were horrid beasts that vaguely resembled wolves, albeit larger and more monstrous, as though they crawled out from the underworld itself. One bore the visage of a man, stern-faced and wearing a crown that indicated he must have been a king. One held a chimera with three bestial heads snarling viciously. And yet another contained the heads of a dragon, each bearing its teeth as though they were getting ready to bellow or let loose their fiery breaths of death.<br><br>Nora couldn't help but tilt her head curiously at them. She didn't know what the story behind these carvings was, but it had to be something amazing because someone put a lot of time and effort into their creation. The craftsmanship was exquisite, so detailed that you could count every individual hair and scale in the figures. She even had half a mind to do just that, to examine and take in every stroke of artistic genius carved into this tomb.<br><br>Clearly Syvan had left a great, sprawling legacy behind her, etched permanently into every inch of her tomb.<br><br>Nora set her foot down and heard something crack beneath her. Looking in its direction, she saw that it had once been some sort of hollow white globe. And attached to that now shattered white globe was the grinning, ghastly face of a human skull.<br><br>‚Ä∂AH!‚Ä∂ Nora cried and fell backward on her rear, letting loose a low rumble that echoed all throughout the tomb. The girl whimpered pathetically at the sound and attempted to curl herself up into a ball before stopping to rail at her stupidity. ‚Ä∂It's just a skull,‚Ä∂ she muttered. ‚Ä∂A stupid, inanimate, and now broken skull. It's ugly and it's creepy, but it can't hurt you. It can't‚Ä¶ hurt anyone anymore.‚Ä∂<br><br>Still, as she pushed herself up, she couldn't help but feel more pangs of doubt overcome her. ‚Ä∂But‚Ä¶ what if something hurt‚Ä¶ it?‚Ä∂ she asked. Shining her light upon the skull, she could see it was still very attached to the rest of its bones. Wrapped up in tattered rags, furs, and bits of metal, it was easy to see that the skeleton was not one of the people buried in this tomb, but another adventurer who had come to explore its recesses and plunder its treasures. Just like her. And it wasn't the only one. Casting her gaze all around the chamber, the girl saw the floor was riddled with the remains of what had to be at least a dozen people. Nora shuddered as the realization came over her. People had died in this tomb. Which meant there was a very real possibility that she was going to die in here too.<br><br>She glanced back toward the stairs. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe she should go back after all. Maybe she should ask Annie to come into the tomb with her. Nora was clearly getting in over her head going into this place all by herself, and it honestly wasn't a big deal. Annie had already come this far escorting Nora to the Tomb of Syvan. What was a couple hundred more feet? But no, that wasn't an option, not really. As Annie said, the Lionheart Sword would only open itself up to someone who truly wanted to be brave, and if Nora wanted to claim it for herself, she had to push forward no matter how afraid she was.<br><br>Now granted, she didn't know for a fact if she really needed to proceed into the depths of Syvan's Tomb by herself. She had no idea what the trials to take it were, or if there even were any. All she had were rumors and legends to go by, each stating that the Lionheart could only ever go to ‚Ä∂a single courageous soul.‚Ä∂ When it came to legends, you never took any chances; you either abided by the terms they set, however vaguely worded they were, or paid the price. Nora had learned that much from her many studies of fools who tried and failed to defy the mythical.<br><br>But even if there wasn't a true trial to this particular legend, there was very much one in Nora's head. One that she desperately wanted to pass, if only to prove she wasn't such a craven coward after all. Turning back just once for any reason would prove she truly was without a shadow of a doubt, and that she absolutely positively did not want to become nearly as brave as she thought she did. And if she wasn't worthy of the Lionheart in her mind, how could she expect herself to be worthy of the Lionheart period?<br><br>‚Ä∂Keep moving. I have to keep moving,‚Ä∂ she said, doing her best to ignore both the skeletal remains all around her as well as the rapid palpitations in her heart. ‚Ä∂Nothing worth having is ever easy... and if the Lionheart Sword was really that easy to get, it would have been claimed a long time ago.‚Ä∂<br><br>So she marched forward, out of the hall and toward the light. She came upon another set of stairs, narrower than the previous ones and with walls packed awfully close together on either side of them. Looking at them was making her feel awfully claustrophobic, like they would close in and crush her if she dared to take a step between them. But they were just walls, yes? Just very narrow walls. They couldn't hurt her either. And unlike the previous chamber, there were no skeletal remains to be found. So if anything, this staircase had to be safer, right?<br><br>That's what she told herself as she began her second descent in the tomb anyway, walking with careful measured steps on every individual stair, treading lightly as if each one was a trap threatening to end her career as a warrior before it had a chance to begin. She inhaled deeply each time she lifted a foot in the air, and exhaled just as harshly as it came to rest on the next stone platform. Up, down, inhale, exhale, on and on it went as she marched down the stairwell, expecting every new breath and every new step she took to be her last.<br><br>How long does this go on? she thought, chewing her lip nervously. Even in the cold, she could feel her body working up a sweat just from the sheer amount of stress coursing through her. Shucking off her heavyset mammoth coat sounded oddly appealing; it would do much to cool the nervous heat building up in her body... so with a big shrug of her shoulders, that's what she did, letting it fall to the floor in a pile. ‚Ä∂Ahh,‚Ä∂ she murmured. That felt so much better. She was still a bit warm from the lingering trepidation, but at least it wasn't like she was sitting in a sauna anymore.<br><br>A sauna, eh? Thinking about that made her start pawing on her tunic. Perhaps she could relax a little if she dressed further down for a moment? No, no, that was ridiculous. She wasn't at home in Snowmore; she was in a forbidden tomb and very much in danger. As unpleasant as it was, she needed to be on edge, she couldn't afford to relax, not until she was out of here. So she marched forward, leaving the coat behind. She'd retrieve once she made the return trip out of here. If she made the return trip out of here.<br><br>At least the light ahead of her was getting brighter. That was good. It meant she was getting nearer. As long as she was moving‚Äîand living‚Äîshe was getting closer to her goal. But it did little to calm her fraying nerves.<br><br>Nora whimpered sadly. Did they really have to build the tomb like this? Did they really have to make these walls so narrow? She glanced to her right to gaze at one of the walls that seemingly felt like it was closing in on her‚Ä¶ and froze in her tracks. What she saw before her wasn't just some blank grey slab; it was a work of art! Carved into the stone was a massive relief sculpture stretching from the floor to the ceiling. It depicted a trio of monstrous orcs menacing the viewer in a springtime forest. And in the foreground could be seen a pair of hands clutching a sword brandished threateningly in the direction of the monsters. The Lionheart.<br><br>‚Ä∂Wow,‚Ä∂ Nora whispered as she ran a hand over the relief, tracing the outlines of the orcs with her fingers and then the blade itself. Like the carvings in the chamber above, the artistry in the relief was detailed and masterful. More than that, its choice of perspective put the viewer directly into the scene, as though she was actually in that forest, as though she was staring down those horrible beasts, as though she was holding that sword. Nora held her own hands up to pantomime the act of holding a sword in them at the exact same angle the faceless warrior in the relief was: brave, bold, fearless, and‚Ä¶ lionhearted.<br><br>She looked to her left, in the direction she was going. There was another such carving there, featuring a similar scene of the warrior crossing blades with a knight on horseback. She looked to her right, in the direction she had come from. She saw the image of the warrior held in the hand of a giant ape, raising the sword up in a motion to hack the arm off the fiend. In the distance, she saw yet another relief that she passed by without noticing, though from her current angle, she couldn't make out what it was supposed to be, but she had a good idea what it was: another depiction of a battle fought and won by the mighty lady warrior, Syvan.<br><br>‚Ä∂Syvan... I wonder what kind of person she was?‚Ä∂ said Nora as she continued forward, gluing her eyes to the wall to take in each new work of art chiseled into it. She was not disappointed. She saw men and beasts of all shapes and sizes bearing down on her. Legions of men in exotic armor charging her, centaurs with bows held taught, a griffin swooping down from the air, and the tentacles of a kraken rising up from the sea. The people were frightening, the beasts were fierce... but nothing could compare to Syvan. Just by looking at her hands, the only parts of her shown in any of the reliefs, Nora couldn't help but wonder what the story behind her was. Who was she? Where did she come from? How did she become such an exceptional warrior? And more than that, was she born courageous, or did she have to learn it over time? Staring at the images of her past exploits, Nora soon realized there was absolutely nothing about this woman she didn't want to know about.<br><br>Before she knew it, Nora fell upon the final step and with it, the final relief. It was a frightening image, depicting an army of inhuman demons roaring fiercely in a fiery hellscape. And in the center of the carving was a great multi-headed serpent rising from the earth, spewing fire from each of its heads. Was it the scene of Syvan's most triumphant victory yet? Or was it the battle where she finally met her end? Nora didn't know, and she doubted she ever would. But there was one thing she did know: whoever Syvan was, she was a figure who was regarded not with respect by the people who built this tomb, but with reverence.<br><br>‚Ä∂I couldn't ever hope to be like her,‚Ä∂ said Nora wistfully. ‚Ä∂But if I could just have a shard of her courage, a tiny, little fragment‚Ä¶ that would be‚Ä¶ that would be enough.‚Ä∂<br><br>As she shuffled her feet to turn away from the work of art, Nora nearly tripped when she felt something loose on the floor clatter against her boots. Something in her head warned her to by all that was heavenly not look down, but alas, she couldn't resist herself. She regretted it immediately. It was another skull. A few feet away were the headless remains of its body, another tomb raider, and scattered all over the floor were the dried remains of others just like him.<br><br>‚Ä∂Oh gods, oh gods, oh gods‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ she murmured, stumbling backwards in fright. More bodies, more people, more adventurers and thieves who had died trying to steal the treasures of Syvan's Tomb. Just like she was trying to do. What killed them? What could have possibly killed them? Were there any traps? No, she couldn't see any, but then, a good trap was one you never saw until it was too late. Were there any monsters lurking around these halls? No, she didn't see or hear any of those either, but then again, like a good trap, a good predator never alerts its prey until it's too late. Was there any sign of magic? Just the big, glowing blue gem in the giant stone doors on the other side, but that‚Äî<br><br>Wait... big glowing blue gem?<br><br>The glimmer of light at the end of the tomb! She had reached it! Nora had powered her way through this creepy ruin and reached what was clearly its innermost sanctum. If she didn't know any better, the Lionheart Sword was likely right behind those massive double doors! Her journey‚Ä¶ was nearly over!<br><br>She glanced nervously at the skull she nearly tripped over. Yes, her journey was indeed nearly over. Just like it had been for this poor sod and his friend over there, and his friend over there, and all their fellow brothers and sisters near the entrance. They had all been a stone's throw away from achieving their goal, and they had all met the same gruesome end. How was Nora going to be different in that regard? Maybe...maybe it was better to cut her losses and turn back.<br><br>She took a step back towards the stairs where she had come from before screwing her eyes shut. No. No, I'm not going to give up right here, not when the sword is right in front of me! Annie and everyone else stare death in the face all the time when they take up arms and fight. If I want to be like them‚Ä¶  then I have to do the same!<br><br>Nora spun on her heel and faced the glowing doors. She stared at them and especially at the gem in their center. The gem stared back at her, impassively, almost with boredom, as did the statues on either side of it.<br><br>Wait, statues?<br><br>Yes, there were statues, and now that Nora was paying attention, she finally noticed them. They stood like sentinels guarding the room before her, holding their swords at their sides ready to fend off any and all intruders. She assumed they had been mirror images of one another, but she couldn't be fully sure because the one on the left was quite damaged, missing its head, an arm, and half its chest. But the other was in nearly pristine condition.<br><br>It was a woman. A nude woman, standing tall and proud in her completely natural state. Her body was fit and muscular, her breasts were large and full, and her face looked strong and resolute. If she was aware that she was naked, she showed no sign of it, looking as fierce and battle-ready as the most combat-hardened veterans Nora had ever seen at home. There was nothing vulnerable about her; no, if anything, her nakedness made her all the more imposing for it allowed Nora to drink in every single muscle that seemed to ripple across the amazon's whole body.<br><br>For the umpteenth time that day, Nora found herself enraptured by the artistry of the tomb. The craftsmanship of the statue was, like everything else here, absolutely masterful. The detail in the amazon's anatomy, how her muscles stretched and flexed with her stance, was nothing short of impeccable. She hardly looked like she was made of stone. She looked like she could have been a real person, who at any moment could leave her sigil, walk around, swing her sword, strike up a conversation, whatever. Unconsciously, Nora found herself drawing closer to the statue, running her hands over its surface just to confirm that yes, it was indeed just a sculpture.<br><br>She was only more impressed as she felt it up. She traced the muscles on the figure's back, feeling all the contours of her taut muscles. She cupped the amazon's bulbous bare behind, which she could tell was no less detailed just from touch alone. It was unlikely anyone would ever be able to see that part of the woman's body, but the artist still went the extra mile to carve both cheeks with loving care. Looking at the statue up close, Nora could pick up even more details, such as how tendons and veins bulged realistically from the warrior's hands and wrists, her nipples stood tall and erect atop her breasts, her stomach was pulled inward as though she had drawn in her breath to puff out her chest, and her sex...Nora had to run a delicate hand over the statue's groin just to confirm that, yes, even her sex had been rent into the stone, a poofy pair of lips that opened slightly, giving anyone a chance to peer into and feel her chilly little insides...<br><br>Nora stopped herself when she realized what she was doing. She was just admiring the raw talent that had been put into the making of this sculpture, but to an outside observer, it looked more like she was doing something‚Ä¶ a lot naughtier. Oh, if Annie saw Nora right now, she'd never let her hear the end of it.<br><br> ‚Ä∂Nora, I didn't know you swung that way!‚Ä∂ she would probably say. ‚Ä∂And hey, I've never seen anyone desecrate a tomb quite like that before! Looks like you have guts after all! Better be careful, 'cause you're definitely gonna get haunted for this.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂As if,‚Ä∂ Nora muttered with a nervous chuckle as she backed away from the statue, which continued to stare determinedly forward. Though as silly as she had been acting, the girl had to admit she was feeling better now. Nora didn't know why, but just being around the work of art had helped to ease her nerves. The woman was strong, beautiful, and more than anything else, courageous. She was everything Nora was most decidedly not. But if she tried, if she pushed forward just a little bit more, perhaps the bespectacled girl too could be just like her. Turning her attention back to the gem on the large double doors, Nora nodded and stepped forward, ready to achieve her destiny."

        title: "Chapter 2: The Warrior's Spirit",
        content: "Nora marched towards the blue gem, seeing her face appear on its surface at her approach. As she did, a crack ran through it, splitting it in halves, both cut neatly into its corresponding door. The lock was broken. For a moment, that was it. The door still wouldn‚Äôt move, even if they weren‚Äôt sealed shut any longer. Has anyone made it beyond these doors? Nora asked herself. What if somebody‚Äôs already been here, and taken the sword for themselves?<br><br>Then, something shuddered. Nora could feel a tremor through her boots, as the doors slowly slid open. The damaged statue‚Äôs surviving arm pointed into the room behind it, as did the nude woman‚Äôs, with even her finger carrying an authority of its own. When the gap between doors grew large enough, she saw a small, metallic thing rising from the centre of the room. This was where her finger aimed. This was her command.<br><br>Nora looked up at the statue as she passed. ‚Ä∂Thank you‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ she whispered, before running into the chamber.<br><br>A single light shone from the ceiling, illuminating the lone sword at the heart of it. Nora couldn‚Äôt see anything else of note in the chamber. It was large, circular, with its own impressive stonework in the floor and walls. Getting a closer look with her Moonlit Essence, Nora was met with the vista of all the same beasts from before. The orcs, demons, and the big ape among their ranks. All facing her, down on one knee, their heads all lowered in reverence. Even the most formidable opponents from the earlier carvings, bowed in respect.<br><br>Her attention returned to the sword.<br><br>Her heart beat wildly as she got a closer look at the weapon. The hilt was deceptively simple, with two snake heads forming the shaft connecting the blade, and a single ruby made up the pommel. She reached out to it, her hand shaking wildly as it got nearer and nearer. ‚Ä∂I‚Äôm about to touch the sword,‚Ä∂ she gasped out loud as her fingers closed in around the object. ‚Ä∂Oh my gods, I‚Äôm actually touching the sword!‚Ä∂<br><br>Her fingers wrapped around the hilt. Nora‚Äôs heart almost exploded. Her whole body trembled with excitement as she slowly pulled. The blade slid out of the floor easily and gracefully, with a small, pleasing screech against the stone. She could see her face reflected in the steel, and how flush it had become since her arrival. Here she was, meek Nora, scaredy Nora, the biggest wimp in all of Snowmore Village, wielding the most formidable sword in the land.<br><br>The sword slid free from its resting place. Nora held it in both hands, realising how light it felt. How comfortable it was to just hold in just one hand. Her face lit up.<br><br>---<br><br>Annie waited by the tomb entrance, spinning the axe in her hand, half out of boredom and half out of trepidation. This was not the first time she had passed by the ruin, but it was the closest she had ever physically been to it. She couldn‚Äôt explain why, but something about the tomb rubbed her the wrong way. Every time she tried to steal a glance into its cavernous maw, she would always feel a sudden rush of dread in her heart that told her to turn back, that this was no place for her, that she would find no treasure or glory here; only finality. <br><br>‚Ä∂It‚Äôs so bizarre,‚Ä∂ she muttered. ‚Ä∂I could take on marauders, orcs, golems and all sorts without breaking a sweat. But the thought of going inside there just screws with my head. And yet Nora didn‚Äôt hold back. I couldn‚Äôt stop her.‚Ä∂<br><br>Indeed, since Nora caught wind of the tomb‚Äôs legend, and the existence of the Lionheart Sword, she became more assertive than usual, insisting to her father that she be allowed to check it out. Yesterday, he finally caved. He was probably a bit scared that his daughter, the pitiful mouse she was, wanted something so badly as a sword. ‚Ä∂Well, whatever,‚Ä∂ he probably said. ‚Ä∂Maybe Annie can train you in sword fighting if you do find it.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Maybe the legend is true,‚Ä∂ she muttered. ‚Ä∂If just hearing about the sword does that to you, then imagine what it does to someone who actually finds it.‚Ä∂ She could only hope. Nora so desperately wanted to be a warrior, and Annie in turn wanted her to be happy. And if this legendary sword just so happened to be the key to giving Nora that injection of courage she needed, Annie would gladly support her. Even if her own gut instinct told her it was a bad idea.<br><br>As she mulled it over, a high, shrill scream rang through the tomb. Annie jumped back in shock. Nora? That scream turned into a demented laugh, and back into a scream again. <br><br>‚Ä∂EEEEEEEEEEEEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeee‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Hold on, Nora!‚Ä∂ Annie cried, running into the tomb. Gut instinct couldn‚Äôt stop her from doing that.<br><br>---<br><br>Nora stood there for about five minutes, still holding the sword in her hands, beholding her reflection in the blade. This was real. She was holding the Lionheart Sword. Syvan‚Äôs legendary sword. It was in her hands. It was hers. She was the ‚Ä∂Single, Courageous Soul‚Ä∂ the legend spoke about. She laughed again, and tried swinging it about in the air.<br><br>She tried a single slice first, holding it in her left hand. The woosh it made felt incredibly satisfying to her. Then, she tried spinning it in a circle, flailing the blade in the space around her. Though it all looked and felt very ungainly to begin with, as she practiced, Nora could feel herself getting better. Before long, she was holding the hilt in both hands, and her slices were growing in reach and effort. She slammed the blade into the floor with a cry of aggression.<br><br>As she caught her breath, Nora noticed the blade lying pointed towards the floor, still in her hands. For a small moment, everything just blurred together. She stopped paying attention to the movements of her sword and let her hands do the moving for her. ‚Ä∂Did I just do that?‚Ä∂ she asked out loud.<br><br>She picked up the sword again, the tip pointing skywards. ‚Ä∂I need an opponent,‚Ä∂ she said aloud. ‚Ä∂Just to see if I have the bravery to face them.‚Ä∂<br><br>On cue, Nora could feel a shift in the air. An impending presence. A shadow was cast against the walls, growing larger. She turned on her heel just as the presence landed in the centre of the room. The force knocked her off her feet, throwing her against the wall of the chamber. The thing stood there, like a large stone with hands. As it rose, its legs stretching out in length, Nora could make out its shape much better, could see each finely-cut finger, its large, cubic head, and the red, glowing eyes beaming at her.<br><br>Nora‚Äôs first opponent was a golem.<br><br>She got to her feet, but stood transfixed as the golem stomped towards her, flexing his fingers, raising his arms in attack. What am I going to do?! she screamed at herself. How am I meant to attack that thing?! There was a tight window to her right that she could probably slip through, before the golem attacked. As soon as she realised that, Nora took flight, running past the stone beast with the sword, her sword, pointing behind her.<br><br>She heard a loud SNIKT of metal against stone as she passed under the golem‚Äôs arm. She slid to a halt, and realised the sword was now in both her hands again, pointing forwards. Nora paused to catch her breath, turning around in curiosity. What she saw were the golem‚Äôs fingers writhing on the floor, and him clutching what was left of his left hand. ‚Ä∂Did I,‚Ä∂ she realised, ‚Ä∂did I just cut those off?‚Ä∂<br><br>The golem‚Äôs back was against her now, as it cradled its fingerless hand, moaning in agony. For a small moment, Nora considered how weird it was for an artificial, magic-empowered creature like that to feel pain. Before she could put it into words, something about the golem caught her eye. A small slit, in the creature‚Äôs neck. All of a sudden, Nora lost all interest in herself. Her mind zeroed in on that slit, at the opportunity it presented her. Drive the sword in that neck! The words came so naturally to her, with an insistence she didn‚Äôt recognise. That‚Äôs its weakness!<br><br>With a yell, Nora ran towards the back of the golem, sword raised towards the sun. Right, get to the neck, she thought. That‚Äôs how you kill it, I guess. The beast was still hunched over, but was beginning to stand upright. Panicking, Nora leapt to cover the remaining distance. Her feet landed on its back, and‚Ä¶<br><br>Her boots could not grip the brickwork. They slid clean off, and she fell to the floor with a smack. She spun around, running back to get a better look at it. The golem was upright now, slowly lumbering to face her. She noticed how rough the brickwork was; how some stones jutted out by a few key inches. I could grab those, she thought to herself. If I‚Äôd had my hands free, I could‚Äôve grabbed on, and climbed to the neck.<br><br>The golem‚Äôs back left her sight. Ah, but would I have reached it in time? Its glowing face came into view. There‚Äôs no way to stun this thing for very long. It faced her now, its left arm now a crude, fingerless club. What else can I grab those bricks with?<br><br>Nora looked down at her feet, nestled deep in those ankle-high boots of hers. My toes, she wondered. Can they get a better grip on that thing than these? The golem swung at her, which she didn‚Äôt even notice she dodged until she was out of the sunlight. A crude plan was beginning to take shape in her head. With her free hand, Nora tugged off her boots and cast them aside. Her bare feet slammed into the cold, stone ground, sending a chill straight to her brain. ‚Ä∂I can feel it,‚Ä∂ she thought out loud. ‚Ä∂The ground. I can feel all the cracks and-‚Ä∂<br><br>The golem lunged at her with his right, fingered hand. Nora jumped back, narrowly missing it. Seeing the sword in her hands, it pulled its arm away. The colour of its eyes changed to a pale yellow, and it began to step back. Oh, it knows your plan, came another thought. Time for step two.<br><br>Nora ran towards the golem, her bare feet slapping against the floor, her sword held aloft, prepared to strike. The beast may have known what she was trying to do, but it was slow. Just slow enough. She turned right, running just under the right arm. Her blade tipped back, and‚Ä¶<br><br>Another SNIKT, followed by a deep thud, as Nora cleaved the golem‚Äôs right arm clean off. She kept running after that, ending with a leap as she turned around. The beast writhed in pain, its back bared to her once again. That slit in its neck looked more obvious now, more inviting than before. ‚Ä∂Okay,‚Ä∂ she declared out loud. ‚Ä∂Step three!‚Ä∂<br><br>As Nora ran towards the golem, time seemed to slow down. Her sword flailed in her right hand, her legs propelled her along the ground with a force she had not felt before. She became increasingly conscious of what she was doing with every naked footstep towards the golem. I‚Äôm holding the legendary Lionheart Sword, she thought, wielded by the legendary warrior, Syvan. Now, I‚Äôm about to kill an actual golem with this thing. I‚Äôm running towards it barefoot. Should I be scared?<br><br>Her heart seized in realisation. She was terrified. She had never felt such terror in her life before; not even during the big troll raid last summer. This was the scariest, most insane thing she was about to do. Why was she still doing it? Why was her body still charging straight towards the terror?<br><br>Because, this will be my first kill!<br><br>She leapt.<br><br>The golem stood upright once again as she landed. Her toes gripped the loose stones in its back, and Nora sprinted up towards the nape. In just a few seconds, it would be at full height, and probably buck her off. The sword! Get the sword! Remembering the big, steel thing in her right hand, Nora shoved the Lionheart Sword into the slit, and grabbed the hilt in both hands.<br><br>Nothing happened at first. Gripping the golem with her lower half, Nora shoved the blade in deeper, deeper, pushing the hilt with as much strength as she could humanly muster. Inch by inch, it slid in. The golem roared, lashing wildly, stampeding blindly around the room. No doubt, it could feel it working. ‚Ä∂Come on,‚Ä∂ she hissed. ‚Ä∂Come on!‚Ä∂<br><br>She heard a click. The golem‚Äôs charge slowed to a crawl, its footsteps growing heavier and heavier. Then, it toppled forwards, slamming flat into the ground. Nora stayed there, still gripping the hilt for dear life, trying to catch her breath. The golem‚Äôs head detached from the body, and rolled across the floor, its eyes devoid of light.<br><br>It was dead.<br><br>She had killed it.<br><br>Nora stood on its back, trying to process what had just happened. ‚Ä∂I‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ she began with a stammer. ‚Ä∂I just, I j-‚Ä∂ She looked down at the golem she stood on, and the sword in her hands. She screamed in shock, replaying the memories over and over in her head. ‚Ä∂Did I just‚Äîholy crap!‚Ä∂<br><br>She heard something clatter. Peering forwards, she saw a scabbard poking out of the golem‚Äôs neck. She jumped down and picked it up, testing its length against the sword‚Äôs blade. It fit perfectly. This was her reward for killing the golem.<br><br>Nora had passed the test.<br><br>She was the sword‚Äôs Courageous Soul!<br><br>She screamed in triumph, holding the sword in the air, like a true hero would. She followed its glint towards the crack in the roof, and cast her eyes to the light above. ‚Ä∂I did it, Syvan!‚Ä∂ Nora declared. ‚Ä∂I am your champion!‚Ä∂<br><br>Her gaze settled back to ground level, where she saw Annie standing by the entrance, her jaw slack in shock. ‚Ä∂Nora?‚Ä∂ she managed to say.<br><br>‚Ä∂Oh, Annie,‚Ä∂ replied Nora, just as stunned as she was. ‚Ä∂Are you okay?‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie gaped at her friend, open-mouthed and completely dumbfounded. ‚Ä∂Am I okay? Am I okay? Nora, I should be the one asking you‚Ä¶ I mean, I came here because‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ heard‚Ä¶ there was‚Ä¶ WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I did it,‚Ä∂ said Nora, still out of breath, still not quite believing it herself. ‚Ä∂I got the sword. And I killed the golem. It's dead. I killed it. With the sword.‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie could only look around bewildered, at the artwork adorning the chamber, at the crumbled corpse of the golem, now little more than a pile of rock, and at her bespectacled little friend standing amidst it, panting-heavily, red in the face, clutching a fantastic-looking blade in her hands. She had to blink some more, rub her eyes, and pinch herself just to make sure this wasn't some kind of fever dream or hallucination. ‚Ä∂Holy crap.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Exactly what I said,‚Ä∂ said Nora, giggling half-madly to herself.<br><br>‚Ä∂But... but how?‚Ä∂ said Annie. Golems were not opponents to take lightly. They were a popular guardian to enchant and create because they were good at what they did: killing and not getting killed. Someone with no combat experience like Nora wouldn't have stood a chance, and yet here she was right now.<br><br>‚Ä∂It‚Ä¶ it just came naturally to me,‚Ä∂ said Nora. ‚Ä∂I just looked it down with the sword in my hand‚Ä¶ and before I knew it, it was dead.‚Ä∂<br><br> ‚Ä∂I‚Ä¶ see,‚Ä∂ said Annie, staring blankly at the golem's remains. Some of the injuries it sustained shouldn't have been possible, not with a weapon like what Nora was wielding, or with the slender build she was packing. The blonde probably would have been able to break the monster apart with her axe, but not anywhere near as cleanly as her friend had. But then, it is a magic sword. Anything is possible.<br><br>Fatigue finally came over Nora, prompting the small girl to fall onto her knees. Annie was by her side in an instant. ‚Ä∂Whoa, whoa, are you really okay, Nora?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I'm fine,‚Ä∂ said Nora. ‚Ä∂Just a little tired is all. Just give me a few minutes, and I'll be able to walk again.‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie chewed her lip as she looked around the room nervously. Now that the excitement was over, the only feeling she had was the uneasiness of just being inside this tomb. ‚Ä∂No, I don't think we should linger here any longer. C'mon, give me your arm, I'll help you out of here.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Okay, if that's what you want,‚Ä∂ said Nora with a nod. Standing up, she wrapped her arm around her friend's shoulder while Annie curled her own around Nora's waist and together the two exited the chamber that had once housed Syvan's most cherished treasure. Silently, they passed by the statue of the nude woman, still frozen in her pointing gesture. As Nora gave it one final look before she and her companion ascended the stairs, she couldn't help but notice how similar her new sword was to the one the warrior woman was holding. She gave the statue a nod and another quiet word of appreciation.<br><br>Your sword and your legacy is in good hands, Syvan. I won't let you down. I promise.<br><br>In the back of her mind, she realized she didn't have her boots on. They were still in the chamber, lying prone on the ground along with the remains of the golem. But Nora couldn't be bothered to say a word about them. They just seemed so‚Ä¶ unimportant right now. Besides, Annie didn't look like she wanted to be in this tomb for another minute. It was only courteous to respect her wishes.<br><br>---<br><br>The journey out of the tomb thankfully didn't take as long as the journey into it. Within ten minutes, the sun was shining on both girls' faces, and in another five, Nora was good to walk on her own again. Walk she did, with a brisk spring to her step that Annie hadn't seen in a long time. The smaller girl never took her bespectacled eyes off her new sword either. She was constantly flicking her wrist about this way and that way to examine the weapon at every angle, from the blade that gleamed like a beacon in the sun to the intricate craftsmanship in the decorative hilt.  She looked less like a proud warrior of Snowmore and more like a giddy little kid who just got a new toy, what with the excited way she was smiling and running around delightfully, completely barefoot.<br><br>Wait a minute. ‚Ä∂Nora, where the hell are your BOOTS?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I left them in the tomb,‚Ä∂ said Nora matter-of-factly, as if she was commenting on the weather.<br><br>‚Ä∂You left them in the‚Ä¶ Nora why didn't you‚Ä¶ forget that, Nora, why did you take them off?‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie already thought it was odd that her friend had removed her coat in the tomb, but Nora had explained her nerves were heating her up so much that it became unbearable to wear it. That was pretty understandable. Everyone‚Äôs furs got burdensome at some point or another, and there was nothing harmful about removing them temporarily. Annie herself didn‚Äôt really need a mammoth coat either, and they had been able to get it back on the girl‚Äôs shoulders easily enough as they climbed the stairs. But taking off one‚Äôs own footwear, that was something no one ever did.<br><br>‚Ä∂I needed to run up the golem's back, but my feet couldn't get a good grip on it with my boots. So I took them off,‚Ä∂ said Nora.<br><br>‚Ä∂O‚Ä¶ kay, I guess that makes sense,‚Ä∂ said Annie. It sounded like an unconventional tactic, but she would accept it as a valid one if it helped her friend win the fight. ‚Ä∂But still, it was careless to forget them like that. Your toes will freeze off out here, and who knows what you'll step in.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂It's fine. I'm actually kind of‚Ä¶ comfortable like this,‚Ä∂ said Nora, wiggling her bare toes for emphasis. ‚Ä∂Besides, my feet will be okay as long as we keep moving. All this standing around and talking is what's going to freeze them.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Fine, fine, you've made your point,‚Ä∂ said Annie, who decided to just keep on marching forward. ‚Ä∂We'll need to get something to wrap them up in later, so keep your eyes open for anything hairy if you can.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I'll be fine!‚Ä∂ Nora huffed, feeling annoyed at how patronizing her friend was being. Sure, she could understand Annie's concern in the past, when she was a scared little mouse. But Nora was now the holder of the Lionheart Sword. She had a warrior's spirit, and she could handle herself just fine! Sure, the air was cold on her feet and the ground was rough on her soles, but she could handle that slight discomfort just fine. If anything, it was the rest of her body that was starting to bother her. The way her furs and leathers seemed to scrape against her skin was getting‚Ä¶ irritating, like a persistent itch that wouldn't go away. And they still wet and sticky with her sweat from earlier. She hadn't noticed because she was so enraptured by the sword, her very own magical sword, but now that attention had been brought to the unclothed parts of her, Nora now couldn't get her mind off the clothed parts, or how much she wished this tunic of hers wouldn't be so tight around her neck.<br><br>---<br><br>As it turned out, the girls didn't have to wait long before they did indeed find something hairy. Or more accurately, before something hairy found them.<br><br>Nora had been busy tugging at the collar of her tunic when all of a sudden a strong force threw her to the ground. Before she could so much as ask Annie what was going on, a shadow passed over her as something dark and the color of congealed blood came into view.<br><br>‚Ä∂Batwolves!‚Ä∂ Annie howled, raising her axe. ‚Ä∂Look out!‚Ä∂<br><br>Batwolves. So creatively named because they looked like some unholy combination of the two beasts, bearing a vaguely lupine face and a pair of leathery wings. Most days, they were relatively cautious towards humans, and in winter, they were completely inactive, sleeping away through the months of cold while the snow was high and the prey was low. However, come the spring, they would wake up desperately hungry and on the brink of starvation, making them unusually aggressive and extremely dangerous.<br><br>Annie leaped at the batwolf that had just tried to make a surprise swoop at Nora, swinging her axe with deadly force. Sounds of violence rang in the smaller girl's ears, but she knew better than to stay prone on the ground. Batwolves typically hunted in packs, which meant more would attack very soon. She knew this because she read about it. And because she saw two more coming at her.<br><br>Nora rolled to the side, just barely dodging the beast that came crashing down into the ground, snapping its jaws and thrashing its wing talons around violently. Raising her sword up in a defensive posture, she was able to deflect a blow from the other batwolf, delivering a slight cut to its rear leg which was enough to get it to howl in pain and redirect its flight away from her, but not send it to the ground. That was good. It meant for the next couple of seconds, she would only have to worry about the one in front of her.<br><br>Unfortunately, it didn't even give her one second, for the moment it got its bearings, it proceeded to leap at her. With lightning-quick reflexes she didn't know she had, Nora dodged to the side, feeling the breeze of its body pass by the side of her head. The batwolf would not be easily deterred, though; the instant it hit the ground, it made another mad leap for her. This time, Nora was able to duck under it, but not before it was able to deliver a scratch on her head with its hindclaw.<br><br>‚Ä∂Rrrhhhggg!‚Ä∂ she grunted painfully through clenched teeth. This was bad. At the rate she was going, she wouldn't be able to match the creature's speed. Sooner or later, it would strike her with a more lethal attack. That, or the other batwolf would move in for the kill. Nora needed to act fast, but what could she do? If only she could lighten her body in some way, make it more capable of evading the monsters. Or alternatively, if she could somehow slow it down.<br><br>She suddenly realized there was something she could do that would accomplish both tasks.<br><br>The batwolf snarled at Nora as it spun in a circle on the ground and leaped at her again so fluidly it could only be described as one motion. Its fangs were bared, its claws were retracted, and its aim was deadly, but Nora was ready this time. In a move that was just as fluid, she whipped off her coat and hurled it at the fiend!<br><br>The result was just as she hoped. The heavyset coat collided with the animal and sent it tumbling to the earth, a tangled mess of fur, wings, and claws. Underneath it, the beast thrashed with madness to escape, but Nora wasn't about to let that happen. Tightening the hold on her sword, she charged forward and sliced at the big writhing mass of hair. The coat was thick, designed to protect the body from ice and steel alike, but it was no match for the Lionheart Sword. The batwolf roared in pain and defiance, wounded but still full of fight. So Nora sliced at it again. And again. And again!<br><br>She was getting ready to thrust her sword into the pile to finish the heavily wounded but still living beast off when something tackled her to the side and knocked her down. On her back, Nora now found herself staring face to face with the other batwolf. It reared its head back, peeled back its lips to show off its razor-sharp teeth, and lunged!<br><br>‚Ä∂Get away from me, GETAWAYFROMME!‚Ä∂ Nora cried, panic coming over her. Still gripping her sword, she attempted to bash at the beast with its ruby pommel. She succeeded, and in doing so, she saved her life. For instead of ripping out her jugular as intended, the animal's charge stopped dead in its tracks and its head fell half-limply upon the girl's chest, with an unfocused gaze that was likely seeing little birdies. It recovered quickly enough though, and launched another attack on Nora, snapping its jaws shut and tearing into her skin!<br><br>Nora wasn't about to let that happen, though. With a swift kick of her legs and another swing of her arms, she whacked the batwolf in the face again with her sword's pommel and launched herself backward. She went one way, the animal went the other...<br><br>RRRRIIIIIIIIP!<br><br>..And the fabric of her tunic that the batwolf had managed to bite into went along with it, tearing the garment up from chest to groin.<br><br>Nora didn't have time to care about the sudden undressing. She had to act quickly while the monster was still dazed. Jumping to her feet, she charged at the batwolf, just in time for it to try and limply pounce on her again... only to find itself impaled by three feet of sharp, enchanted steel! It died instantly.<br><br>Another kill, she thought, breathing deeply as she stared at the dead animal hanging from her weapon. Another death at my hand. She had fought. She could fight. With this sword in hand, she could take on anything!<br><br>‚Ä∂Guh! AHHH! RRRRGGHHH!‚Ä∂<br><br>Sounds of battle rang in Nora's ears, and in that moment, she remembered the fight was not over yet. Annie was still engaged with the first batwolf, which was likely the alpha if the large size and impressive wingspan that dwarfed the amazon was anything to go by. Worse, it was being flanked by two smaller underlings, and it was taking everything Annie had to keep them at bay, but that wouldn't last forever. Nora needed to help her!<br><br>Annie swung her axe at the alpha batwolf, and the beast in turn jumped back, deftly avoiding the blade. From her side, one of its underlings made a leap for her, but she was able to avoid the attack with a reflexive sidestep. If she was facing any one of these monsters alone, it wouldn't have been any problem, but the blonde had to be extra careful fighting three at once. She couldn't be as aggressive as she would have liked, she couldn't take every opening she saw, she couldn't swing her axe as forcefully as she would've preferred. Every millisecond had to be spent paying attention to her surroundings and making sure she left no openings herself. And the monsters were not giving her an inch!<br><br>Something seized her ankle, yanked her foot into the air, thrashed it around. It was the third batwolf! It managed to get her while she was distracted. She had been careless. ‚Ä∂Damn!‚Ä∂ she grunted as she fell to the earth, gritting her teeth as her back collided with a particularly hard rock. No less than a second after she fell, the trio of batwolves were on her, their teeth bared in ways that looked like they were smiling in victory.<br><br>Is this‚Ä¶ going to be it for me?<br><br>‚Ä∂YAAAHHHHHH!‚Ä∂<br><br>In a flash, Nora was on the scene, screaming like a madwoman and swinging her sword like a berserker. She slashed once, cutting one batwolf in the neck. Its head went spinning off into the distance. She slashed again, cutting deeply into the wing of the alpha. The monster roared in pain and fell backwards. She attempted a third slice on the final present batwolf but it was ready for her, leaping over Annie pouncing with a screech upon the bespectacled girl. The bespectacled and‚Ä¶ topless girl?<br><br>Is that really Nora? Where is her tunic? What is‚Ä¶ forget it. Don't have time for that! I gotta act, I gotta act NOW!<br><br>She had an opening now and only seconds to spare. Grabbing her axe, the blonde leapt to her feet, and charged at the alpha, which was still reeling from its most recent injury. It didn't have much time to lick its wounds, for Annie was on it in two seconds, and in the third, her axe was buried in its skull.<br><br>‚Ä∂Got you, you son of a bat-bitch!‚Ä∂ she growled, twisting her lips into a vicious smile as the life faded from the beast's eyes. Hearing the sounds of violence to her right, she hastily pulled her weapon from out of the creature to end it, but as soon as she had her axe hefted in the air, they died down. Worriedly, she looked to her side, hoping that her friend was alright. Her fears were allayed when she saw Nora stand up, a bit shaken and winded, but otherwise fine, which was more than could be said about the batwolf lying dead and bloody at her feet. Her smile faltered, however, when she took in the girl's form.<br><br>‚Ä∂Nora, what happened to your clothes?‚Ä∂<br><br>It was just as Annie had seen in the heat of battle not even a minute ago. Nearly torn in two and no longer able to hang from her shoulders, what remained of Nora's tunic dangled limply over her hips like a crude skirt, held in place only by the belt around her waist. She was topless, nearly every inch of her pale skin glowing in the sunlight. Only the cloth band tied around her breasts preserved Nora's dignity, but even that was showing signs of heavy strain. Strain that was only giving way to further damage as the girl deeply swallowed her breaths, her very sizeable boobs squeezing ever more tightly against the fraying fabric.<br><br>‚Ä∂Nora, you really should slow down already,‚Ä∂ said Annie, ‚Ä∂you're going to‚Äî‚Ä∂<br><br>Friiiiiip!<br><br>One last tear, one last shorn seam, and the band split apart, falling to the ground like a shed leaf in autumn. Nora's breasts spilled out, large, round, and luscious, and they jiggled like pudding as they came to rest in their newly liberated place in life.<br><br>‚Ä∂Ah,‚Ä∂ said Nora, looking down at her newly-released bosom, ‚Ä∂much better.‚Ä∂<br><br>"

        content: "She looked up, into the aghast face of Annie, and the sword still in her hands. Slowly, she remembered the need to sheath it, in the scabbard clipped to her waist. She gave Annie a smile. ‚Ä∂I guess the legend's true.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Nora,‚Ä∂ said Annie, her eyes cast down at the ripped band lying at Nora's bare feet, the spread-out, dirty toes gripping the earth. ‚Ä∂What's got into you?‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora replied with a shrug, stepping over the ripped cloth. ‚Ä∂I dunno, that battle didn't scare me so much. I mean, it did a little, but I couldn't bring myself to run away like I always do.‚Ä∂<br><br>Her friend seemed utterly indifferent to her half-nudity. She stood with a relaxed back, apparently comfortable with the bitter wind blowing through the field, resting her hands on her waist with a small smile. ‚Ä∂Are you feeling okay, Nora?‚Ä∂ Annie asked.<br><br>Nora gave a small nod. ‚Ä∂Doesn't feel too bad, really,‚Ä∂ she said, standing next to her friend. ‚Ä∂I dunno, maybe I should find a new tunic when we get to Snowmore.‚Ä∂ She paused. ‚Ä∂Oh, and some boots too, I guess.‚Ä∂ She gave her friend a smile, and began her trek out of the field, past the fallen batwolves.<br><br>It took Annie a few seconds to remember herself and run after her. ‚Ä∂Don't you wanna borrow my coat?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Nah, I'll be fine,‚Ä∂ Nora shouted back, taking great strides along the path, taking in the vista of the surrounding valley. In less than an hour, the two would be home.<br><br>---<br><br>A shadow passed over the dead batwolves. A cloaked figure, walking through the bloodied field, taking in the carnage that had clearly befallen them. ‚Ä∂Well,‚Ä∂ he said to himself, with a voice like thick honey, ‚Ä∂all these dead batwolves, and not a single victim of their attack. Looks like chief Kethlon has trained his soldiers properly, at long last.‚Ä∂<br><br>His gaze turned to the tomb entrance, on the horizon.<br><br>‚Ä∂Or,‚Ä∂ he muttered, ‚Ä∂she finally found her champion.‚Ä∂<br><br>The figure turned, and took the path into the mountains.<br><br>---<br><br>Nora walked with a spring to her step, her breasts bouncing and bobbing as she descended the mountains. She'd never known a sensation like this. It reminded her of those precious minutes after bathing in the lake, where she'd have to dry herself before dressing properly. Back then, she was never too desperate to put them on, but she never realised how comfortable it was. Standing so free, so bare in the early morning chill.<br><br>Thinking about that called attention to her trousers. Those thick, constricting, sweat-dampened trousers. How they clung to her legs, binding the flow of blood from head to toe. She shook her head, trying to forget that sensation. All she could do was put it at the back of her mind, and carry on.<br><br>‚Ä∂Y'know,‚Ä∂ she said jovially, looking at Annie, ‚Ä∂I look like Rutger the blacksmith. Gods, with a forge that hot, his whole waist is tanned as crisp as fire.‚Ä∂ She chuckled. ‚Ä∂Course, he's got sandals on, unlike me.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I don't get it,‚Ä∂ replied Annie, her gaze returning to Nora's bouncing boobs. She was giving them a lot of attention, Nora realised. Every so often, she'd find a new way to bring them up again. It was a wonder she wasn't repeating herself yet. ‚Ä∂My brother's been in all sorts of battles, he's faced the Orc King on the steppe, battled dragons, and even the undead. But he never ripped his clothes up that bad.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂He lost an eye, though,‚Ä∂ replied Nora, looking at Annie, studying her gaze. ‚Ä∂I'd take this loss over my parts, any day.‚Ä∂ She looked down at her boobs again. Even she had to admit, they were pretty distracting. Is there any chance I could lose these in battle? ‚Ä∂Hell, he had to retire because of it.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well yeah, but‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ Annie muttered, clawing for a comeback. ‚Ä∂I-I'm still hung up on the boots issue. You can't deny, that's a pretty unorthodox strategy.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂You know what part I don't get?‚Ä∂ Nora asked, as Snowmore came into view. ‚Ä∂It was that statue in the door. That nude woman. Who was she?‚Ä∂ At the time, she figured she was Syvan. But that's ridiculous, she told herself after they'd left the tomb. A warrior as legendary as her would wear armour, wouldn't she?<br><br>‚Ä∂Maybe the stonemason hadn't spoken to girls before,‚Ä∂ Annie said thoughtlessly. ‚Ä∂I mean, it's a bit tasteless, carving a naked girl for the tomb of the greatest woman warrior in the land.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora shrugged and then smiled, a clear idea forming in her eyes. ‚Ä∂Well, what if that was her,‚Ä∂ she said. ‚Ä∂What if that nude girl was Syvan?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Seriously?‚Ä∂ Annie scoffed. ‚Ä∂I think that sword's going to your head, Nora.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Maybe it has,‚Ä∂ Nora replied, reaching the small bridge over the brook. ‚Ä∂That's what I wanted, remember.‚Ä∂ She crossed the brook, opened the gate, and set foot in Snowmore. It was early afternoon by now, and the villagers were going about their duties, same as normal. The smithy was in his forge, the baker carrying wheat into his hut, and the farmer ushering two cows through the square.<br><br>As she took it in, two children ran past her, stopping as they passed her by. ‚Ä∂Nora's back!‚Ä∂ Timothy cheered, hugging Nora's leg. She chuckled, stroking him on the head. He gasped, suddenly, and leapt back, realising, just now, what he was looking at. ‚Ä∂Nora, why are you naked?‚Ä∂<br><br>Considering he was only wearing leather dungarees without a shirt, and still wasn't wearing shoes yet, he was hardly one to talk. Nora smiled warmly at him, however, amused by his curiosity. ‚Ä∂I got into an adventure,‚Ä∂ she said, patting his messy blond hair, ‚Ä∂to find my bravery.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Hey, don't encourage him!‚Ä∂ Annie scolded, approaching the two. She looked down at Timothy. ‚Ä∂She just got unlucky, bro. Don't think that you're allowed to keep dressing up like that, just because the chief's daughter is.‚Ä∂<br><br>Timothy pouted. ‚Ä∂Spoilsport.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Nora?‚Ä∂ cried an older voice. Her father, Kethlon, stood by the watering hole, lifting two buckets in either arm. The sight of his daughter alive, topless and dishevelled but alive, made him forget he was holding them, and he ran over to her. The buckets fell and splashed water over the cobbles, spraying Timothy's feet. He giggled.<br><br>‚Ä∂Hey Dad,‚Ä∂ Nora managed, before her father wrapped his arms around her, covering her modesty for the village.<br><br>‚Ä∂Whatever happened up there?‚Ä∂ he said, staring at her in horror, taking note of the fresh scratch on her temple. ‚Ä∂Did you get hurt? I knew this was a terrible idea. Listen, I never should've let you-‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Dad's it's okay,‚Ä∂ Nora whispered. ‚Ä∂I got-‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Look at the state of you!‚Ä∂ Kethlon continued, barely noticing his daughter. ‚Ä∂Your feet are pink as a newborn baby, and your jugs- I mean, your, ah, your, your jugs! Whatever happened?!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Batwolves,‚Ä∂ Nora replied. ‚Ä∂Just a few small cuts and bruises.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Batwolves?!‚Ä∂ Kethlon repeated numbly. ‚Ä∂Gods, it's that time of year, isn't it? We left it too late! I should've let you go during‚Ä¶ winter‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ His gaze turned to the sword at her side. The horror in his eyes shifted towards awe. ‚Ä∂Wait, is that it?‚Ä∂ He pointed to the sword. ‚Ä∂You actually found it?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Yep!‚Ä∂ Nora nodded, removing it from the scabbard. There was a natural expertise to the way she held it. An instinct that guided her hand to keep the blade away from her father and young Timothy, while still brandishing it for all to see. ‚Ä∂Wasn't easy, but I got it.‚Ä∂ She sheathed it swiftly, in two graceful motions. ‚Ä∂And I think it works,‚Ä∂ she added. ‚Ä∂I feel amazing.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well, what happens if you remove it?‚Ä∂ asked Annie, looking at the ruby pommel. ‚Ä∂If this thing's giving you all this naked bravado, what happens if we took it away?‚Ä∂<br><br>The fiery glimmer in Nora's eyes sputtered. For a moment, Kethlon saw the same timid anxiety overtake her once again as she stepped away from her friend. ‚Ä∂I'd, uh, rather not know,‚Ä∂ she replied. ‚Ä∂Can we just, um, appreciate it for now? Like, let me have it for the rest of the day?‚Ä∂<br><br>Kethlon gave her a concerned look. ‚Ä∂Speak to Madame Saoirse,‚Ä∂ he demanded. ‚Ä∂We need to understand how this damned sword works on you.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Okay,‚Ä∂ said Nora reluctantly. All of a sudden, her naked chest and feet felt more vulnerable than they did on the way down, and not for the reasons she thought. Following her father to the soothsayer's hut, she wasn't worried they would get hurt, or infected or anything like that. Indeed, she felt surprisingly at ease with them both out in the open.<br><br>Please, she thought to herself, don't make me cover them up again. And that very thought startled her greatly. She ran ahead of her father, suddenly agreeing with him. She needed to understand this. What was the Lionheart Sword doing to her?<br><br>---<br><br>Once upon a time, Madame Saoirse had been a tall, muscular woman. A former amazon who had dedicated her glory days to prophecy and soothsaying. There was clearly an energy to her, granting her surprising speed for her age, and she still didn't need a walking stick. However, even she couldn't fully escape the ravages of age, for she had since grown small and wrinkled, and her eyes were turning milkier by the day.<br><br>Nora watched her as she stroked her chin, mumbling to herself. ‚Ä∂Well, of all the people to run about town without their shirt,‚Ä∂ she mused, ‚Ä∂you were the last person on my list.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Madame, please,‚Ä∂ Nora insisted, willing herself to take the sword from her belt, ‚Ä∂what's going on? I- I wanted this sword for a confidence boost, and it's‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂The Lionheart Sword, yes‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ She hobbled closer, getting a closer look at Nora's bulbous breasts. She gave them a flick, chuckling to herself at how they jiggled and invoking a gasp of outrage from Annie. Then, her spindly fingers prised the sword from Nora's hands, taking it from her. ‚Ä∂Well done for taking it, you. That is a true accomplishment.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora felt a part of herself ripped away as Madame Saoirse walked away with the sword. The vulnerability returned, and the sense of humiliation at how she was dressed. Yet, those thoughts weren't arranging themselves coherently. For every cry of ‚Ä∂Oh Gods, everyone can see my boobs!‚Ä∂, there was another thought going, ‚Ä∂Such freedom, such liberty! I never knew I could do all that!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂But what is it, Madame?‚Ä∂ Nora hissed tearfully, wrapping her arms around her breasts, taking a seat next to Annie. ‚Ä∂What does the sword have to do with me?‚Ä∂<br><br>Madame Saoirse held the sword in its scabbard, shifting it in the sunlight spilling from the roof. ‚Ä∂Fascinating,‚Ä∂ she rasped. ‚Ä∂The spirit of her blade belongs only to a single, courageous soul.‚Ä∂ Her gaze turned to Nora. ‚Ä∂You know of that, right?‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora nodded. ‚Ä∂That's the legend of Syvan, isn't it?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂That was her legacy,‚Ä∂ she replied, setting the sword aside. ‚Ä∂The elders never told you the truth of Syvan, did they?‚Ä∂ She laughed bitterly. ‚Ä∂No, they were simply too embarrassed to confront the truth. Her truth.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂They were pretty vague,‚Ä∂ Annie admitted, trying to keep her gaze on Madame Saoirse, with the odd peek at her friend. ‚Ä∂All they said was that she was a great woman warrior, how she died protecting Snowmore from the Frigid King, and, um, that whole spiel about the courageous soul.‚Ä∂<br><br>Madame Saoirse spat. ‚Ä∂She didn't die protecting Snowmore, dear girl.‚Ä∂ She marched towards Nora, and looked her in the eye. ‚Ä∂She established it. Yet the elders were too ashamed to acknowledge her legacy, so they hid the myth as best they could.‚Ä∂ She set the sword down on the ground behind her, out of Nora's sight. ‚Ä∂Course, those murals in her tomb paint a much clearer picture of who she was.‚Ä∂ She pulled up a stool, beckoning for Annie to join her. ‚Ä∂Allow me to tell you the true story,‚Ä∂ she whispered. ‚Ä∂Of Syvan Syllenis. The Warrior of Flesh.‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie shuffled closer to Nora, whose arms had settled onto her lap. Her breasts were fully on display again. Yet she was too enraptured in Saoirse's words to pay attention.<br><br>---<br><br>‚Ä∂A thousand years ago, when these mountains were untamed and untouched, there came a royal fleet seeking new lands. Leading the fleet was King Sullivan Syllenis, and his daughter, Syvan. He was a proud King, a wealthy monarch, whose land prided itself in civility and opulence. To him, the rest of the world was simply waiting to be taken and transformed into a pristine paradise.<br><br>‚Ä∂And yet, his daughter, Syvan, cared nothing for this. She cared nothing for regal dresses, royal balls, or formal ceremonies where even the poorest peasants had to give riches for their King. To her, it was just a front, with nothing of true worth beneath it. While her father made her wear binding corsets and heeled boots, she slept naked in her bedchambers, and ran barefoot through the streets at night. She knew joyous freedom, and valued that, above all.<br><br>‚Ä∂Now, as they entered this region, there broke out a mutiny among the crew. I forget the exact reason for this. Maybe the princess had bribed them to rebel against the King. Maybe he'd underpaid them for their services. Whatever happened, the King and his elite were defeated, overthrown, and exiled into the mountains. On that fateful night, he saw his daughter's face among the rebels. Princess Syvan Sylennis, wearing sodden rags and unkempt hair.<br><br>‚Ä∂The crew made landfall, and exiled Sullivan's elite into the mountains. Syvan went with them, talking to her father all the while. ‚ÄòThis is a new beginning for us,' she tried to tell him. ‚ÄòA chance to throw our riches aside, and live without greed.'<br><br>The king was incensed at his daughter's words. ‚ÄòThis land demands to be conquered,' he said. ‚ÄòNo child of mine is going to get in the way of that.'<br><br>Some time into their trek, a terrible blizzard blew in. So thick, so cold was the storm, the crew were forced to retreat, and leave the king and his elite entourage to the elements. Unfortunately, in the confusion, Sullivan took Syvan prisoner, and she could not escape with them. By the time they had returned to camp, they saw she was not with them. The blizzard continued to blow, well into the night, and she was feared dead.<br><br>‚Ä∂And yet, three days later, a figure walked down that mountain path, away from the still-raging blizzard. Syvan lived, and carried with her the scars of battle and the sword of her former kingdom. The unfrozen Syvan Sylennis, completely naked from head to toe.<br><br>‚Ä∂Over the years, while she would wear fur to keep warm, the Snowmorians witnessed her wear less and less. Baring her breasts as they battled batwolves. Showing her womanhood as they ate soup by the fire. And they fast forgot she ever wore boots to begin with. Something had changed in Syvan since that blizzard. As though a part of her had emerged, unimpeded by aristocratic standards and worthless weath.<br><br>‚Ä∂But her battle was yet to truly begin.<br><br>‚Ä∂One fateful day, an army marched towards Snowmore. A brigade from the mountains, with pearl necklaces and gold brooches frozen to their rotting bodies. Leading them was the former King Sullivan Sylennis, his crown decayed and rusted in the storm. The blizzard did many things to his entourage, but it did not send them to the void as it should have. Nobody will ever know what they experienced that fateful day or how they became so terribly twisted, and perhaps it is for the best.<br><br>‚Ä∂But Sullivan and his men had returned with only one goal. A crusade on the untamed lands of Snowmore. To unite every mountain, each crag, under the Sylennis banner.<br><br>‚Ä∂Who better than his daughter to oppose him?<br><br>‚Ä∂Syvan was far from the only person to fight back against Sullivan's forces. But none of the villagers battled so viciously, so rapidly, as she did. She had more to fight for than simply her life, or the lives of those she loved. No, in the years following the blizzard, her thoughts towards the Sylennis Kingdom, and all it stood for, had soured greatly. She had found a new lease of life in these wild lands, and it gave her purpose to defend it. She fought purely out of that joy.<br><br>‚Ä∂Unfortunately for her, the battle was not decided by her complete, crushing victory over her father. Rather, by his retreat deep into the mountains, with what few servicemen could still follow him. Perhaps she let him live. He was her father, after all. Yet, he still intended to punish her someday for, for betraying his kingdom and wrecking his conquest. She returned to the village. Syvan Sylennis, the Warrior of Flesh.<br><br>‚Ä∂Yet her victory was not appreciated by the elders. Long ashamed of her proud nudity, and blaming her for the King's return and the many deaths he left in his wake, they sent her into exile, promising only an honourable burial if she ever returned. Dishonoured and outraged, she made a simple vow to them. She would never fight for Snowmore again, but if they ever needed a saviour, only a warrior of her spirit could wield her sword in their defence. ‚ÄòThe spirit of my blade belongs only to a single, courageous soul.'<br><br>‚Ä∂So left Syvan Sylennis, the disgraced heroine.<br><br>‚Ä∂Her adventures did not stop there, as I'm sure you know. Unfortunately, in this foul trap of a village, her legacy is reduced to mere whispers of her, vague memories of her exploits. If you wish to see the truth beyond the murals of her tomb, to discover those who truly honoured her legacy, you must leave Snowmore, and seek the towns and villages beyond these gates.<br><br>‚Ä∂But that's not what you're here for, is it Nora?‚Ä∂<br><br>---<br><br>Nora chewed her lip nervously. Leave‚Ä¶ Snowmore? Oh, she'd be lying if she said she had no desire to venture outside the village. Everyone her age had that fantasy. And she did admit, learning more about Syvan was tempting; ever since she saw the stone murals of her conquests and exploits in the tomb, the girl found herself growing ever more fascinated with the lady warrior. But she had to be realistic; the world outside the village walls was dangerous and she wasn't ready to confront it just yet. Especially not without her sword.<br><br>Her sword. Nora had only been parted from it for a few minutes and already she was missing it terribly. She felt so naked without it in her hand or by her side, and that had nothing to do with how naked she literally was right now. Or maybe it did. Looking down, she remembered she was still very topless, her boobs bobbing up and down with her breaths in plain sight for all to see. And everyone had seen! How big and round they were, how they bounced and jiggled with her movements, how her rosy red nipples stood tall and erect in the chilly spring breeze.<br><br>Her arms were over her chest again in milliseconds.<br><br>Saoirse chuckled at the younger girl's antics. ‚Ä∂No, of course you're not. You did not come to a relic such as I to learn about the past, but to understand your present and with it, your future.‚Ä∂ She lifted the sword up again and ran her hand down the length of the blade, examining both the quality of the steel and the magic imbued within. ‚Ä∂Syvan Syllenis is long dead, but the spirit she fought with lives on in this blade, honed by hundreds of victorious battles and the blood of even more fallen enemies. To wield this blade is to give you that spirit and all that entails. Syvan's experience, her battle prowess, her courage, which you specifically sought. All of them are now yours, Nora. As is her aversion to armour and vestments.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂So you mean‚Ä¶ I'll become a Warrior of Flesh as well?‚Ä∂ said Nora. She didn't know what to think about that, didn't know if she actually wanted it. She was feeling both uncomfortably chilly and hot sitting half-naked in here, with the cold air raking uncomfortably on her bare skin while her embarrassment boiled her up from inside. She just wanted a confidence boost, something that would allow to look a threat in the face and charge! Not something that would turn her into some kind of‚Ä¶ fighting‚Ä¶ exhibitionist‚Ä¶ person thing! But if she had the sword in her possession‚Ä¶ would she really care?<br><br>‚Ä∂It is your choice if you wish to continue wielding it,‚Ä∂ said the soothsayer as she handed the sword back to Nora. ‚Ä∂Perhaps in time, you will learn to master it and become your own warrior. But do take care. The spirit in the Lionheart is strong, stronger than any enchantment I have ever seen in any weapon in all my years. If you are not careful, Nora, it may very well consume you, make you more sword than woman.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora licked her lips nervously as she eyed the Lionheart. Consume her? Make her more sword than woman? What did that even mean? Nora started to feel especially cold in her feet. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe this wasn't such a good idea.<br><br>‚Ä∂I have a bad feeling about this,‚Ä∂ said Annie, echoing her trepidation.<br><br>But as Nora started to curl herself up, she remembered how it felt to face down the golem. To cut it into pieces with but a single slice, to run atop its back and slay it with a thrust. She remembered fighting the batwolves as well, tearing them asunder as they threatened to devour both her and Annie alive. It was exhilarating and liberating to finally stand tall and fight rather than turn back, cower, and hope someone would come save her. She‚Ä¶ enjoyed that feeling, and would gladly do anything just to feel it again.<br><br>Well, she didn't have to decide on anything just yet. And until she did, she would prefer to actually have the weapon. Better to own the sword and have the choice to leave it than to want the sword after it's already been tossed.<br><br>‚Ä∂It'll be fine,‚Ä∂ said Nora as she reached forward to grasp the Lionheart's hilt. And just like that, the nervousness surrounding her nudity faded, as did the blush that had overtaken her every inch of exposed skin.<br><br>---<br><br>Kethlon's eyes bulged again as he watched Nora exit the hut in the same state she had entered it in: bare in the feet and in the chest, He caught himself quickly though, shifting his gaze off to the side and letting out a few grunts to make it look like he was clearing his throat and not gawking at his daughter's bare chest. He had clearly been hoping the soothsayer would do something to cover Nora's shame.<br><br>‚Ä∂So, um, hrm, what did she say?‚Ä∂ he said, crossing his arms in an attempt to look stoic and stern.<br><br>‚Ä∂A fair bit,‚Ä∂ said Nora nonchalantly. ‚Ä∂But the short of it is that this,‚Ä∂ she ran her hands down the length of her naked torso, ‚Ä∂is part of the Lionheart Sword's effect on me. Syvan hated clothes and chose to fight in her natural state, and now that I wield her sword and hold her spirit‚Ä¶ I very well could too.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂She also said the sword could possibly consume you,‚Ä∂ added Annie reproachfully. ‚Ä∂Don't forget that part.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well, yeah, that too,‚Ä∂ said Nora, scratching her head as she smiled awkwardly. ‚Ä∂I was‚Ä¶ I was going to get to that.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂And you still wish to keep it, even knowing all that?‚Ä∂ said the chief. ‚Ä∂It sounds, uh,‚Ä∂ his eyes strayed back to his daughter's generous bosoms, ‚Ä∂dangerous. Going into battle without armor, that is, and whatever other...magical effects it could have.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I‚Ä¶ I haven't decided yet,‚Ä∂ said Nora, though she honestly didn't feel so sure letting those words out of her mouth. Of course she was doubtful when Madam Saoirse took it from her, but now that it was back in her possession, she realized she didn't want to let go of it again.<br><br>‚Ä∂Well‚Ä¶ you two have had a long journey,‚Ä∂ said Kethlon. ‚Ä∂You should head for the bathhouse to get cleaned up. While you do that, I'll have a hot meal and a fresh change of clothes prepared for you both.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Ah, sounds lovely,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂Really would like to get the stink of batwolf blood off me.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora, on the other hand, wasn't feeling nearly as excited as her friend. ‚Ä∂Fresh‚Ä¶ clothes?‚Ä∂<br><br>---<br><br>Well, if there was one advantage to the idea of taking a bath, it was that Nora now had an excuse to remove the few rags that still clung to her body. She undid her belt, let the tattered remains of her tunic drop to the floor, and slipped her thumbs into her trousers. Now that she was paying attention to them again, she was reminded about how‚Ä¶ discomforting they felt. They seemed to claw at her waist, cling to her legs, even dig tightly into the cleft of her buttocks. More than anything else, they were so‚Ä¶ constraining. Nora didn't feel like she could run as fast, kick as hard, or leap as high as she should have been able to, not with how much the fabric kept getting in the way. Compared to her bare feet, with her toes always grasping the ground, probing at the cracks and grains of the earth, constantly testing what could be gripped and what could be slipped upon, her legs just felt so‚Ä¶ numb.<br><br>But that was over now. She could‚Ä¶ she could finally take them off. And that's what she did. She slid them down over her hips, exposing her bubbly rear end for all the world to see. Cool air poured over it, cascading down every slope of her rich creamy globes and lightly tickling the sensitive flesh in between them. It felt‚Ä¶ it felt good. Like a sensual pair of lips kissing her most delicate parts.<br><br>At least, that's what she imagined a sensual kiss on her most delicate parts would feel like. Sadly, Nora hadn't gotten a chance to experience that sort of thing just yet. Thinking about it, she couldn't help but sigh sadly.<br><br>Well, it's not like I've ever met anyone who ever made me feel that way. No one's ever made my heart flutter like that. The closest I could think of would probably be‚Ä¶<br><br>She resisted the urge to look in Annie's direction. It‚Ä¶ wouldn't be polite to stare at her while she stripped out of her clothes.<br><br>Nora continued to slide her pants down the length of her legs, exposing more and more of her flesh. Tannish brown fabric peeled back to expose skin that was almost as white as snow, dead soulless sheepskin gave way to vibrant human flesh. Muscles rippled and flexed with renewed vigor, as though they too were excited to be freed of their textile prisons, and blood pumped more eagerly through their veins in a way that seemed to warm them even in the cool air. Once she slipped the fabric to her knees, Nora released the garment and let it fall in a pile at her feet and cooed happily as she stepped out of it, naked as the day she was born.<br><br>‚Ä∂Mmm, this feels so nice.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well, I can't argue with that,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂It does feel good to get out of those old clothes.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora turned to face her friend and felt her heart drop as it always did whenever she saw so much of Annie's skin all at once. Her body was more evenly tanned from the greater amount of time she spent in the sunlight and raw muscle rippled across every inch of her Amazonian frame. Her biceps bulged impressively whenever she folded her limbs, her abdominals were so sharply defined that just looking at them could cut you, the contours in her back shifted and undulated with her movements as though they were made of liquid, and the only fatty parts of Annie that jiggled even slightly were her medium-sized boobs. Everything about her oozed feminine strength in the way that Nora most decidedly did not. It was enough to make her sigh again. Even with the Lionheart in her possession, she still felt like a pinky mouse in the presence of her friend.<br><br>Well of course you do, Nora! she thought, giving herself a mental slap. She's spent her whole life training, fighting, and turning her body into a weapon, while you spent yours hiding in a corner. But it doesn't have to be that way anymore. Soon, you'll be able to stand toe to toe and side by with her in a way no one else in the village could ever hope to achieve<br><br>She tightened her grip on the sword, still resting in its sheath on the bench.<br><br>‚Ä∂Put the sword away, Nora,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂You know the rules, and besides, you wouldn't want it to rust.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora wondered if that was actually true. The Lionheart was in pristine condition despite being a thousand years old. The blade looked to be polished to a mirror sheen, it was sharp enough to cut a golem made of stone as if it were made of butter, and it bore no chips or scratches at all on its surface. The bespectacled girl couldn't help but find it a bit laughable that a little water of all things would hurt it. But Annie was right; it would be bad manners to bring a weapon into the bath when they were expressly forbidden. After storing it on the available weapon rack, she followed Annie to the bathing pool, but even so, she couldn't help but glance back at her sword, already disliking the distance she was forced to put between it and her body.<br><br>Snowmore might have had the reputation of being a miserably cold and nigh inhospitable place, but that wasn't true, at least some of the time. While the winters could be harsh, and it did indeed snow more here than it did most anywhere else in the civilized world, the village was also home to a number of hot springs that stayed warm through even the iciest of blizzards. This made Snowmore an especially ideal place to build a bathhouse or two since nature had seen fit to provide all the hot water they would need.<br><br>Annie sighed happily as she lowered herself into the main pool, which was currently empty. ‚Ä∂Pheewww! Oh, that hits the spot.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora wished she could agree. The water did indeed feel good sliding up her naked body, seeping into her crevices and warming up her joints just like it always did. But she just‚Ä¶didn't feel right sitting in here like this, naked, vulnerable, and without her sword. Even under the warmed water, she could feel her hands tremble, like they were shivering in the cold, desperate to stroke the serpentine hilt of her Lionheart again.<br><br>Desperate to stroke the serpentine hilt of my Lionheart again? Nora paused for a moment to consider what she just thought, then burst into a fit of giggles as the words echoed in her mind. At least she still had her sense of humor.<br><br>‚Ä∂Oh, good, I was afraid I was going to have to force you to relax,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂You looked like you were ready to run screaming up the nearest column like a frightened squirrel.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well‚Ä¶ maybe I was,‚Ä∂ Nora murmured once her laughs finally died down.<br><br>‚Ä∂I have to admit, it is pretty funny seeing you be all bashful and nervous in your nudity after you just flashed the whole village not even an hour ago without even batting an eye,‚Ä∂ Annie chuckled, leaning back to further soak in the pool. She didn't soak in long before a thought crossed her mind, forcing her to sit back up again with a serious look on her face. ‚Ä∂But that doesn't change the fact that that sword is bad news.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora sighed for what had to be the zillionth time that day. Somehow, she just knew this conversation was going to come up. ‚Ä∂You're going to try and talk me out of keeping it.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Yes, I'm going to talk you out of keeping it. It's a magic sword, Nora, one that I don't think you're prepared for just yet. You've only had it for a few hours now, but it's already affecting your behavior.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂It‚Ä¶ is,‚Ä∂ said Nora, ‚Ä∂and it‚Ä¶it feels good. I mean, did you see me when I was fighting those batwolves?‚Ä∂ She started flailing her arms around like she was swinging a sword with them. ‚Ä∂I was all like fwoosh, whoosh, fwoosh, and they were all like ooh, aah, uhhhh! And when I faced that golem, I was like EEEYAAAAHHHH!‚Ä∂ At this she leaped straight out of the pool and onto the floor, splashing hot water everywhere, steam wafting off her shiny naked body. Annie had to raise her arms to keep her eyes from getting burned. ‚Ä∂I wish you had seen it!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I'm sure it was really something,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂I get a rush during a fight too, it's amazing, and I understand exactly how you feel. But the thing is‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Do you really understand me?‚Ä∂ said Nora as she returned to the water, her childish excitement gone. ‚Ä∂Do you understand what it's like‚Ä¶ to always feel so powerless? Do you understand what it's like to feel like you have no control over anything in your life and that you could die at any moment? Do you understand what it's like to see a troll look you in the eye and start licking its lips, knowing you would make an easy meal? Do you understand what it's like‚Ä¶ to feel like you're a worthless pile of manure who can only watch as someone's house burns down because you were too scared to run in and stop the marauder from hurling his torch into it?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Nora‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Is that what you want me to go back to being? Well, you may want that of me Annie, but I sure as hell don't! I'm SICK OF IT!‚Ä∂ The auburn-haired girl pounded the water with her fists, sending more of it flying up in the air. ‚Ä∂I've been of fighting age for several years now and yet I'm still as chickenhearted as a child! I just want‚Ä¶ I just wanted a quick draught of courage, just a little bit, so I could finally get over myself and become the person my village needs me to be!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Look, I understand,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂You're easily frightened and you're frustrated, I understand perfectly. I'm just saying the Lionheart Sword might not be the answer. Nora, there are people here who can teach you to fight, there are people here who can help you develop your courage bit by bit. But magic‚Ä¶ that's not something anyone here is prepared for. And if the sword makes you always naked, well‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Don't want to hear it!‚Ä∂ growled Nora as she clambered out of the spring, red in the face and on her butt. Her nude body glowed luxuriously as the water streamed down her form, flowing down the curves of her slender shoulders, her slightly widened hips, and in between the bulbous orbs of her buttocks as they quivered in the humid air. She didn't take any time to enjoy the feeling, though; she merely stormed off to the nearest bench to sulk.<br><br>Annie wouldn't be deterred, though. ‚Ä∂Nora! I'm just‚Äî‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I said I don't want to hear it!‚Ä∂ roared Nora, throwing herself down on the bench in a way that came across as more of a full-bodied stomp. The wet, slapping sound of her butt cheeks falling upon the wood rang with the force of a hammer on a skull all throughout the bathhouse. She expected to hear more protests from her friend, to hear her splash water around as she jumped out of the bath to get in Nora's face and tell her precisely how she should live her life.<br><br>She was only greeted by silence.<br><br>Nora winced, her temper extinguished just as quickly as it was set alight. She didn't‚Ä¶ she didn't want to be this way. She didn't want to fight with her friend. Annie was just trying to look out for her like she always did, she knew that. She didn't want something as silly as a sword to come between them.<br><br>A sword that's been changing me ever since I touched it.<br><br>‚Ä∂Annie, I'm‚Ä¶ I'm sorry,‚Ä∂ said Nora, spinning around on her bench to address her friend. ‚Ä∂I didn't mean it, I just‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>She saw nothing. Just an empty pool of lightly rippling water in a misty cloud of steam.<br><br>‚Ä∂Annie?‚Ä∂ said Nora, as she squinted her eyes, hoping that her vision wasn't playing tricks on her, particularly since she wasn't wearing her glasses right now. ‚Ä∂Annie? Hey, where did you go?‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora checked some of the other pools. She found nothing and no one in any of them. She poked her head into the communal sauna. It was similarly empty. ‚Ä∂Where could she have gone?‚Ä∂ she muttered. ‚Ä∂She didn't actually just up and leave, did she?‚Ä∂<br><br>With no other choice, Nora marched down the hall back to the dressing room where their clothes and weapons were stored. And indeed, Annie's clothes were still there, as was her axe. But there was one other thing that Nora noticed that she knew she hadn't seen before: a letter on the bench addressed to her.<br><br>‚Ä∂What the‚Äî?‚Ä∂ Nora hastily donned her glasses before picking up the message. ‚Ä∂To Nora of Snowmore. We have your friend. She is alive for now, but that will not last. If you ever want to see her again, come to Coldman's Pass. Come alone. Do not bring friends, do not bring soldiers. If you do, she will die. You have been warned.‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora felt a cold sweat fall upon her, even though she was still warm from her dip in the hot springs. Someone kidnapped Annie! But who? And for what reason? And why‚Ä¶would they want her of all people? Nora, the cowardly, chickenhearted failure of a daughter of the village chief? It didn't make sense, it didn't make sense at all‚Ä¶wait, there was more writing on the back of the letter. Perhaps it would provide more insight?<br><br>‚Ä∂We hav girl,‚Ä∂ Nora said, reading it aloud, noting that the writing was a lot cruder on this side and‚Ä¶ not very good. ‚Ä∂Go to Cold Man Pas. Yu cum alone. ALONE!‚Ä∂<br><br>The girl scowled. Her brow furrowed. Her hands clenched into fists, crumpling and tearing the paper into a ball. This was bad. This was very, very bad. Not only had some fiend gone and kidnapped her best friend right from under her nose, but whoever it was had the gall to assume she was some kind of barely illiterate barbarian! Oh, this son of an ogre was going to pay. He was going to pay very dearly!"

        title: "Chapter 4: The Frigid King",
        content: "When the blindfold was ripped away, Annie found herself staring into the icy horizon of Gehrman's Glaciers, their pale stone peaks bleeding into the clear sky. She blinked, and tried standing up, tried to get a better grasp of where she was and what had just happened. The last thing she remembered was seeing Nora sulking in the hot springs, like a child who had her favorite toy confiscated.<br><br>The next thing she felt were the ropes binding her wrists and ankles, and the thick, leathery fingers pinned to her head, keeping it still. ‚Ä∂Ah-ah-ah,‚Ä∂ hissed a deep voice, with a brittle snarl. Annie's eyes darted left and right, trying to get a look at her captor. All she could understand was where she had been taken. She could see the ancient stonework of the bridge they were on, and the land it connected to.<br><br>Annie had been taken to Coldman's Pass with nothing but ropes and a gag covering her body.<br><br>‚Ä∂Mmf! Mmmmmffff!‚Ä∂ she cried, struggling and writhing against the ropes. The winter air was bitingly cold, turning her skin a deep pink. The pain in her arms was beginning to numb, and she could already feel a loss of sensation in her toes. She wasn't built for this. People like her were not built to run naked in these lands.<br><br>‚Ä∂You need not worry,‚Ä∂ rasped her captor. ‚Ä∂She will come. We will settle this. I wish you had been taken under more dignified circumstances‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ The voice wheezed. She felt the grip on her head loosen just a little. She seized her chance and turned around. She was met with ice grey robes, leading to a withered face with piercing yellow irises, decked in rusted gold. Even the crown mounted to his head still held some splendour, despite its broken emeralds and twisted horns.<br><br>The Frigid King smiled at her. ‚Ä∂‚Ä¶When she sees how you suffer,‚Ä∂ he continued, ‚Ä∂it will surely give context for her folly. How puerile her champion truly is.‚Ä∂<br><br>He pulled his hand away. Annie struggled against the ropes, but found the knots bound far too tight. All she could do now was look around, feeling the cold eat away at her senses. Nora wasn't fazed by this, was she? she thought to herself. Maybe the sword chose her for a reason?<br><br>---<br><br>As remote as Snowmore was, there were still plenty of paths winding through the region, easily taking merchants from settlement to settlement. From there, Coldman's Pass was only two hours away on horseback. Few people dared to cross it though, especially those who knew about the Frigid King. As convenient a shortcut it was to the Spider Citadel, most people Kethlon knew insisted on taking the long way around.<br><br>Nora chose to run there on foot. The thought of taking a horse to the pass never crossed her mind. Even if it had, the reputation the sword had given her would surely scare anyone from giving her even a saddle to mount, let alone a full horse to ride. And so, tirelessly, Nora ran past Snowmore, straight towards the path leading up the hill. Through the thick grass, up the unstable rocks.<br><br>Annie was right, she thought to herself the whole time. This is my fault. This isn't courage the sword's given me. This is madness. A delusion from an insane warrior. In her rush, she barely paid any attention to what few clothes she had left in the changing rooms, neglecting even to take the scabbard with her. All she had on her was the sword, held firmly in her right hand.<br><br>‚Ä∂If I'd never gone to that stupid tomb,‚Ä∂ she cursed aloud, ‚Ä∂none of this would've ever happened!‚Ä∂<br><br>This was set to happen, regardless of your actions.<br><br>Nora froze. Did she think that? That idea didn't fit everything she'd told herself up to that point. It was just like the thoughts she'd had facing the golem and the batwolves. Thoughts guiding her muscles, instructing each swing of the sword. The thoughts that told her to cast off her shoes, and hate her sheepskin trousers.<br><br>‚Ä∂Syvan,‚Ä∂ said Nora aloud. ‚Ä∂Now is not the time.‚Ä∂ She shook her head, and continued her run.<br><br>Now is the only time we have, child. You misunderstand the purpose of my spirit.<br><br>‚Ä∂Oh, I understand perfectly!‚Ä∂ Nora snarled. ‚Ä∂You just wanted some naive coward to take your sword, just so you could drug her and take her clothes away. You pervert!‚Ä∂<br><br>I gave you nothing, Nora, that you did not already have.<br><br>‚Ä∂You liar!‚Ä∂ The path evened out, returning Nora to the plains she'd slain the batwolves in. She caught her breath for a moment. ‚Ä∂This is not normal. No sane woman goes into battle without protection! I bet everything in that tomb was just made up!‚Ä∂<br><br>I imbued the sword with my courage, in the hopes of passing it on to she who finds it. But I see your mind, and how clouded with hate it is.<br><br>Nora began her sprint across the plain, pointing the sword behind her as she ran. As that thought took hold, she slowed down to a jog as she began to process it. ‚Ä∂Hatred? For what?‚Ä∂<br><br>For yourself, child. For the part of you that did not want to enter combat. For the part of you that hated clothes. For the part of you that wasn't what your father hoped for. For the part of you that could never measure up to Annie.<br><br>With each statement, Nora slowed until once again, she stood at the end of the field, awaiting the next part of the Pass. At the top of the hill on the horizon was the bridge. Was Annie really there? She had to remind herself of that; what she had been told stole most of her attention.<br><br>‚Ä∂What are you talking about?‚Ä∂ she asked.<br><br>I never told you to throw off your shoes, whispered Syvan. It was never my word that caused your discomfort with your tunic. I only guided you in the battle, and imparted the thrill of the fight. The flesh was always you, Nora. I believe that is why you sought me.<br><br>Nora looked at the sword. Gazing into its blade, into her reflection, she thought she could see someone else's eyes. A pair of dark hazel retinas, with long, brown hair flowing behind her. ‚Ä∂No,‚Ä∂ she said slowly, ‚Ä∂I sought you out because I wanted courage.‚Ä∂<br><br>Yes. Courage to be the woman you truly are. Not a savage warrior who simply kills monsters, like I was. But a smart, quick-witted amazon, who is proud of her flesh.<br><br>Nora looked down at herself.  Despite the chilly winds, her skin was as fair and snowy as ever, with nary a goose bump in sight. Her bosom was nice and firm, her arms held the sword quite steadily, and even her vagina was kept fresh and shaven. For a moment, she remembered the relief she felt during her baths; at how long she always took to get dressed again before leaving.<br><br>‚Ä∂That was me‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ Nora gasped. ‚Ä∂Syvan didn't tell me to strip off‚Ä¶ I did‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>You are about to face the only opponent I could not conquer, said Syvan. There is nothing I can do for you here. My courage and bloodlust will not help you. All I can give you is my faith, in the next Warrior of Flesh. She who could do what I could not.<br><br>The hazel eyes disappeared. Nora's bright blue eyes returned. ‚Ä∂Okay,‚Ä∂ she said to herself. ‚Ä∂So it really is up to me to save her. To save Annie. To save the one‚Ä¶to save those I love.‚Ä∂<br><br>Be bold, Nora Bellgrave. Be who you truly are, not what you're told to be.<br><br>Syvan's thoughts faded from Nora's head. She was free to think for herself once more.<br><br>Her first thought was to run towards that hill as fast as she could.<br><br>---<br><br>Annie had learned to stop reacting. Every fidget, strain, and attempt to scream only stole what little energy she had left. She'd already lost sensation in her arms and legs, and wasn't sure if that was because of the ropes restricting her blood circulation, or just because it was that cold. Probably both. All she could do instead was stare towards the horizon, and listen.<br><br>The wind had grown silent. Besides the shifting of the Frigid King and his associates, the soundscape was utterly barren. Coldman's Pass sounded as dead and lifeless as it looked, especially now that it was being controlled by the frozen dead. Now I see how the pass got its name, she thought wryly to herself.<br><br>She heard something faint, and she perked up suddenly. A pitter-patter, a slapping of bare footsteps on cold, solid earth. Annie gasped. Just from that sound alone, she could tell who it was. She wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or horrified as Nora's auburn head came into view, along with the tip of the Lionheart Sword.<br><br>Nora was totally naked now, yet looked as fair and comfortable as ever. Could she feel the cold? Did it hurt her at all? She didn't look it, not one bit. She looked angry and fierce, like a being of living fire ready to scorch the frozen earth and melt away all the ice. She held the sword, her sword in both hands, facing Annie's captor with a subtle yet pronounced snarl. ‚Ä∂Let her go,‚Ä∂ she said. Her tone was quiet, and she had not set foot on the bridge, but Annie could hear it perfectly. No doubt so could he.<br><br>‚Ä∂The champion of Syvan,‚Ä∂ growled the King. ‚Ä∂My disgraceful daughter's pet.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Let her go,‚Ä∂ Nora said again, taking her first step on the bridge, her toes clenching furiously into it as if they were ready to break it apart. ‚Ä∂Your battle's with me, not her.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂That so?‚Ä∂ The Frigid King chuckled. ‚Ä∂Apologies for the letter, by the way. I made the terrible mistake of asking Chancellor Alberto to write it on my behalf.‚Ä∂ He pointed to a small, fat man, rotting skin melting over his pale robes. ‚Ä∂Luckily, I corrected it just before-‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Are you an honourable man, or what?‚Ä∂ Nora hissed, stepping closer to them. ‚Ä∂You get nothing from killing her!‚Ä∂<br><br>The Frigid King chuckled. He opened his hand, beckoning for one of his corpses to shamble forwards, placing the hilt of an obsidian sword in his palm. Slowly, his fingers wrapped around it, and the black blade slid close to Annie's throat. She gasped again, tears streaming from her eyes. Nora grit her teeth, tightening her grip on the Lionheart.<br><br>‚Ä∂Why does her life matter to you so?‚Ä∂ he asked. ‚Ä∂If she was just some commoner, you would not care whether she lived or died.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂How can you say that?!‚Ä∂ Nora screamed, losing her sense of composure. ‚Ä∂She matters to me, to her family! The whole village wants her to live and be happy! It's the same with everybody else!‚Ä∂ She dared not move, terrified that any more steps or the wrong word would end her friend's life then and there.<br><br>‚Ä∂You want us to fight on honourable terms, do you not?‚Ä∂ The blade tipped Annie's chest up a little, just so the two women could look at each other. Annie saw a surprising resolve in Nora's eyes. It wasn't the same fiery bloodlust that came with the sword. They looked panic-driven, crackling with tension. ‚Ä∂Allow me to kill her now, and you will get your wish.‚Ä∂<br><br>This is how he bested me, Syvan whispered to Nora. He provoked me in a blind rage, baiting me with footmen to slaughter while he got away with his un-life. Not even my blade could keep him down.<br><br>Nora shifted her gaze to the Frigid King's. All she could see in his sockets were two ink black orbs, with thin, yellow irises shining from them. She could sense a lust for power from them, a rush from her vulnerability. He had the cards stacked. If she did what she was expected to do, he would win.<br><br>She closed her eyes, relaxing the grip around the hilt. ‚Ä∂All right,‚Ä∂ she muttered, letting the sword return to her right hand. ‚Ä∂You got me. I care too much for her. You've called my bluff.‚Ä∂<br><br>The greedy glimmer in his eyes dimmed a little. ‚Ä∂So you submit?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂If you kill her, I'd be far too scared to even want to fight you,‚Ä∂ she told him. ‚Ä∂Hell, without this sword, I'm nothing but an oversized mouse pretending to be a woman.‚Ä∂ She dropped the sword to the ground, allowing the wave of anxiety to fill her mind. ‚Ä∂I don't stand a chance, really.‚Ä∂<br><br>The Frigid King laughed. Clearly he was disappointed to see Syvan's champion give up so easily, but he was quickly learning to enjoy it. ‚Ä∂Some champion you are!‚Ä∂ he roared, accompanied by the ear-piercing cackle of his minions. ‚Ä∂Your little band of savages need to be taught proper etiquette. And trust me, there is no better form of power than permanence. We will always be here, untouched by death!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂You'll have to get through me first,‚Ä∂ said Nora, sinking to her knees. ‚Ä∂That shouldn't be too hard for someone as immortal as you, should it?‚Ä∂<br><br>The King nodded. ‚Ä∂Get my steed,‚Ä∂ he whispered to a shambling minion in rags. As his minion disappeared, he sheathed his sword, stepping in front of Annie. Nora could see the ropes binding her slack just a little. She had an opportunity, if she just got the next part right. Step three, she told herself. You know what to do, Syvan.<br><br>‚Ä∂I am curious, though,‚Ä∂ said the King, as the steed trotted into view. Of all the corpses in his league, the horse was the most decayed, with not a single scrap of flesh left on it and a thin pinprick of red light in its eye sockets. ‚Ä∂Why do you care so much for this insignificant commoner?‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora sighed with exasperation. She'd got the King's guard down now. Whatever she said needed to keep him at ease. At the same time, though, Annie was listening to whatever she had to say. ‚Ä∂You heard me the first time,‚Ä∂ she replied. ‚Ä∂She's a commoner to you, but she's my commoner, from my village. And she's the strongest warrior the village has.‚Ä∂ She closed her eyes, looking away from Annie. ‚Ä∂Stronger than me, by a long shot.‚Ä∂<br><br>He grinned to himself, mounting the saddle. ‚Ä∂Then she will be the first to see you die!‚Ä∂ he declared, galloping towards her at full speed. He brandished his obsidian sword, while Nora's lay on the ground in front of her. He drew nearer and nearer, aiming for a single stroke to her neck. Within seconds, it would all be‚Äî<br><br>Now!<br><br>In a single motion, Nora grabbed the Lionheart Sword, swinging it in front of herself just as the Frigid King lunged towards her. The two blades locked and exploded off each other violently, thrown out of each other's hands. He and his horse reared back, startled by the force. She stayed firm, even as the force of the blast rippled all over her bare breasts. The King's blade fell into the abyss below, while Nora's spun to the opposite side. Quickly, she caught it, her fingers latching on to the weapon's airborne hilt so tightly that it could only be described as magnetic. Then, without a second to spare, she threw the sword across the bridge to Annie before she was even finished spinning on her feet.<br><br>The Lionheart Sword bounced across the bricks, spinning right next to Annie's side, the ruby pommel resting near her free hand. Immediately, she took it, slicing the ropes free and taking to her feet with the sword in both hands. Annie was free, liberated by the sword. At last, Nora could see her, and witnessed the sheer excitement and glee in her eyes. ‚Ä∂Nora,‚Ä∂ she cried, ‚Ä∂I'm-‚Ä∂<br><br>Get the King! Syvan screamed into her head. You don't have long!<br><br>Annie didn't have time to wonder who just said that. She could only do what it told her and what her instincts demanded. Without a second thought, the warrior raced towards the stunned King, too fast for any of his minions to stop her. Realizing the danger he was suddenly thrust in, the undead monarch looked around frantically for an escape route, unarmed and imprisoned by the very horse he was mounted to. ‚Ä∂Go, go!‚Ä∂ he commanded, tugging on the reins. The skeletal steed reared, ready to gallop past Nora and in the direction of the village while he still could.<br><br>Thinking fast, Annie threw the sword through the air towards Nora. It spun through the wind, landing gracefully in her hand. Then, spinning on her heel, Nora aimed and tossed the blade again, this time at the retreating Frigid King. It pierced the monarch's chest, and he fell limp off the saddle onto the bridge, inches away from the land. The horse continued to gallop, unaffected by the sudden loss of its master, before abruptly crumbling into a pile of old bones.<br><br>Nora and Annie stared at the Frigid King. His eyes gazed past them with fear, towards something they could not see. ‚Ä∂M-my child,‚Ä∂ he gasped, ‚Ä∂pl-please understand!‚Ä∂<br><br>A pale apparition appeared before the two girls. A muscular woman, scowling at her father without a shred of clothing on her. The image was too vague to see any distinct details, but the open nudity was clear for all to see. She glared at her father with nothing but contempt, resting her beefy, rippling arms on her bare waist. ‚Ä∂I always understood,‚Ä∂ she replied. ‚Ä∂That's why I had to do this.‚Ä∂<br><br>The light left the Frigid King's eyes, and his body slowly turned into sleet, melting on the bridge. The sword clattered onto the ground, wet, but unharmed. On the other side, a hundred horrified screams rang all throughout the pass as the shambling men of the Frigid King melted similarly, leaving nothing but soggy parchments and rusted jewelry in their wake. Slowly, their agonizing cries echoed into nothingness, and silence returned.<br><br>Nora turned back to the apparition of Syvan. But there was nothing there. The ghost had vanished along with the King's men. All she could hear were two words in her head. ‚Ä∂Thank you‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ Then, it was just her, Annie, and the sword.<br><br>‚Ä∂Was that...?‚Ä∂ Annie asked.<br><br>Nora nodded. ‚Ä∂Guess those legends were pretty accurate.‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie laughed, then suddenly wrapped herself around Nora. Before she knew what was going on, she felt Annie's cold arms tightening around her waist, and heard her sobbing with relief. A great rush filled her body, crushing the anxiety into powder. ‚Ä∂I'm sorry,‚Ä∂ she stammered, forcing out the words. ‚Ä∂I'm so s-sorry.‚Ä∂ It was a rush she had never experienced before, not even with the sword. Nora couldn't think of another time she felt this happy, this complete, being held so close to her best friend. She could feel Annie's naked skin pressed tightly against her own in a way that felt more intimate than any embrace they had shared in the past. Their breasts were interlocked, their nipples, hardened in the cold, were prodding into one another, and their hearts were beating harmoniously together like two drummers playing in unison.<br><br>Annie and Nora were close, closer than they had ever been in their entire lives, with absolutely nothing standing between them, not even a shred of cloth. For reasons she could not fathom, the smaller girl felt a surge of excitement well up deep inside her chest. Excitement and something‚Ä¶even warmer.<br><br>With her tears shed, Annie stepped back, nearly tripping over the sword, and awkwardly wiped her eyes as she tried to recover herself, embarrassed by her sudden outburst. ‚Ä∂I don't get it,‚Ä∂ she said, still trying to steady her voice. ‚Ä∂I only held that sword for a second, and now I don't feel so cold.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂It'll pass,‚Ä∂ Nora said with a shrug. ‚Ä∂Now c'mon, let's go find you some clothes.‚Ä∂ She picked up the sword, eager to feel its fiery warmth again before the cold assaulted her exposed skin and turned her into an ice sculpture. It was still there, as refreshing as ever, but it was no longer pouring into her as it had been previously. The Lionheart Sword's power was now locked firmly in the blade. My spirit will be there when you need it, Syvan whispered to her. But that time is not now.<br><br>She offered her hand to Annie, who took it gladly. ‚Ä∂Easy for you to say,‚Ä∂ Annie replied.<br><br>Nora chuckled loudly, returning to the familiar texture of cold, dry land. Behind them, the puddles of the Frigid King's men solidified into thin, crackling sheets of ice, encasing their jewels and clothes.<br><br>---<br><br>The two girls wasted no time in putting Coldman's Pass, its cursed history, and especially its chilled air behind them. They walked together, nearly hand in hand, clutching the hilt of the Lionheart Sword between them to share in both its warmth as well as in the warmth of their close proximity. It was the best and really only way to keep the blond amazon from succumbing to the cold without any clothes on to protect her.<br><br>Thankfully, the wintry air of the pass soon gave way to the still chilly but more bearable springtime temperature of the valley. There, the girls hoped to find the ruined remains of Nora's mammoth coat so that Annie could at least return home with some dignity intact. Unfortunately, as they tread closer, they realized that would not be so easy.<br><br>‚Ä∂Seems the smell of death attracted another pack of batwolves,‚Ä∂ said Annie, squinting at the mass of bestial things huddling together in the distance, feasting on the corpses of their own kind.<br><br>‚Ä∂I‚Ä¶ think I can take them,‚Ä∂ said Nora. She had just slain a thousand-year-old undead king that not even the Warrior of Flesh could defeat in her life. Compared to that, a few starving animals didn't seem like they would pose any threat.<br><br>‚Ä∂You can. I'm sure of it,‚Ä∂ said Annie, ‚Ä∂but I'd rather not risk it unarmed and in my‚Ä¶ current state.‚Ä∂ She looked down at her body, still bare and beholden to the world. ‚Ä∂And besides, we need to get back to Snowmore fast. Everyone's probably wondering where we both went.‚Ä∂<br><br>As if on cue, a thundering of hooves rang in the air as a number of horsemen rode in on the scene, with none other than Kethlon at their head.<br><br>‚Ä∂There they are! Company halt!‚Ä∂ he ordered, bringing his horse to a stop before leaping off it and embracing the two girls in an ursine hug. ‚Ä∂By the Gods, where have you two been? You didn't come for your meal, witnesses claimed they saw you running out of the village like a woman in a mad panic! I...‚Ä∂ He paused when he suddenly realized something was off about how the girls looked. And felt. ‚Ä∂You're naked! Both of you! What the‚Ä¶ how did‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>He backed off awkwardly, brushing his hands on his chest as if he was trying to wipe something dirty off them while the rest of his company laughed uproariously. His face could have served as a mirror reflection of Annie's (if she has grown a beard of course) with how red and flustered it was, for the blonde blushed furiously once it dawned on her that she was now exposed to Snowmore's sharpest eyes.<br><br>‚Ä∂AHH!‚Ä∂ she cried, throwing her arms over her body in a desperate attempt to cover her nudity. The act only caused the trackers to laugh even more boisterously. Even Nora couldn't resist herself. To think that Annie, the strongest woman she had ever known, who fought countless bandits, slaughtered innumerable beasts, slew several monsters, and looked the Frigid King in the face without blinking, would be reduced to a screaming little girl just by a little nudity. It just didn't fit the courageous warrior at all!<br><br>As for Nora herself, she couldn't really care about her own nudity. She was naked, in her natural state, the way she was when she first came into this world. And she‚Ä¶ was okay with that. She was okay with all these burly men looking at her, seeing her for the mature woman she truly was. She was okay with them leering at her large, firm breasts, tracing her supple curves with their eyes, and seeing how smooth her lower womanly lips really were with how she let nary a hair grow on them. She was fine with all of that. Because it showed how confident she was now, how brave she could really be, and what kind of warrior she was capable of becoming. A warrior the likes of which hadn't been seen in this world for over 1000 years. A Warrior of‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Ä∂Take this,‚Ä∂ said Kethlon, offering his bear pelt cloak to the nude girl, ‚Ä∂Before you freeze to death.‚Ä∂<br><br>Now it was Nora's turn to feel uncomfortable. She eyed the cloak hovering mere inches before her frame, at the huge, heavy, hairy thing that threatened to crush her shoulders. To constrain her breasts. To rob her skin of the sun and its life-giving energy. ‚Ä∂No,‚Ä∂ she said, shaking her head and stepping back, her old familiar nervousness creeping into her voice. ‚Ä∂No, don't‚Ä¶ don't put that on me! I don't want it, I don't want it‚Ä¶ anywhere on me! Please, don't make me put it on!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂What?‚Ä∂ said her father.<br><br>‚Ä∂She said she doesn't want to put it on!‚Ä∂ growled Annie, who took that moment to seize the garment out of the chieftain's hands. ‚Ä∂But I do, so gimme that!‚Ä∂<br><br>No words were said as she hastily wrapped the cloak around herself, which extended to her thighs and was enough to cover her private bits. However, it didn't solve the little issue that was her bare feet, which became evident when she shifted her weight on them and winced as she stepped on a pile of particularly sharp rocks. After giving Kethlon's party a quick assessment, she marched up to the horse owned by Kaia, the sole woman in the group.<br><br>‚Ä∂Willing to take a passenger?‚Ä∂ Annie asked, climbing atop the stirrup without waiting for the rider to answer. ‚Ä∂I don't want to get back to Snowmore on bloody stumps.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Uh‚Ä¶ sure,‚Ä∂ said Kaia as the blonde took a seat behind her, scooting forward slightly to make room for her in the saddle.<br><br>‚Ä∂Well then,‚Ä∂ said Kethlon as he turned his attention back to his daughter, ‚Ä∂shall I take you on my horse then?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll be fine going on foot,‚Ä∂ said Nora as she walked past him, looking eager to just pick up the pace already.<br><br>‚Ä∂But, but, Nora, you're...‚Ä∂ he sputtered, looking at her feet which were just as bare as the rest of her form.<br><br>‚Ä∂I'll be fine, Dad.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂She'll be fine,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂She ran all the way to Coldman's Pass by herself like that. She doesn't need a horse to get where she needs to be. Or boots. Or anything for that matter.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Coldman's Pass?‚Ä∂ said Kaia.<br><br>‚Ä∂Yep, Coldman's Pass,‚Ä∂ replied Annie.<br><br>‚Ä∂Coldman's Pass?‚Ä∂ said another rider.<br><br>‚Ä∂The very same,‚Ä∂ replied Nora.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Coldman's Pass?‚Ä∂ said Kethlon, his tone stunned. ‚Ä∂What on Earth were you doing in Coldman's Pass?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂It's a long story,‚Ä∂ said Nora. ‚Ä∂One that I'll be more than happy to tell you about later, possibly even on the way. But right now, we should just focus on getting away from those batwolves up ahead, getting home, and maybe getting Annie into some real clothes.‚Ä∂<br><br>She was already well past the riders when she finished talking, marching gracefully down the path, sashaying her butt every step of the way. All eyes present followed its movements, stunned to see the village mouse walking around so brazenly without a stitch of clothing on like it was the most natural thing in the world. They were all too stunned to even speak.<br><br>‚Ä∂Ahem, hrm, rrgghhfff,‚Ä∂ mumbled the village chief, somewhat annoyed at how everyone was gawking at his daughter's posterior. ‚Ä∂Enough of that already. Company march!‚Ä∂<br><br>The horsemen rode at an even pace around Nora, supposedly to form a protective ring around her, but she suspected‚Äîalong with her father and her friend if their dirty looks at the company were anything to go by‚Äîthey also wanted to look at her naked body. Unlike Kethlon and Annie though, she didn't care. It was just a body. Everyone had one, and while maybe hers wasn't the best around, she had every intention to change that. She might be thin and scrawny now, but as long as she held this sword, she too would be able to turn herself into a living breathing weapon that would be the envy of all women. Just like Syvan.<br><br>And just like Annie, she silently added, for some reason smiling at the thought that she could finally stand side by side with her best friend and Snowmore's greatest champion.<br><br>‚Ä∂So tell us this story already,‚Ä∂ said Rutger, a great bear of a man with a fiery red beard spilling down his chest. ‚Ä∂What drove the both of you to trek to the forbidden pass in only your mother's skins?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well, you see, it started while we were in the bath,‚Ä∂ said Nora. And so she told them. She told them how Annie had vanished without a trace, how she found the mysterious letter in the changing rooms, and how she had no choice but to bolt out of the village, bringing only her sword and nothing else. Annie interjected with her side of the tale, how she came to in the clutches of the legendary Frigid King. Together they described their meeting with the horror and his undead legion, and how through their cooperation and the guidance of the Warrior of Flesh herself, they were able to fell him and put an end to his reign of terror.<br><br>As she described the fight, Nora couldn't help but close her eyes as the vision of Annie holding the Lionheart Sword played out in her head. She always admired the blonde's figure and believed she was the most beautiful person in the world, more lovely than even the most highborn of princesses that graced the pages of her books. But when she saw Annie back there on the bridge, standing tall, her muscles tensed, her nipples erect, bearing nothing but the sword in her hands, she swore she could feel her heart soar. Ready to fight in her natural, raw, amazonian state, the blonde looked more amazing than ever! Like a statue come to life. Like she could be a Warrior of Flesh herself!<br><br>But that is not Annie's purpose. That is mine, Nora Bellgrave. I'm Syvan's chosen. I'm Syvan's champion. I'm Syvan's‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Ä∂So, you say you slew the Frigid King?‚Ä∂ said Kethlon contemplatively as Nora and Annie finished their story.<br><br>‚Ä∂Quite a tall tale if I do say so myself,‚Ä∂ said Rutger.<br><br>‚Ä∂Look, I know it's hard to believe,‚Ä∂ said Nora. ‚Ä∂But it's the truth! If you go back there, you'll find the remains of his undead army!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂I'm not saying I don't believe you,‚Ä∂ said Kethlon. ‚Ä∂I'm just thinking‚Ä¶ Coldman's Pass has always been a foreboding place. There was always‚Ä¶ something amiss about it. Not just because it remained frozen in ice all year round, but because every time you set foot in there, it would always feel like you were being watched, and judged. No, not judged. Hunted. But if the Frigid King is truly well and truly dead as you say he is‚Ä¶ well, we'll need to conduct an investigation on the pass in the near future. To see if its aura is‚Ä¶ still there. But that is something we'll worry about for another time.‚Ä∂<br><br>He sighed as he looked at his daughter. His dear, easily-frightened daughter. Completely nude, exposed to the elements, small, vulnerable. And yet, she didn't look vulnerable or frightened at all. She was positively calm and serene for once, emotions she rarely displayed this far away from the village. Even walking on the earth didn't seem to bother her as she rolled her bare feet upon it, her soles and her toes appearing to mold themselves against the often sharp and craggy rocks that dotted the earth's surface. Was this truly the girl he had raised?<br><br>‚Ä∂So I take you will be keeping the sword then?‚Ä∂ Kethlon asked, his voice oddly melancholy.<br><br>Nora nodded. ‚Ä∂Yes, father, I will. Without it, I couldn't have ever rescued Annie, and if I refuse it, I‚Ä¶ I fear I will be doing something terribly irresponsible. Like I would be refusing a gift that was given to me.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Even knowing what it could do to you? What it is, um‚Ä¶ doing to you right now?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂It doesn't matter,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂We all put our lives on the line when we go into battle. We all endanger ourselves when we fight. Whatever danger the sword poses toward Nora is no different. It's a threat she'll have to face down herself, and an enemy she'll have to defeat. And if she wants to be courageous and not cowardly, then that's her only option.‚Ä∂ At this, the blonde turned to give the naked girl a meaningful look. ‚Ä∂Right, Nora?‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora blushed as her friend stared at her, her eyes telling her in no uncertain terms that despite her previous misgivings, she would always support her friend, would always be there for her, side by side with her Nora, the Warrior of Flesh. ‚Ä∂Annie,‚Ä∂ she whispered, nearly moved to tears.<br><br>‚Ä∂If‚Ä¶ that is what you wish,‚Ä∂ said Kethlon, his tone still unsure.<br><br>‚Ä∂It is,‚Ä∂ said Nora.<br><br>‚Ä∂Hey, no complaints from me!‚Ä∂ said Rutger.<br><br>‚Ä∂Nor me!‚Ä∂ said another man, and nearly everyone burst into another round of laughter.<br><br>The conversation petered out as the company arrived back in Snowmore. Nora hadn't made it two steps into the gate before she was suddenly tackled by a very familiar child. ‚Ä∂Nora! You're back,‚Ä∂ cried Timothy as he embraced her leg for the second time that day. ‚Ä∂You're okay! And you're‚Ä¶‚Ä∂ his voice trailed off as he looked up and down the girl and took in her completely bare form. ‚Ä∂Nakeder!‚Ä∂<br><br>She saw his eyes were red and misty, no doubt from crying. She wasn't surprised; he was very fond of her and no doubt had been worried sick about her. ‚Ä∂I'm sorry,‚Ä∂ she said, stroking his head affectionately. ‚Ä∂I'm sorry for making you so worried.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂You better be!‚Ä∂ the boy howled. He then turned to point at his friend, Astrid, who was standing right behind him, a not-so-innocent smile on her face. ‚Ä∂Astrid said that you and Annie eloped! And right after I swore that I was gonna be the one to marry you! But you didn't, did you? Tell me you didn't marry Annie!‚Ä∂<br><br>Another great laugh erupted from everyone present. From the blond child standing behind the boy. From the horsemen riding behind Nora. Even Kethlon couldn't suppress a chortle of his own. Only the naked girl stood silent as she stared at the boy with a look of absolutely dumbfounded shock. ‚Ä∂What?‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie was already off Kaia's horse. ‚Ä∂Ha, you don't need to worry about that, Timothy! No one here is getting married today. Nora's still available!‚Ä∂<br><br>That seemed to cheer Timothy up. ‚Ä∂Yayyyyy! Does this mean I get to be naked too?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Absolutely not!‚Ä∂ said the boy's father, who had been among Kethlon's group. Though the fact that his eyes kept on straying to Nora's heart-shaped rump didn't escape anyone's notice.<br><br>‚Ä∂Nuts.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Well then,‚Ä∂ said Annie, ‚Ä∂I am going to go take another hot bath. And then I'm going to get dressed. For real this time. And when I get out, I expect to have my long overdue lunch on top of my hot supper. And YOU,‚Ä∂ she added, grabbing Nora's shoulder, ‚Ä∂are coming with me.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Huh, wh-why?‚Ä∂ stammered the naked girl, who was still reeling from Timothy's out-of-the-blue statement.<br><br>‚Ä∂You just hiked from Coldman's Pass and back and fought a 1000-year-old lich. Even Warriors of Flesh need to bathe after that much action.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Um‚Ä¶ I guess,‚Ä∂ Nora murmured. She was about to add that King Syllenis was technically not a lich on account of him not appearing to hold his soul in a phylactery, but she found she was having trouble getting her tongue out of the knot it was tied up in.<br><br>At least the bath felt nice when she plunked her nude body into it. That was good, especially since she had to cut her last one short. And it gave her a chance to look at Annie's nude body again, which was oddly calming. It's kind of a shame she's not the Warrior of Flesh, she thought. I wouldn't mind getting to see Annie naked all the time.<br><br>‚Ä∂Hey, if I didn't already, I just want to say thanks again,‚Ä∂ said Annie as she sat across from her friend. ‚Ä∂For‚Ä¶ saving my life and all.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Oh‚Ä¶ you're‚Ä¶ you're welcome,‚Ä∂ said Nora nervously, a blush starting to creep up her face. She never heard anyone say that specific set of words to her. She never thought anyone would ever say those words to her. But now that someone was‚Ä¶ she didn't quite know what to make of it.<br><br>‚Ä∂No really, I've been in a lot of scrapes before, and I've had plenty of close calls, but when I found myself face to face with the Frigid King, that was really the first time I ever truly felt helpless and‚Ä¶ and scared,‚Ä∂ said Annie, her own cheeks turning red. ‚Ä∂I thought for sure that was the moment I was going to die.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂He didn't hurt you, did he?‚Ä∂ said Nora, wading closer to take a better look at her friend to make sure she wasn't sporting any new scars.<br><br>‚Ä∂No, just frosted me in the wind for a bit. Nothing I won't recover from, thanks to you‚Ä¶ and Syvan.‚Ä∂ Her smile faltered as a guilty look came over her. ‚Ä∂Look, Nora, I'm really sorry for doubting you and the sword. I thought it was having some kind of corrupting influence on you and that worried me, but‚Ä¶ the second I held it in my hand, I‚Ä¶ ‚Ä∂<br><br>She trailed off, her words hanging in the air in the same way her jaw hung open, as if the winds of Coldman's Pass finally caught up and froze her for real.<br><br>‚Ä∂Did it feel‚Ä¶ good to hold it?‚Ä∂ said Nora.<br><br>‚Ä∂It‚Ä¶ did,‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂I don't know if I got the same surge of courage as you did. But I think I got an inkling on why you became so attached to the sword. And I got the impression that perhaps the spirit in it‚Ä¶ can be trusted. At least‚Ä¶to some degree.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Would you ever like to hold it again?‚Ä∂ said Nora. For some reason, she couldn't help but wetten her lips at the mere thought of her friend willfully picking up the Lionheart and accepting all that naturally came with it.<br><br>‚Ä∂No, it's not for me. It's yours. It chose you. Syvan chose you. And besides, you might be okay with running around naked, but that's not my way.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Oh.‚Ä∂ Nora couldn't help but feel disappointed by that answer. While sharing the Lionheart Sword would indeed be‚Ä¶ difficult, she couldn't help but get the idea of her friend fighting in the nude out of her head. She had only been doing it for a day now and already she loved it. If only Annie could see amazing it truly was, to free yourself of the vestments that only weighed you down.<br><br>If only we could fight together, side by side, the two nude warrior women of Snowmore! We'd be unstoppable! Both of us‚Ä¶ together‚Ä¶<br><br>Just thinking about it brought Nora back to the recent conversation concerning marriage, how little Timothy, bless his heart, thought she and Anne actually eloped! It was‚Ä¶ kind of silly for him to think that‚Ä¶ and kind of cute‚Ä¶ but now, it was really starting to make Nora think.<br><br>‚Ä∂Hey, um, Annie, about what was said back there? By Timothy and Astrid?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Hm? What about them?‚Ä∂ said Annie.<br><br>‚Ä∂Uh, well‚Ä¶about what was said‚Ä¶about marriage. Is there someone that you're...I mean...have you ever thought‚Ä¶no, I meant‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>Annie quirked an eyebrow. ‚Ä∂Uh, Nora, are you feeling okay?‚Ä∂<br><br>Damn it, what the hell was wrong with Nora? Why was she having so much trouble asking her friend a simple question? She had faced far more dangerous things all day, things that could kill her. So why‚Ä¶ was just talking to her best friend making her freeze up like a frightened little mouse again?<br><br>It's because I don't have the sword is why I'm so nervous, thought Nora. If I just had it, if I just had Syvan by my side, then maybe I could‚Ä¶<br><br>That was it!<br><br>Nora rose out of the pool again, splashing water around excitedly for the second time that day, her naked body glistening beautifully in the dim light. ‚Ä∂Come with me!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Come with you?‚Ä∂ said Annie. ‚Ä∂Where?‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂To the changing room!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Uh‚Ä¶ okay?‚Ä∂<br><br>The two nude girls returned to the changing room. Their clothes were exactly where they left them, but as was becoming customary for Nora, they didn't really matter. The only thing that concerned her was the sword.<br><br>‚Ä∂Yes, it's an amazing sword, Nora,‚Ä∂ said Annie when she saw her naked friend lift it off the rack and hold it before her, like she was a kid showing off her newest toy. ‚Ä∂I've had firsthand experience with it.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂No, that's not what this is about,‚Ä∂ said Nora, biting her lip nervously. ‚Ä∂There's just‚Ä¶ there's something I‚Ä¶ need to ask you, and I‚Ä¶‚Ä∂<br><br>I don't have the courage to say it by myself.<br><br>‚Ä∂Well, what is it?‚Ä∂<br><br>Nora tightened her hold on the sword, took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and concentrated. She felt the spirit of the sword flow through her fingers, coil around her arm, and wrap itself around her heart. A surge of warmth overtook her, the feeling of a refreshing breeze blew her hair, an invisible finger seemed to playfully flick her nipples.<br><br>And then, there was nothing.<br><br>Syvan? she thought. Syvan are you there? I‚Ä¶ could really use some of your courage right now.<br><br>She couldn't see the Warrior of Flesh, but she swore the warrior was shaking her head at her right about now. You have all the courage I can give you, Nora Bellgrave. You have the courage to face any enemy you encounter and fight any battle you engage in. But this is not a challenge my spirit can help you with.<br><br>Nora frowned. You can't help me here? Then what am I supposed to do?<br><br>You will have to find it yourself.<br><br>But‚Ä¶ how am I supposed to do that? I've never been able to find courage by myself! Ever! Which is why I came to you!<br><br>She was met with silence. Syvan spoke no more.<br><br>‚Ä∂Are you done?‚Ä∂ said Annie, who decided now was the time to finally put on her clothes. ‚Ä∂I sure hope you don't get this tongue-tied for tonight's supper. Because everyone is going to want to hear about our adventure tonight.‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂They‚Ä¶ will?‚Ä∂ said Nora, blankly, like she had no idea what the words she was enunciating even meant. ‚Ä∂Er, I mean, yes, they will!‚Ä∂<br><br>‚Ä∂Good,‚Ä∂ said the blonde. ‚Ä∂Because I'm ready to go and start feasting right now.‚Ä∂ And with that, she was now fully dressed, fully armed with her favorite axe, and fully out the door. And the question Nora wanted so desperately to ask her was still hanging in the air.<br><br>‚Ä∂So much for becoming courageous,‚Ä∂ Nora mumbled as she put on the only thing she was willing to wear, her belt with the scabbard for her new sword. She couldn't help but sigh as she sheathed the blade. She had thought all her problems would be solved once she claimed the Lionheart as her own, and for a while, it seemed like they had been. She could now charge and fight and defend that which she cherished above all. But it seemed that now, she was starting to get a whole host of new problems, from ancient evil kings having it out for her to‚Ä¶ whatever weird feeling was going on inside that was making her stomach do cartwheels around Annie.<br><br>Of course, now that the subject crossed her mind, it wasn't just cartwheels her stomach was doing. Come to think of it, it has been a while since I ate anything, she mused with a light chuckle as her stomach growled loudly enough to wake the Frigid King again. I suppose I can worry about these‚Ä¶ feelings until after supper at least. And who knows? Maybe I'll get the courage to talk to her again once everyone sees the new brave warrior that I've become?<br><br>Nodding with satisfaction at her little plan, Nora secured the belt around her waist, rested her hand upon the jeweled pommel of the Lionheart Sword, and nakedly set out into the village, her breasts bouncing, her hips swaying, and the cool evening air coating every inch of her now bare skin. This was her life now, and whatever trials and tribulations it would deal her, she would courageously face them head on. For she was Naturally Nora, the new Warrior of Flesh.<br><br><strong>The End</strong>"
