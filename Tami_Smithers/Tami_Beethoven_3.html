      { title: "Chapter 37", content: "The band milled around in the track area, between the Dad's Club stand and the end zone, waiting for the signal from Sarge to get into formation for the halftime show. They had gotten used to the clear plastic ponchos that covered them. It was a struggle at first, but once they were fully on down to your knees, and you got your instrument organized under it, they were not so bad.<br><br>The band was trying to relax. But the mobile camera truck loomed over them like it was a tank. They knew they'd be on the local TV news tonight, watched at home by their families, their parents, and most embarrassingly, by their younger siblings. Embarrassing, that is, if something went wrong.<br><br>So the air of casualness and joking around was forced. He played with his trombone slide and shot the breeze with Jamal and Jaysee, who was on a crutch, his calf bandaged up, out of the game and a lot more relaxed than his friends. Others paced, chatted, blew through their instruments. The color guard, which would lead the formation, hovered near the edge of the field, straightening their jackets, making sure the flag holders were secure. To have the flag drop would be a disaster. As for the cheerleaders, not involved in the halftime show, they were sipping diet sodas at the Dad's Club.<br><br>One of the more relaxed band members was Brigid, near the fence, talking idly with one of the police, Office McElroy, who he remembered was her uncle. He was a big beefy Irish cop kind of guy, with a jolly face, in his heavy coat, gloves, with ear muffs and a ski mask under his cap. On a cold day a guy like him, whose job was just to stand around, had to bundle up. He had pulled the ski mask down to his chin so he could talk. Usually he was three times Brigid's size, but with him all bundled up next to her in her tiny uniform, it was more like ten times.<br><br>The two were laughing at something, Brigid's circlets jiggling, flexing her purple toes, idly scratching her butt with her baton. In the chilly, damp wind, her body was a raw red from head to toes, though a little whitish blotch could be seen where the hot tea had splashed her, on the inner slope of her left breast. If Officer McElroy was thinking about what his niece must be feeling like, he gave no sign.<br><br>They were joking around about the Star Wars present her brother had gotten at his recent birthday party, from what he could hear. As she scratched her left butt cheek he smiled. I know what Brigid's butthole looks likeâ€¦<br><br>Could anyone else see it? When she was sitting in front of him a few minutes ago, raising her butt to put that black blanket under her, her butt briefly was almost in his face. The string of her bottom, no wider than a shoelace, bisected her butthole; he could see the sides of her secret brown eye on each side. Well, it would never show in performance. Sticking her butt out at the crowd was not part of the majorette's routine.<br><br>Now Brigid, talking to her uncle, lazily tapped the baton against her shoulder, then dropped it and tapped it against her bare heel. Now she casually twirled it, joking with her uncle all the while.<br><br>The rest of the band, of course, had the benefit of the clear plastic ponchos, which it turned out also afforded some warmth and shielded them from the wind. After the last of the ponchos had been handed out in the stands, Brigid had looked down at the empty box. Whether this was a surprise to her or not, he couldn't tell. But it kind of went without saying that the majorette couldn't perform in a poncho. It turned out, like Sarge said, that he could slide his trombone under it, and the drummers could wield their drumsticks under theirs. But there was no way to twirl in one.<br><br>Actually quite warm now in his full-coverage uniform and plastic poncho, he looked at his band's majorette chatting nearly naked in the cold and felt in love again.<br><br>He sat across from her in one class, English. He was hoping she hadn't noticed how much he looked over at her. In her turtleneck shirt, jeans jacket, black jeans, Doc Marten boots â€” he could picture her naked body under it, knowing how she really looked underneath, the breasts that were hidden in the turtleneck, the butt cheeks in her jeans, the feet and toes in her Doc Martens. With no other girl could one do that. He felt like he had x-ray vision and was looking through her clothes. Then turned away before she caught him staring.<br><br>He imagined taking her to the prom, him in his tuxedo, and her going in her majorette uniform. It was certainly dressy enough for a nice party like that, though not allowed by the dress code. Where would she put the corsage he gave her? Maybe it could hang from a circlet. Or pin it one of the strings of her bottom, below the graceful ridge of her pelvic bone. Well, no, the string looked too thin and fragile for that. Better yet, clip it to her red hair, hair that would be braided up like it now was under her cap, so that he could see her lovely neck and bare freckled shoulders.<br><br>Sighâ€¦ He would never have the courage to ask her to the prom, of course. It was all he could do not to choke up in her presence even without planning on saying anything. As to what she would actually wear to a prom, he could guess. An elegant but modest dress, floor length, maybe sleeveless at the most. No bare shoulders, definitely no bare midriff or bare legs. Sandals, maybe. But covered up.<br><br>He shook his head, trying to stop fantasizing, but he couldn't. What if she went through the school day every day in her uniform? With everyone else normally dressed? He pictured her sauntering down the hall, talking with her friends, the clip-clop of her heeled flip-flops along with the thumps of their boots, her breasts jiggling and agitated as she laughed, the circlets dancing their crazy little ellipses in the air, her concave tummy moving with her breathing and laughing. Or playing in a concern in her uniform, with everyone else in their nice clothes, the boys in their ties, the girls in their black floor-length dresses. And in the clarinet section, among the black formal fabric, the bare beautiful white body gleaming in the stage lights as she played along with the other clarinetistsâ€¦<br><br>He cleared his throat and blew through his trombone, watching Brigid and her uncle through the corner of his eye. I'm getting all sappy. I hardly even know her. Yet it was hard not to be in love. Probably a lot of other guys were too. Now Brigid turned with her back to him, flexing her arms, changing the baton from hand to hand over her head, as she spoke. From her cap to her backless sandals she presented a rear view of total nudity interrupted only by the tiny T-string of her bottom that disappeared between her butt cheeks. Then she turned slightly. He loved her from that angle. The side of her breast came into view, but not so much that he could see the circlet perched at its tip. From this angle, she looked like she was topless.<br><br>Uh-oh â€” her uncle was looking at him, seeing that he had been looking at Brigid. â€¶How're ya doin', young fella?â€¶ he said.<br><br>He smiled and nodded weakly, thinking he was going to get some sharp warning from this big cop about ogling his niece. But the cop's smile didn't seem to hide anything stern.<br><br>Then Brigid turned and said, â€¶Oh hi, that's the guy who was on TV with me. Come heah,â€¶ she said in her Providence accent, waving him over.<br><br>Still not at ease with the cop, and nervous as he always was about approaching Brigid, he walked over, making a show of conscientiously blowing through his trombone under the poncho and checking the slide.<br><br>â€¶Yes, I remembah,â€¶ the cop said, with the same accent. â€¶You and Brigid put on a good show.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Th â€“ thanks.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Even though Sahge had us mahching for almost five hundred yeahs,â€¶ Brigid said. A reference to Sarge's slipup saying that the band was founded in 1527 instead of 1927. She laughed and he did too. He tried not to look at her circlets wobbling. The fine mist had given a sheen to her reddened skin. The scald mark was barely visible, a slightly less reddened area shaped like a flame, along the side of her breast, almost touching the circlet.<br><br>He smiled and looked down at his trombone, watching his high boots next to the red bare toes in the sandals. The mist had formed little beads of condensation on the toenail paint.<br><br>Now a gust of wind. â€¶Geez, it's cold,â€¶ her uncle said, shaking his arms under his coat.<br><br>â€¶Yeah,â€¶ Brigid said, shaking her bare shoulders. A rare acknowledgement from her. As she shook the circlets danced. And she smiled, enchantingly.<br><br>Now Sarge called her away and spoke to her, his gloved hand on her bare shoulder. He heard him say the word â€¶muddyâ€¶ but couldn't make out the rest. Probably giving her a pep talk to avoid the disaster of the pregame show.<br><br>Sarge shouted, â€¶Get ready!â€¶ As they assembled he said, â€¶Change of plan. There's a dedication to Roddington McNeil, I told you about that. He has a request. We're going to do â€˜Catch That Tiger' instead. Then Mr. Simonetti goes on the field with him and he gives aâ€¶ â€” he spoke in a stage whisper now â€” â€¶hopefully shortâ€¶ â€” back to loud â€” â€¶dedication speech. Then it's â€¶Stars and Stripesâ€¶, the full version.â€¶<br><br>Groans from the flute players. He said, â€¶Now this is the last halftime show of the year, so let's end in a big way. Remember â€“â€¶ he looked up and saw that it was beginning a light rain now â€” â€¶it's more important to look good and stay in formation than to get every note right. The ponchos are going to muffle the sound a bit anyway. But they're clear plastic and the formation is going to be very visible.â€¶<br><br>Sarge looked at the general drift of people from the snack area to the stands. Then, again holding his gloved hand on the majorette's bare shoulder, he seemed to count off five seconds and said â€”<br><br>â€¶Now!â€¶ (Tu go)" },
      { title: "Chapter 38", content: "The six snare drummers lined up behind Brigid and on her signal they began the rat-tat-tat of the opening salvo. This got the crowd's attention and there was an accelerated movement from the Dad's Club area up to the stands. Brigid's signal was to thrust her baton over her head, her breasts wobbling tightly before coming to rest. He loved the way those circlets moved in little, well, circles. Were they being propelled by those hard pink nipples they were screwed onto? Or did the circlets cause her breasts to sway more?<br><br>Once again he felt the possessor of secret knowledge, having seen her total nakedness and how the circlets were fastened onto her. He looked at them and wondered how far her nipples, stretched by the hidden grommets, extruded. The circlets themselves didn't seem to protrude very far. They made her breasts look slightly more puffed-out but that was all. Certainly nothing like that pointy bra Madonna wore in the 80's. He wondered how Brigid's nipples felt in this cold. Did the cold make supporting the circlets more bearable? At least it couldn't be as uncomfortable as those â€¶bulldogâ€¶ clips.<br><br>He took in the rest of her posture â€” her â€¶call to attentionâ€¶ pose. Her baton up in the air, her other arm extended behind her, fingers outstretched, one leg in front of the other, the rear leg bent slightly at the knee. Kind of theatrical, but that was the name of the game with a marching band. He saw something he'd noticed before. In this posture, the toes of her rearward foot were spread. Her pinky toe, the school colors meticulously painted on the tiny nail, was almost off the sole of her heeled silvery flip-flop and nearly touching the cold muddy ground. It looked so precarious.<br><br>But Brigid was strong and, as she began marching and everyone fell into formation behind her as she strutted, she exuded strength and confidence. It had not been a good day for her, one misfortune after another. Being doused by cold water from above. Falling face down into the cold mud which squirmed into her circlets and into her bottom, and squished up between her toes. Having hot tea spilling on the bare slope of her breast and down her tummy, icy water splashing over her bare feet and legs, having a freezing cold cloth poking into her pussy and into her asshole, her whole naked body plunged into ice water with her back against a big block of ice, finally having her nipples bit and stretched by pliers.<br><br>But that was then. She had put it all behind her. And now, as he and the other trombones marched out behind the drum majors, the cheering as the band came out in formation, the Tunemasters were supreme. Yes, being in a marching band was considered geeky. The uniforms certainly were, at least in any other setting. But out here on the football field during halftime, no other outfit would do. As they began marching in a circle around the field, each being careful to stay six feet behind the one in front, two feet from the one to the side, the crowd cheered more loudly, a cheering heard even after they started into â€¶Catch That Tigerâ€¶, and his heart swelled with pride.<br><br>This is where all that practice paid off â€” all those before-school practices on this same field, at the ungodly hour of 6:30 a.m., in all kinds of weather, enduring Sarge's benevolent but strict discipline, in the rising sun and often in drizzle and biting cold. Everyone in their regular clothes, with coats on when it was cold, though Brigid had taken her shoes and socks off to get used to marching in the majorette sandals. And now, here at the big game, in uniform, all the drudgery was forgotten.<br><br>The TV trucks seemed to be everywhere. He couldn't tell from his angle but he guessed there were cameras at every corner of the field. They knew this would be on local TV and probably the Boston local news too. This was their moment! All those guys who teased the band members for being geeky, they couldn't help but envy them at a time like this. The formation was excellent, the band sounded great, not a single flubbed note in spite of the chill. Looked great too. Even though all the band members except one were covered from neck to knees in plastic ponchos, the magnificent uniforms could still be seen clearly, moving in perfect synchronicity around the field as Brigid and the drum majors turned into the center and he hooked up with Jamal in front of him now, and the other percussionists in the rear rank, as the band formed a huge donut circling on the field. In the middle, it was out of his view, but he knew the drum majors were turning around in sync as they did their rolls, and Brigid was prancing and doing some throws.<br><br>The cheering continued, audible to him even through the music. The ponchos muffled the sound but only a little. It was beginning to drizzle, as he could tell from looking down on his poncho and feeling it against his face, but he couldn't hear the pitter-pat against the plastic, everything was so loud and alive! The cheerleaders, in the Dad's Club area, put down their sodas and just had to clap. Even the tiny bunch of Brookline fans in their little grandstand stood up, getting some circulation going, and seemed impressed.<br><br>Now was his big moment. It was his cue, as the first trombonist, the one on the left. Glancing down carefully while still playing, he stopped exactly at the 47-yard line and marched in place. The other trombonists, watching him, stopped with him. He looked forward as Jamal and his line pulled away. Now, he watched Sarge, in his unobtrusive position on the sidelines. Sarge was waiting for the band to bunch up into â€¶tightâ€¶ formation, just three feet between each rank. Now Sarge signaled. Still marching in place, Rod turned toward the crowd, as the band went into the â€¶Bâ€¶ part of the tune on the last go-round. The trombonists followed him and now they were in a line, working their slides in the direction of the stands.<br><br>In a moment, Brigid and the drum majors came down in front. The band played especially loud the last few bars. A few rim-shots from the drums, then some terrifically high throws from Brigid. He could see the wisdom of not having a poncho on the majorette. The baton would get all tangled up in it. One final throw, and then silence. And now cheers!<br><br>He couldn't help but smile. Smiling in formation was O.K. The cheers continued as Mr. Simonetti, with his wireless microphone and a folded-up umbrella, walked tentatively onto the field, at the sideline, about twenty feet in front of Brigid and the drum majors. The cheering had barely died down when he said, â€¶Let's hear it again for the Tunemasters!â€¶<br><br>More cheering, and some whistling. The drum majors stepped off to the right, and stopped in line. He looked to the left, at Brigid, whom he could see in profile, about ten feet in front of him, a little to the side, so as to complement, and not obscure, the presentation of the band in formation. She was in â€¶presentationâ€¶ position, hands on her hips, baton in her left hand (she was left-handed), again with one foot in front of the other, rear leg bent so that her rear foot was on its toes, the sole of the backless sandal separating from her heel. She was smiling too.<br><br>Mr. Simonetti introduced Roddington McNeil, and an incredibly old man hobbled onto the field with a cane. He had on a business suit, a fedora on his head, and rubbers over his shoes. He gave a labored wave to the crowd as Mr. Simonetti introduced him. The cheers seemed to be from the older parents. Nobody in the band had seen this guy before, though they'd seen his name on a plaque in the lobby, near the glass case that had the old band pictures and trophies. Mr. Simonetti motioned to the new scoreboard and asked Mr. McNeil to say a few words.<br><br>The old guy grabbed onto the microphone, his hand over Mr. Simonetti's, and began to speak in a quavering, old-man voice. He began speaking about when he first came to this school, in 1962â€¦<br><br>Rod realized this might be awhile so he glanced over to Brigid. What a fine view he had. In profile she displayed to him the slopes of her breasts, her flat tummy, one knee in front of the otherâ€¦ He was in love again.<br><br>He looked at her tummy. It was more like a hollow. She was on the soccer team, she was in good shape. He remembered again that time he had walked through her gym class, her doing exercises with the other girls in her T-shirt and gym shorts, sneakers and socks. So covered up compared to now. What a fine-looking tummy, flat and just slightly muscular. Flushed red with the cold like the rest of her, though her toes and fingers were a little purplish by now too. White girls' skin was so interesting.<br><br>He noted the smoothness of the tummy, down to her navel, then the long expanse down, down, down past her delicate hip bones, down, down, down some more, finally to the top of the tiny V-shaped uniform bottom. He knew what her pussy looked like now, and where her clitoris was, and estimated that they began just millimeters below the top of the little triangle of fabric. The skin above was flawless. How did she shave her pubic hair there? What did she use? A razor? Or some kind of cream like girls use to get the hair on their legs?<br><br>He thought of last year's majorette, Grenicia. During one of the halftimes last year, during a moment like this, he noticed she had bumps down there, some kind of irritation. Fortunately for Grenicia her skin was real dark and you couldn't notice unless you were up close. Maybe she shaved too close, or had some kind of allergic reaction to the cream she used. Brigid, with her white skin, could afford no such mishap. To have a red rash visible above her uniform bottom would look pretty bad.<br><br>Of course, Grenicia had been lucky. That whole last year, the band was blessed with beautiful weather. Every Saturday was warm and sunny, even into December. St. Patrick's Day was a nice day too. Brigid, at the time marching with the clarinets in a full-cover band uniform, must have looked at the majorette and decided to try out for the job when Grenicia graduated. There were about ten candidates, the way he understood it. And she got picked, the first white majorette in years.<br><br>And look at how it turned out! To begin with, the uniform got more skimpy. Grenicia's circlets were four inches across and, her breasts being a little small, covered almost the entire slopes. The uniform bottom had been bigger, the straps going around the waist, and around Grenicia's quite bigger butt, had been thicker too. The sandals had had a strap around the heel which was now gone. But the worst of it was the weather. Grenicia had strutted in the warm sunshine. But except for those first two Saturdays in September, poor Brigid had had to endure the coldest and wettest autumn on record. It was always raining, or windy, or just plain COLD, and sometimes all at the same time. Yet she strutted and marched and twirled as if it was sunny and 70 degrees out and as if being the majorette was a great honor that she was thankful for. Which it was, of course. Yet no one who saw this girl, this unassuming, really quite ordinary though pretty girl, walking through the halls in her jean jacket, talking with her friends â€” no one could suspect the steely strength within.<br><br>The old guy kept rambling. And now drizzle turned into real rain. Umbrellas went up in the stands, and Mr. Simonetti opened up his big golf-style umbrella so that it covered him and the elderly honoree. Still the old guy kept talking, Mr. Simonetti nodding with just the slightest indication of impatience.<br><br>Rod was glad for his poncho. In his full uniform with the thermal underwear underneath, he was not at all cold. In fact the poncho acted like a greenhouse and made him a bit warm. Not a feeling being experienced by the poncho-less majorette. Brigid stood there, in â€¶presentationâ€¶ pose, smiling, as the rain began to coat her flushed body. Her toes flexed every now and then but otherwise she stayed motionless to the extent she could. He watched as a thin sheet of water developed which ran down her bare back, turned at her sacral dimples, then dripped off the string surrounding her waist. Courses of water ran down further, around the Y-shaped dimple over the beginning of her crack, then washed over the two cheeks of her butt. Jamal was right. Brigid DID have a freckle on her butt, on the right cheek right near her butthole, about halfway down. Then the water ran down the backs of her legs. On the rear leg, it went down to her flexed reddened heel, then dripped off her heel down to the sole of her sandal, from which it ran down and collected under her toes. Through the corner of his eye he could see the TV camera guy, fifty feet away, the camera maybe trained on the speech but could he be actually trained on Brigid?<br><br>Rod looked at her frozen smile, as the rain dripped off her nose, off her chin. What was she thinking? Warm thoughts? He saw her start to shiver. That was not unusual. A scantily-clad majorette on a cold day was expected to shiver. It was part of the majorette's life. But still he felt pity as the freezing rain washed over her in its icy caress. He wished he could throw his poncho over her, no more than that, wrap her near-nakedness in his jacket, give her his long pants, his nice warm boots over her frozen feetâ€¦ He had a fantasy of the end of the halftime show, Brigid jumping into a hot tub set up on the 50-yard line, splashing around in it gratefully, a special chemical in it making her circlets and bottom dissolve, her warm wet body finally jumping up in triumph in her warm wet nakedness to the cheers of the crowdâ€¦<br><br>He shook himself away from this bizarre fantasy and thought of Brigid in happier times. Those first two Saturdays in September were hot and sunny. The rest of the band was actually sweating in their wool uniforms and Brigid was having a great time. Maybe too great! There was the Bubble Gum Game, the second Saturday. Debra and Virginia had made the ill-advised decision to chew gum on the way to the field. What to do with it? Up in the stands, having to play â€¶Fanfareâ€¶, they had to put it somewhere fast. There not being any place to put it on their own uniforms, Brigid, who had no playing to do, offered her circlets. And so for the rest of the time up there one could see little pink nubs on her circlets. It looked for all the world like her actual nipples were sticking out through holes. It sure gave him a rise. Neither Brigid nor her girlfriends seemed to be aware of this, as they chatted during fanfare breaks and cheered the team on during runs and touchdowns. But to see Brigid jump up when Jaysee caught that long one in the end zone, the pink nubs bouncing up and down â€” he considered himself lucky to have taken in that sight once in his lifetime.<br><br>The old guy rambled onâ€¦ Mr. Simonette was trying, gently, to wrest the microphone away but McNeil had it in a death grip in his gnarled hand. Maybe he was trying to show how hardy he was despite his age, standing up and talking for a long time in this cold rain.<br><br>The rain got more torrential now, and now a gust of wind that almost knocked him over. Maybe others in the band too. Their ponchos flapped ferociously around them. Mr. McNeil, perhaps aware of this, spoke louder and closer to the mic.<br><br>Brigid adjusted her toes very slightly to the wind but kept in place, smiling, hands obediently on hips, baton wrapped in the fingers of her left hand. Currents of cold rain ran down the slopes of her breasts into the circlets, no doubt chilling her nipples before re-emerging below. Now there were drips coming from the undersides of her breasts, water accumulating, then dripping, accumulating, then drippingâ€¦ Cold rain likewise ran down her tummy into her uniform bottom, no doubt running in between her pussy lips, maybe going insideâ€¦ Cold rain washed down her butt, down her crack, no doubt running against her hidden buttholeâ€¦<br><br>Now with the increased flow the rain began going on top of her circlets and spouting off them. Like skiing, or one of those fountains in Italy you saw pictures of, where water squirts out of a statue's nipples. Two little streams, coming off Brigid's breasts. Now her shivering increased and the streams scattered.<br><br>How long was this old guy going to go on? Mr. Simonetti leaned forward to the mic, trying to say something, but the guy just kept talking.<br><br>He pictured Brigid shivering so much, that her breasts scattered the water like a lawn sprinkler. A comical sight. On sale now â€” the Majorette Lawn Sprinkler. Then he scolded himself for being so cruel. Still, he was beginning to get concerned about her. Sarge, under his umbrella in front of the stands, seemed to look concerned too. Hopefully the old guy was almost done. Unfortunately he had only gotten up to 1985 or soâ€¦" },
      { title: "Chapter 39", content: "He had been getting concerned and the fact that Sarge was concerned made him more so. Sarge had led a band in the Army for years. And this was his tenth year leading the Tunemasters. Marching bands were his life. He could handle any type of situation â€” like that time last year when Chelsea, one of the flute players, vomited during the Fourth of July parade. Sarge quickly snatched her to the side and got her some medical help, and moved the marchers around so that the march continued with hardly a blip. Fortunately Chelsea was O.K. But it was the kind of eventuality that he knew how to deal with from his years and years of experience.<br><br>But now Sarge looked uncomfortable and uncertain. This was a situation he had never had to deal with before. Majorettes had to get used to marching in the cold in skimpy uniforms, it came with the territory. But the marching kept them warm. Standing still in freezing rain was different.<br><br>Rod stood there miserably in his sweaty warmth, feeling the rain pelt his poncho, and underneath the poncho was his jacket, then his shirt, then his thermal underwear. The rain was a remote feeling, like being inside a house and hearing it hit the roof. But Brigid had none of these protections. The rain entombed her bare skin, the cold no doubt piercing her to the bone.<br><br>She shivered and the rain cascaded over her, into her circlets and her uniform bottom and deep into her most private crevices, then down finally over her bare purple toes. It was not just her toes. Her entire nearly naked body now had a purplish tinge to it. She had no place to hide from the cold.<br><br>And now it got worse.<br><br>The rain started feeling hard, like little stones. He looked down at the muddy field and saw to his horror that the rain had changed to sleet!<br><br>Yet Roddington McNeil, the old fool, kept babbling on. Mr. Simonetti was getting more insistent in trying to interrupt but Mr. McNeil kept on hogging the microphone. The people in the crowd, huddled under their umbrellas or under raincoats, were losing interest, rolling their eyes, no doubt joking to each other as to when this geezer was going to finish.<br><br>This was ridiculous. Everyone in the crowd is all bundled up, wearing gloves, under umbrellas, and Brigid was standing out in front of them wearing practically nothing. She stood as still as she could. Her smile was as frozen as the rest of her. And then, finally, a sign of weakness â€” one knee buckled and she had to switch feet. Now it was the right set of toes that was planted firmly downward, spread a little bit, purple from the cold, millimeters from the muddy ground, and the left heel that was arched up, the last few drops of rain dripping from it onto the sole of her miserably inadequate flip-flop. His feet were warm in their socks and boots. How he wished he could give her his socks!<br><br>At least with the ending of the rain she was no longer covered with the coursing of freezing water. The temperature might be even lower now but, with the cruel caress of the wintry wind like the world's roughest towel, her skin was drying quickly. Brigid's Rule.<br><br>He and the other trombonists decided to check out her goose bumps. A favorite pastime of theirs, on cold days, that is, almost every day of this football season â€” taking note of the many varieties of Brigid's goose bumps, where they appeared, how high and how many. Today was a record breaker. She had goose bumps all over â€” those on her her shoulders, her arms, and her legs were always visible , but the inner recesses of her butt cheeks were always where they were highest. Today they were monumental, sharp little mountains, going right into her crack, someone inside where the tiny hidden black string bifurcated her cheeks and pressed snugly and intimately against her butthole.<br><br>As the old man went on, Rod saw Sarge waving from under the little awning in front of the stands. He had gotten an extra coat from somewhere and was motioning as if to open it up. In other words, he was waving for Brigid to come off the field and put some damn covering on.<br><br>A drastic measure, perhaps unprecedented in Sarge's experience, but this was a drastic situation. Rod looked over at Brigid. The freezing majorette evidently saw Sarge â€” in fact, from where she was, it was impossible to miss him â€” and did not react. C'mon, Brigid! He sighed. She was stubborn.<br><br>His thoughts were distracted by the novel sight of the tiny grains of sleet bouncing off her bare shoulders. And the top slopes of her breasts. And her knees. With so many aspects to this new spectacle, each trombonist decided to pay attention to one. Rod looked at the shoulders. The sleet came down in one direction but bounced off at angles depending upon which angle of her beautiful curves they hit. The ones that hit the tops of her shoulders bounced straight up, then came down again, bouncing either in front or behind on the second bounce. The ones hitting the sides of the shoulders bounced off to each side. Some bounced up and fastened onto the lovely wisps of red hair under her cap.<br><br>Sidney, the trombonist next to him, watched the grains bounce off her cute little cap and the braided up hair below. George, the next one, was mesmerized by the scattering of the little grains by her breasts and circlets. The ones that hit the circlets shot out especially far out in front of her. Well, he figured, that made sense. The vinyl of the circlets was harder than the skin on the bare slopes of her breasts. Herman watched the sleet bouncing off her hips and butt. Deion liked the sight of her bare knee and how the white stones shot out in front as if she were kicking them. At the other end of the trombone line, Lorenzo watched Brigid's right foot and the specks of ice bouncing off her spread toes.<br><br>The sleet got a little bigger and fell harder, and made a real racket against the ponchos. It made it hard to hear McNeil and increased the sense of unreality, that this was some kind of dream. Though of course for Brigid it was all too real.<br><br>Sarge's waving became more insistent and he could detect Brigid shaking her head, as slightly as possible so as not to be noticed by the crowd, an incongruous gesture to her frozen smile. Then he realized that following Sarge's instruction was not a simple matter. The TV cameras were trained on the band as well as McNeil, in fact now that the speech turned out to be so boring they were probably more into the band. And it was certain now that the guy at this corner of the field was focused on the majorette. For Brigid to leave the field would be distracting and disruptive to the show, and possibly would be the one item to make the news. â€¶Frozen majorette can't take it any more!â€¶ The screaming headline on the Boston Globe. The show, the show â€” with a marching band, it was always about the show.<br><br>Still, hardy as she had become from all those days marching in the cold, Brigid must think of her health. And so the words came out of his barely moving lips, words that he couldn't really believe he had said until they entered his mind through his ears.<br><br>â€¶Brigid, go!â€¶<br><br>His first thought was that he was in big trouble, talking out loud in formation like that, but no one could hear him through the white noise of the sleet hitting the ponchos, except Brigid and maybe Sidney and George. He waited for a response. Then he cleared his throat and said again, moving his lips as little as possible so no one in the stands could see, â€¶Brigid, go and put that coat on! We'll be fine!â€¶<br><br>Shivering, she replied, â€¶I c â€“ can't!â€¶ He screwed up his courage and said, â€¶Don't be foolish! You're freezing!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Ya think I don't knnnnow that!â€¶ In her Providence accent.<br><br>He had confronted her and, in his nervousness, thought he had lost her friendship. So he had nothing to lose. â€¶I care about you, Brigid! PLEASE go get that coat on!â€¶<br><br>â€¶N â€“ no.â€¶ She closed her eyes â€” maybe trying to transport herself into a place of warmth, a hot beach maybe. Or under a hot shower. Or maybe thinking of herself as being one of the rest of her band, all covered up under a poncho, as if she was once again marching with the clarinets.<br><br>The sleet began to accumulate on her cap. Little crescents of white crust began to form on top of the circlets. Down below, the white grains were filling up the spaces between her toes.<br><br>â€¶Thank you, thank you, Roddington McNeil!â€¶ Mr. Simonetti said. The old man had had to catch his breath, finally allowing a space to jump in. McNeil looked around, as if awakened, then looked back at the band and at the majorette who was turning into a kind of frost-encrusted sculpture. â€¶Oh sorry â€” what a fine band â€” thanks for your time!â€¶ And with that he hobbled with his cane off the field, followed by Mr. Simonetti.<br><br>The sleet, as if on cue, ended. Now it was just a gray sky and a chill breeze.<br><br>The second the two men were off the field Brigid lurched into action. A bit more stiffly than usual, but it was oh so good to see her come to life. She spun on the sleet-covered muddy field, shaking the white crust from her cap, her circlets, her toes, and thrust her baton into the air. A loud roll-off woke the band up, as instruments went up to lips. And now the intro to â€¶Stars and Stripes Foreverâ€¶. A bit flubby, but by the time they were two bars into the first section they were back on their game. Their final tune of the year, a big finish, the grandest and most famous of all marching band tunes.<br><br>And one of the hardest, especially for the flutes. Fortunately the trombone part was not that hard. As he pumped away on his slide he smiled, watching Brigid twirl, at first slowly, but then her body went from purple to red, and her smile once again became the smile of a living person.<br><br>But â€”<br><br>Now she stumbled! The heels of one of her flip-flops sank into the mud." },
      { title: "Chapter 40", content: "Brigid stumbled, but only for a second. She didn't seem upset about it. In fact she seemed to expect it. Then, to his astonishment, hardly missing a beat she kicked the heeled flip-flop off to the side, where it landed on the 40-yard line, and on the next beat kicked off the other. And she continued her routine like nothing had happened.<br><br>Rod's eyes widened as he pumped his trombone. So did the other trombone guys. Brigid was strutting and twirling barefoot! Yuck! The sleety mud was up almost to her ankles, oozing up between her toes, as she spun and kicked. On her kicks to the side and front, little bits of mud flew out from her toes. Within seconds the school colors on her toenails were totally obscured by brown muck.<br><br>Yuck! What a violation of the rule about what Sarge always called â€¶neat and proper presentationâ€¶! Yet Sarge, on the sidelines, was actually smiling. And talking to people to his side, as if answering their comments. Rod realized this was what Sarge had been mentioning to Brigid before halftime, when he had pulled her away from chatting with her uncle the cop. â€¶If it gets too muddy, dispense with the footwear.â€¶<br><br>Now the showy part, and the trombones swung to the left and then to the right, in perfect sync. This was the beginning of the â€¶trioâ€¶ section, the main tune, and as they broke into it the crowd cheered. Nothing like your folks and your family cheering you on. It was a great feeling. The TV cameras were eating it up, scanning the field, each line of the band kicking and high-stepping, all the way back to the percussion line at the rear. But most of all the cameras trained on the barefoot majorette slopping around in the cold mud.<br><br>Brigid was having a great time. As she spun and twirled and threw the baton up, it looked like a different type of dancing. Looser-limbed, more relaxed. More African. She was so stiff and formal sometimes, it seemed like she had a second baton up her butt. But not now! It stood to reason that without having to totter on those heels, having to grip her toes to keep those backless sandals on, she could move around more freely. It also just was the sensible thing to kick off the sandals when twirling on a muddy surface. He wondered when she had practiced majoretting barefoot. Certainly each time he had seen her, doing twirls on that grassy patch during recess, she had worn shoes.<br><br>Her face was flushed, not with cold now but with exertion. Imagine! Not two minutes ago she was shivering and miserable and battling hypothermia. Now she was alive and hot. He realized for the first time what twirling meant to her, what a thrill it was for her. Nobody would suspect it, seeing her around school in her regular clothes, mostly a quiet normal girl, talking with her friends in the hallâ€¦ Now, dancing around barefoot and nearly naked in the mud in front of the crowd and the cameras.<br><br>And now as she swung around, her jiggling breasts leading the way as she threw them just so, she looked back at him and smiled. Just for him. His heart leapt. Yes!! She wasn't mad at him for confronting her about running off the field to put on that nice warm coat. He could see now that she had made the right decision to tough it out. How much would have been lost if at this moment the band's majorette was huddled on the sidelines.<br><br>But she was smiling at him â€” remembering that he had said â€¶I care about you Brigidâ€¶! He didn't know what the future would bring, but right now it looked promising.<br><br>With the sleet no longer hitting their ponchos, the band really rang out. Now on the final few bars they hit fortissimo. The drum guard's beats sounded like cannons. The big climax to the tune, the show, the season! Now Brigid threw an incredibly high throw, the baton going up what looked like a hundred feet, and she spun around and spun around like five times as it took seemingly half an hour to come down.<br><br>Holy â€”-! She was really going to do it! A split! Brigid turned to the side and her left leg went forward and her right leg back â€” and as her bare butt hit the mud, her muddy toes spread and extended in front, kicking out mud, she caught the baton on the final cymbal crash. The trombone players thrust their instruments up to the sky in unison.<br><br>A pregnant second, and then the crowd let loose with a big roar. He thought he could detect a chanting undercurrent in there, some guys in the back rows maybe, â€¶Frigid Brigid Frigid Brigid Frigid Brigid Frigid Brigid â€” â€¶<br><br>Sarge ran out and helped Brigid up. The insides of her legs were coated with mud but she didn't care. On his prompting everyone took a bow. Then Sarge playfully waved to the camera guy who was now within ten feet of them. Brigid waved too, with a big smile and a wink, her other hand tucking the baton next to her bare hip.<br><br>Rod smiled, looking at her flushed butt, her total nakedness from behind, interrupted only by the splatters of mud on her back, her buns, her legs, and the tiny horizontal string just above her crack, and he thought of her lovely hidden brown eye. Maybe it was winking at him now. It was corny but he decided to wink back.<br><br>Halftime show over, the band broke formation and trotted off the field as the football players, now assembled at the sidelines, waited to charge onto it. Brigid ran to retrieve her sandals; then zigzagged back to the fence, her toes kicking up bits of mud behind her. He watched her go.<br><br>She ran to the gate where her three little sisters and two little brothers were waiting along with her parents too, all cheering and laughing, and ready with warm washable boots, a big fluffy blanket to wrap herself in while they watched the second half, and a huge thermos full of hot chocolate!<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rod stumbled around groggily and realized he had thrust himself upright out of bed too quickly. He still had his shoes on, and his pants and shirt and jacket. For a moment he wondered what was dream and what was reality.<br><br>Knowing fresh air would clear that question up he ambled through the kitchen and out the door. Ahhhh, life is good. The sun was shining, the birds were singing. The smell of fresh earth, from the ground wet with the melted snow. A little chilly but spring was here.<br><br>And as he noticed the yellow VW half-out of the garage, he could make out the best thing about his life, evidenced by the bare legs and feet sticking out underneath, the soles gritty with grease, the fluff of plum-colored pubic hair under the bumper.<br><br>â€¶Hi, Baby,â€¶ Tami said as he approached, her hidden face still engrossed in her task. He bent down and kissed her on her lower hair. Then tickled one of her soles.<br><br>She giggled and with a good nature said, â€¶Sâ€”! You made me miss the eight-thousandths!â€¶ She was adjusting the valves, a task she did regularly, taking her sweet time, in her own happy world, her and the valves and the screwdriver and wrench and blade gauge. Tami the Motorhead. She had described the ritual to her friends several times. Rod as an engineer was proud he could understand her because most of her friends sure couldn't. â€¶The manual says to set the intake at .004 and exhaust at .006, but I set both at .008. It makes it a little noisy and there's a little less power, but what the hell, it's only 40 horses anyway, and it saves the valves from burning.â€¶<br><br>She had been almost finished when he saw her, and now she was done. She replaced the creaking valve cover with a little grunt and scooted out from under the car, her bare back scraping against the concrete. She wiped her hands on a rag and looked up at him, face speckled with bits of crud, grease marks on her bare shoulders, a black smudge covering her left nipple and areola like a circlet. He helped her up and they embraced in a full-body hug, she with the wrench still in her hand, he not minding any stains that might result on his clothes.<br><br>â€¶How was Providence, Babe?â€¶<br><br>They separated and she looked down. â€¶Sobering.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What, did they get along with Gretchen?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh of course they did. It's impossible not to get along with Gretchen. It's just that Dad works so hard at his store, with his heart condition he really shouldn't, butâ€¦ he was hoping Joe would be back by now to help him. And I found out they are really, really proud of me.â€¶ Her eyes got wet. â€¶They are such great parents I would do anything for them.â€¶<br><br>He saw her wipe her tears and then she put her head back under his shoulder. â€¶Oh Rodâ€¦ I am so lucky.â€¶<br><br>He let a few moments go by and then he said, â€¶I saw that DVD you left. Babe, you went through hell. I just can't imagine it.â€¶ Indeed. It was worse than being raped, he thought. A girl being raped could at least turn her head and try to think of something else. But poor Tami had to face that creep Ross right in the eye as she came and came and cameâ€¦<br><br>Tami hugged Rod more tightly, her toes squirming against the cold, gritty concrete. â€¶It was horrible. I tried to escape in my mind, tried to tell myself to get used to theseâ€¦ orgasmsâ€¦ But each one exposed my every nerveâ€¦ rubbing each nerve rawâ€¦ and I had to keep my eyes open! Oh Jesusâ€¦ I thought I was going to go out of my mind. The only thing that kept me from going crazy was thinking of the love of my family, and of you waiting for meâ€¦ that after theâ€¦ session was over I could go back into your arms.â€¶<br><br>He almost cried himself. As it was he sniffled, looked at the top of her head, and ran his hand through her plum-colored hair.<br><br>They stood there, embracing, listening to the birds sing. Tami's toes caressed his shoe and the leg of his trousers.<br><br>Then he said, â€¶Your parents should know how much you suffered for them. You should â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶NO!â€¶ Tami stood apart. â€¶Not ever!â€¶<br><br>â€¶At least tell them about being forced to â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶NO!! And you don't tell them either!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I wouldn't do that,â€¶ Rod assured her. It seemed so wrong, that her parents should not know about all her tribulations, or at least some of them, that she had suffered for their sake, so that she would not lose her scholarship and disappoint them. But of course she was right. Any disclosure would make her parents, and especially her excitable father, very upset. Maybe they couldn't do any more about it than Tami could now, but it would at least keep them awake at night. Nothing is more unsettling than a grievous wrong that can no longer be redressed.<br><br>He didn't like to see Tami like this, so worried, remembering her past travails. He hefted her into his arms, in a way glad to be the strong one for once, and carried her into the house. Neither one of them had to be anywhere for the next couple of hours." },
      { title: "Chapter 41", content: "The Spring Zing.<br><br>Rod was out of his element, he knew, as he sat with his leg crossed over his knee in his business-style suit. He glanced around quickly, as discreetly as he could from the front row, and realized he was overdressed. He had wanted to wear something â€¶niceâ€¶ but it was a good thing Tami dissuaded him from wearing a tuxedo. That would have been WAY out of place in the midst of this loose-limbed, flamboyantly dressed crowd.<br><br>Must be mostly gay, he told himself. He wondered if he was capitulating to stereotypes until he remembered Tami telling him that, yes, almost all the male fashion majors were gay, and actually most of the female ones too. Even in the dark of the Little Theatre one could make out the bright colors of the blouses and shirts and dresses. The focus of the show was the show, of course, the designs that the fashion students had been working on all year. But most of the students were fashion plates themselves. Even including Professors Girardo and Wanamaker, sitting to one side in their ascots, making notes, in preparation for grading. And Professor Ellen Winckel standing on the edge of the stage, announcing each design and reading from her cards, tall and skinny and fiftyish, in her sparkly green A-frame dress.<br><br>And including Tami, in her way. Yes, it was still plum colored hair on her head and down below. But the earrings were unusual, half-coral, half-silver, and her fingernails and toenails were striped in the same colors. He had watched her do them, at least the toenails, her feet splayed wide on the kitchen table, as he went here and there getting his tie and his shoes and his shirt.<br><br>On stage, it was not as bad a freak show as he had feared. No outlandish designs that looked like alien outfits from a Star Wars universe. Once again he found himself giving these fashion students some respect. Creativity was important but practicality was the key. These clothes were designed to be worn â€” more exactly, designed to be sold, to ordinary people who intended to wear them, if not every day, at least often. No dresses made out of balloons or paper clips. No shoes shaped like geese.<br><br>Unfortunately the models, few of which were fashion students themselves, more or less fit the runway stereotype â€” thin, curveless, walking down that runway with one foot crossing in front of the other. Weird. As an outsider Rod thought this over and over again: weird.<br><br>He inhaled sharply and felt his dick stiffen as supple toes wrapped around his sock-covered calf and inched up a bit like five little inchworms. He discreetly but playfully brushed Tami's bare foot away.<br><br>Now their attention fastened on the next entry, hers. Gretchen, battling her shyness, strode onstage in a tan-colored dress, tall and blond, chunky, with real curves, looking positively huge after the succession of skinny waifs.<br><br>â€¶This is Gretchen Spaulding, modeling for Tami Smithers,â€¶ Professor Winckel announced. â€¶In this instance the model is a co-creator of the dress. This V-neck midline is made of a fabric designed by Ms. Smithers and by Ms. Spaulding, a new polymer which has been submitted to the Department of Defense for approval. The name they have tentatively picked for this fabric is â€˜Cherish'. It is designed to afford warmth and alternately ventilation depending on conditions. I note that both Ms. Smithers and Ms. Spaulding have family members serving in Iraq.â€¶<br><br>The audience had been instructed at the beginning not to applaud until the show was over, but as one might expect, even though no others in the room had family in the military, there was respectful and quite vigorous clapping.<br><br>As Rod clapped he thought of his National Guard unit, the architects and engineers who had been marched around like infantry. Then his thoughts went to the dress Gretchen was wearing. The first item designed with Cherish â€” the name Tami had given to the horse that had saved her life in the Texas scrubland, whose color was much like the unbleached color of this new fabric. What a story â€” like so many others she had to tell concerning her cross-country trek, traveling on her wits, without clothes or food or money.<br><br>Truth be told, the fabric didn't seem to him to be quite clothing-ready yet. It seemed a bit too stiff and rubbery, like Gretchen was wearing a big white fried egg. Then he saw that her breast was about to fall out! With unexpected aplomb Gretchen shifted her hips just so, causing the V-neck to right itself. He heard Tami gasp and bring her hand up to her mouth with concern.<br><br>But all was OK. Gretchen smiled at the audience, a shy girl overcoming her shyness, and her body issues. The swing of her hips and her breasts as she turned to leave the stage was a nice touch. Flaunting her curves as if to emphasize that the other models didn't have any. He had to chuckle. He felt Tami's head lean against him and he put his arm around her bare shoulder.<br><br>Did she get an â€¶Aâ€¶?<br><br>He felt sure of it, as he put it to Tami and Gretchen in their kitchen, having a coffee before heading out to the party at the county airport. There was a two-hour gap between the end of the show and the beginning of the reception. This seemed odd to Rod and Gretchen until Tami explained that the Spring Zing reception was traditionally the time when fashion majors would romp around in their craziest creations, which they needed time to do up.<br><br>â€¶I'm not so sure myself, maybe a â€˜B' this time,â€¶ Tami said, sitting cross-legged up on the table as usual, then straightening her legs and stretching her toes out past the table edge, taking another sip. â€¶You did a good job hiding it, Gretch, but your boob almost slipped out.â€¶<br><br>Gretchen playfully hid her face in her hands. â€¶Lord, that was a close callâ€¦ For once I was proud to have hips and a big bust. Which reminds me, I hope the food there is good. I'm getting hungry. Oops, sorry.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No that's OK,â€¶ Tami said. Gretchen couldn't be blamed for being sensitive. With Tami meaning to â€¶wearâ€¶ her tail to the party, the naked young woman could not eat or have anything in her intestines.<br><br>â€¶It's a really good restaurant, from what I hear,â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>â€¶Strange place for a fine restaurant,â€¶ Gretchen said. â€¶In a small airport.â€¶<br><br>â€¶It's a pricey place to fly from,â€¶ Rod said. â€¶I suppose with such an upscale clientele, they wouldn't want just a burger stand.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well time to get into my Spring Zing costume,â€¶ Tami said, hopping off the table, soft footfalls on the floor, then off to the bathroom to use the big enema bag.<br><br>â€¶It's OK, you don't have to say sorry,â€¶ Rod said after his wife left. â€¶I still feel funny about it, but you know Tami, she's so strong-willed. It's her decision to wear that thing; no one's forcing her to wear it. Not like at that pony farm. It always amazes me how Tami can put that horrible experience behind her.â€¶<br><br>They both snorted at this unintended pun.<br><br>They talked for a while about Roger, Gretchen's fiancÃ©, flying missions in northern Iraq.<br><br>â€¶Iâ€¦ amâ€¦ ready!â€¶ Tami said, sauntering into the kitchen as if she were padding onto the red carpet at the Oscars, a little black purse clasped in her hand. She swiveled and planted the other hand on her outthrust hip, showing off the long, plum-colored hair flowing from between her butt cheeks almost down to her bare heels.<br><br>Gretchen had been told about the tail but had never seen it. â€¶Wowâ€¦â€¶ Tami allowed her a few seconds to take it in. The color of the tail matched Tami's pubic hair exactly, as well as the hair on her head. Tami wiggled her hips and the long delicate filaments swished back and forth like a thin jungle waterfall.<br><br>â€¶It's beautiful,â€¶ Gretchen concluded. â€¶Strange but beautiful.â€¶<br><br>Rod leaned forward to kiss Tami. â€¶Just like the rest of you.â€¶ Then he stood back, hands in his jacket pockets, as if to appraise the sight from afar.<br><br>Gretchen had already changed from her Cherish dress into her most formal dress, long, black, spaghetti straps. She looked down at her black pumps, and pictured how she might look in a costume like Tami's, all naked, her brownish pubic hair maybe bleached blonde like her natural head hair, black polish on the toenails of her bare feet. Maybe all the women at Campbell-Frank College had fleeting fantasies of being naked like Tami. Of course, actually being naked in front of people, well she would just die of shame! A stage through which Tami herself had passed a long time ago.<br><br>â€¶I'd better freshen up,â€¶ Gretchen said, and excused herself to go to the bathroom. By this she meant she had to pee, and brush her teeth again after having that coffee.<br><br>In the kitchen, Rod continued to stand back, hands in his pockets, looking at Tami flaunt her new accessory. The only clothes she could wear. They engaged in idle chit-chat. Then â€”<br><br>â€¶Ohh â€” â€¶ A flash of recognition in Tami's amazed eyes, then an accusing look at Rod. â€¶You absolute prick!!â€¶ It was the expansion of the tail inside. Then â€”<br><br>â€¶EEEEE!â€¶ Tami's eyes burst open and she jumped three feet into the air, legs splayed out, tail leaping up behind her, then she bent forward as she came down, hands hitting the floor, her crooked, trembling legs stretched out almost into a split, her crotch a mere foot from the floor.<br><br>Gretchen came back and stood open-mouthed in concern.<br><br>Tami looked up at Rod, hair scattered, and in a husky voice said, â€¶Rod, you are Evil â€” â€¶<br><br>Actually it was more like â€¶EEEEVV â€” owww!â€¶ She never got the whole word out. Again she leapt into the air, doing a half-turn, this time landing with her back against the counter, her legs spread and her crotch widely displayed almost in Gretchen's face. Gretchen saw the impish smile on Rod as he pulled the remote control out of his pocket.<br><br>For the first time Rod noticed that Gretchen had come back. â€¶Sorry Gretchen.â€¶ He seemed to have second thoughts to Tami too. â€¶Sorry Babe,â€¶ he said, turning the remote off. â€¶I couldn't resist.â€¶<br><br>Tami's concave tummy heaved in and out as she caught her breath, or tried to.<br><br>â€¶I suppose you have to do your hair up again,â€¶ Rod said. He seemed more contrite. â€¶Sorry again.â€¶<br><br>Tami looked down, breathing heavily, her toes spreading and grasping the floor.<br><br>In spite of being disturbingly fascinated, Gretchen felt compelled to say, â€¶Maybe I should stay in the living room â€” â€¶<br><br>But she didn't leave, wanting to stay. She couldn't help but see Tami's widely-spread pussy lips, the hard pink nub of her clitoris, palpating tensely.<br><br>â€¶N â€“ no, it's OK,â€¶ Tami said. Campbell-Frank's only naked student looked up at Rod. â€¶D â€“ don't leave me like thisâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Rod said, â€¶OK, Babe.â€¶ As Gretchen watched intently he started working the remote again.<br><br>â€¶OHHH!â€¶ Tami leapt and spun around again. â€¶OHHH!â€¶<br><br>Gretchen watched as Tami danced around. It was amazing how high she would leap with every stroke of Rod's finger on the little touch pad. Gretchen felt odd watching this spectacle, but then she told herself, â€˜This is what Tami does. Be naked and have orgasms in front of people. It's been a part of her life for so long she's become used to it. In fact it's been odd that I'm one of her best friends and yet I've been one of the few people on campus not to watch a Tami Smithers orgasm.'<br><br>With Rod's increasing finger pace Tami quickly crested. To Gretchen's shock she lurched forward and held Gretchen's hand to anchor her as her body spasmed, her feet slapping on the floor with each jolt.<br><br>Gretchen was amazed to see the tail wag back and forth with each contraction, like a dog's tail, or a horse's, or a cow's swatting fliesâ€¦ back and forth, back and forth, swishing with each spasm of Tami's internal muscles.<br><br>For a moment Tami looked up at Gretchen with eyes that seemed to be pleading, or maybe in pain, or maybe as if trying to say something but not being able toâ€¦ It was the strangest expression Gretchen had ever seen.<br><br>When it was over Tami dropped to the floor, on all fours, sweating, catching her breath.<br><br>â€¶Oh Godâ€¦â€¶ she said between gasps. Then she lay down on the floor, the tail sticking up, still jerking now and then. Gretchen and Rod watched silently.<br><br>Finally Tami struggled to her feet and said, â€¶I suppose we'll be fashionably late. I gotta shower again.â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 42", content: "She should have known that Tami could not sit down with her new accessory inserted. Gretchen smiled as she looked back at her naked friend, who had her knees on the rear seat, looking out the rear window. The things we women do for fashion. Uncomfortable shoes, tight bras, stifling nylonsâ€¦ not that any of these were familiar to Tami, except maybe as vague memories.<br><br>It was about five miles to the airport. Rod struggled with the gear shift of the ancient Beetle. There was a whirring sound and then the car shuddered whenever he changed gears. â€¶Sounds like it needs a new clutch, Babe.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Actually it sounds like the pressure plate's warped,â€¶ Tami said, looking idly at the road escaping behind them, elbows on the top of the rear seat. With both hands she re-twisted a little braid that had fallen onto her forehead. In the near-darkness of the little car Gretchen looked down at Tami's bare feet, sticking out between the front seats, caressed by the ends of the long filaments of tail, almost touching the gear shift. â€¶That's a big project though. Remember, fourth gear is 28.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I know, but I just don't have your touch.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?â€¶ Gretchen said.<br><br>â€¶At the right speed you can change gears without a clutch,â€¶ Tami said. â€¶Fourth gear is about 28 miles per hour on this car.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh.â€¶ Gretchen had driven farm equipment on her family's dairy but she never knew that.<br><br>She looked forward again, at the next curve in the road, and considered how they must look. Here I am in my formal dress, Rod next to me in his suit, and a naked girl in the back seat with a weird â€¶tailâ€¶ stuck into her rectum. It looks like Rod and I are a kinky couple and Tami is our sex slave.<br><br>She looked down at Tami's feet again, the spread toes. How human feet naturally look, she supposed, without being crimped by shoes. Prehistoric feet. And the hard soles that have walked on all kinds of surfaces, hot and cold, rough and smooth, for over three years. Tough yet sensitive. Last year, at a party in Rod and Tami's back yard, Tami's old friends Marisol and Desmond had come up. Desmond was blind and had little Braille blocks. Tami got up on a table, in the same position as she was now, as he pressed them against her soles. Tami got almost every letter right. Even after three beers.<br><br>What a super woman Tami was. Men stripped her and made it impossible for her to wear clothes ever again. Yet she turned nudity into an advantage, exploiting the unused abilities of skin, the same way a blind person like Desmond was able to use his hearing so well. Desmond could hear things nobody else could. He was the first to hear the distant thunder that day, five minutes before anyone else. Then the sudden thunderclap which everyone heard, and the instant downpour. They all hurried into the house except Tami. They watched as she scurried around covering up the grill and the food, her body sleek and wet, rain dripping from her chin and spinning off her nipples.<br><br>Now Gretchen's gaze traveled up the long, beautiful tail to where the plug nestled in Tami's widely-spread anus. She knew there was a bulb inside here, to keep the tail from being ejected, but even the plug part looked huge. Maybe an inch across. And Tami's anal ring holding it like a â€” like what? It was stretched out so there were no wrinkles. The only analogy Gretchen could think of had to do with sex. Like the mouth of a woman who is trying to suck a penis that is too large for her mouth.<br><br>Not that Tami would be eating tonight. Yet another sacrifice made for fashion. Preparing for an evening with the tail inside her, Tami had stayed off solid food today, drinking nothing but juice and smoothies, then done her enema thing a while ago in the bathroom. Gretchen detected a slight whiff of strawberry. She knew that a few of the TL's liked licking Tami up there and would bring flavored enemas that they asked Tami to take while they stood around and watched. Yuck. Even with all attention paid to cleanliness, licking an anus was a disgusting thought to Gretchen. Yet she had accepted that others could be turned on to it. Yet another surprise, part of being Tami's friend.<br><br>â€¶How you feeling, Babe?â€¶ Rod asked as he negotiated another turn.<br><br>â€¶Sehr gut,â€¶ Tami said, using one of her German phrases. â€¶So long as you don't try anything again.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, I took the batteries out,â€¶ Rod said. He fished them out of his pocket as Tami turned to look. â€¶And look.â€¶ The remote control came out of the other pocket, battery door swinging open and empty. â€¶Of course,â€¶ he said in a low voice, â€¶AFTER the party, they might find their way in again.â€¶<br><br>Tami giggled. Of course that would happen after they dropped Gretchen off. It was a little embarrassing for all of them when she walked into the kitchen as Tami spasmed. Gretchen couldn't get the image out of her mind â€” of Tami's pulsating pussy lips, pushed out from the bulky thing behind them, moist and wide open between her widely spread legs as she leaned back against the counter under the hidden assault of the moving bump massaging her internal centers of pleasure. And then to look into Tami's eyes! Gretchen could only stand it for a second before averting her gaze. It was too intense, like looking up at the sun.<br><br>Gretchen contemplated the tail filaments next to her, right over Tami's heel. Except for their plum color they looked like hairs from a violin bow. She couldn't resist giving one a little touch. To her surprise Tami grunted and her toes curled. â€¶That's got to be you, Gretchen.â€¶<br><br>Gretchen blushed at being found out. â€¶Wow â€” you could feel that?â€¶<br><br>â€¶The vibrations go all the way inside. My gut is very sensitive.â€¶<br><br>Gretchen looked up at her naked friend's firm, tan butt cheeks in amazement. Somewhere deep inside there, Tami felt what I just did. I've touched her way deep inside. Tami repositioned one of her knees and a few filaments slid across Gretchen's wrist. She had to admit it was a thrill.<br><br>â€¶This is very beautiful,â€¶ Gretchen said, stroking the filaments.<br><br>â€¶It was a bitch to get it all the same color,â€¶ Tami said. â€¶It's not real hair, so regular dye didn't work. Thanks though.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Can you wag it back and forth now?â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, only when I'm coming. Here. Let me try again.â€¶ Without appearing to move, Tami grunted, then looked back. Her anal ring wiggled a bit. â€¶No, only during, um, orgasmic contractions.â€¶ The hesitation in her voice â€” perhaps a slight, vestigial feeling of shame?<br><br>Gretchen felt brave and asked something that had been on her mind. â€¶Tam â€” I've heard that you sometimes â€” have an orgasm â€” while talking to people â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Never right in public,â€¶ Tami stressed. â€¶Never when there's professors or administration people around. But when no one's around, sometimes my friends like to lick me.â€¶<br><br>Rod snorted. â€¶Sometimes! More like ten hours a day! Those girls are inexhaustible!â€¶<br><br>Returning to her question, Gretchen said, â€¶Well how can you â€” talk â€” whileâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Sparing her shy friend the task of completing the question, Tami broke in to answer it. An answer that was well-considered and based on years of experience and thousands of episodes. â€¶There's only three things I can't control when I come. One is the anal contractions. The other is, my pupils dilate. And the third is my mind goes all fizzy for a few seconds. But when that's over I can replay in my mind what the person just said and stay in the conversation. So it's no problem.â€¶<br><br>For a few moments the three were silent, Rod watching the dark, winding road, Gretchen looking ahead and then glancing at Tami's feet, and Tami watching the road going away behind.<br><br>â€¶How many people at this thing, Babe?â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>â€¶Maybe 50, vielleicht. Professors and students, mostly. Some staff. At least that's what they say. I'll try to catch Professor Girardo and see how I did at the Zing.â€¶<br><br>It was unusual for Tami to talk so much about herself. But then again, this was her night. â€¶I'm getting inspired for that International scholarship.â€¶<br><br>Rod shook his head good-naturedly. â€¶They keep telling you the odds are a thousand to one.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well at least get picked as a finalist. That means I go to the finalist fashion show in Montreal next month. I want to make my parents proud.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I know,â€¶ Gretchen said. On that ride back from Providence she had seen Tami cry, unexpectedly. â€¶I have such good parents,â€¶ Tami had kept saying, before drying her tears finally as they approached the Campbell-Frank exit.<br><br>â€¶When will they tell you if you made it?â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>â€¶Soon, according to Professor Girardo. I have to go through an interview with this Dr. Lambert â€” I mean Lam-BARE,â€¶ Tami said. â€¶He's French. And pompous and a real tough guy to make a good impression on. The Prof wants to prepare me right beforehand, whenever that is. I get the feeling he's nervous about it, that he wants me to at least make the finals for the good of the school's reputation.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Whether you make it or not, I'm sure you'll do fine Babe,â€¶ Rod said. He fondled Tami's foot as if he was holding her hand. To Gretchen's surprise Tami's flexible toes grabbed up and enclosed Rod's fingers.<br><br>Another turn in the road and the trees cleared away into flat land and now, Campbell County Airport under the full moon. Rows of blue lights crossing the little plain, converging on the FAA tower and next to it, the little terminal, brightly lit, a newish three-story structure with a glass enclosure on the top floor. Small planes were parked in a line to one side. At first it looked deserted. But then blinking lights approached from the side, from over the trees, past the revolving red radar stand, a little ten-seat jet coming in for a landing. Another little airplane was taxiing its way around a far bend. A fuel truck passed behind the terminal. A guy in an orange suit walked across, disappearing behind the terminal.<br><br>They came to the sign that said, â€¶Welcome to Campbell County Airport and the Skyview Restaurantâ€¶. Rod turned into the parking lot. At the terminal entrance there were a few professor-looking types standing around, and a couple of students, gaudily dressed, passed through. One looked dressed as a dance hall dancer, the other in a Mae West outfit complete with long cigarette holder, though of course without a cigarette in it.<br><br>â€¶Time for your grand entrance,â€¶ Gretchen said cheerfully as she helped Tami out of the backseat. She looked down at the bare feet and coral-and-silver toenails pressing onto the asphalt, then up to the lower hair ruffled by the chill evening breeze, the concave tummy, the stiff nipples, then the braided hair framing the tanned face and luminous green eyes that caught the rays of the streetlight above.<br><br>â€¶Thanks,â€¶ Tami said. Then they followed her as she strode in front of them to the entrance, proudly and upright, the long flowing tail waving gently and sensuously with the swing of her hips, sweeping across her lithe but muscular calves." },
      { title: "Chapter 43", content: "It was a measure of Campbell-Frank's influence in this county that their naked student could stride proudly and effortlessly into the terminal. The security officers, having been warned, watched tolerantly and in bemusement as Tami and Rod and Gretchen politely nodded to them and crossed the simple little lobby and passed the information desk. Of course the sight of a beautiful naked young woman was not unpleasant. That her companions were fully and formally dressed made her nakedness even more striking. And seeing that tail swish behind her as she sashayed by, her little black purse in one hand, and placed her bare feet on the escalator, well, that was something they'd never forget!<br><br>The terminal had three floors, the first of which had the waiting area, the baggage claim, a newspaper stand, and overhead screens showing arrival and departures to cities like Boston, Cincinnati, Toronto, and St. John. As the three young people got to the second floor they saw the airport administration office and offices rented out to various businesses, the Campbell County Development Authority, and a flight school. The few people they passed glanced at Tami as if they couldn't believe what they were seeing, but then again, there were enough outlandishly dressed fashion majors going up with them that they provided her a kind of cover. Most assumed the tail was just somehow glued on to her outside. They could not have imagined that it was of a piece with a thick, 12-inch dildo that went up into her colon.<br><br>Another escalator up to the third floor, the Skyview Restaurant, and now one was in a different world. A world of elegance, with the muted lighting, the circular bar with two bartenders in tuxedos, the big cocktail area with the little high tables to stand around, the soft classical music in the background, the waitresses in their ruffled white shirts and long black pants. Around them, the blackness of night and the glass walls. The lights of the runways and the airplanes were like constellations.<br><br>And the hubbub of conversation, the place just beginning to fill up, with brightly colored and outrageous costumes of the students contrasting with the more muted tones of the professors and other â€¶grown-upsâ€¶.<br><br>It was now that Tami made her entrance. Not being a natural show-off, but realizing she would unavoidably be the center of attention, she strode in front of Rod and Gretchen. Conversation died down and she placed her hands on her bare hips, then turned slightly and shook her tail by shaking her butt. Maybe it would have been a shocking sight otherwise, but everyone had been told. Polite clapping and a few whistles as Tami turned and then, looking down at the carpet for a moment, did a graceful cartwheel, trained gymnast that she was, the purse still in her hand. The long strands of tail whirled behind her, a long spiral caressing her heels and her bare butt and finally wrapping around her hips as she came back up standing. Rod's mouth went dry and he felt himself getting hard. He shifted his leg a bit and was reassured that no bulge would show through his pants and jacket. His outfit was black and it was too dark to see in this place anyway.<br><br>They went to the bar and showed their I.D.'s and got their drinks. Tami got her usual, a martini. Rod was a beer guy but tried to be cultured and got a glass of red wine. Gretchen, after some indecision, decided on a rum and coke.<br><br>â€¶Hi Tam,â€¶ Trent said, hugging her. â€¶Woo!â€¶ That was Tami, looking down at his costume for the first time as they separated. Trent was in a body stocking with a fig leaf design sewn over his crotch. On his feet were red high-top sneakers. His blond hair was set up in braids. Then she looked at his companion, Cyrus, even taller and thinner than Trent, a handsome young black man with a goatee. Cyrus was similarly dressed.<br><br>â€¶We're Adam and Steve,â€¶ Cyrus said. Which got a good laugh, even from Gretchen, who was trying not to look at the fig leaf designs, both of which seemed to be hiding large bulges. What was in there? Socks?<br><br>Now a couple of girls from Tami's fashion design class, Claire and Joany. Claire was a very thin Asian girl who tonight was done up in a geisha outfit.<br><br>â€¶Socks with sandals? Isn't that a fashion crime?â€¶ Tami kidded her.<br><br>Claire said, â€¶Just for once I'm traditional â€” whoa!â€¶ Her flat wooden flip-flops were about four inches high and she tipped over onto Tami, causing a little of Tami's martini to spill onto a nipple. Tami flicked it off, causing her breast to jiggle.<br><br>â€¶Sorry, let me get you a napkin,â€¶ Claire said, lurching over to the bar.<br><br>â€¶No, that's OK. I'll get Rod to lick it off.â€¶<br><br>Rod felt his face getting hot. He would always be an outsider to this crowd. He sipped his wine. Yuck. It tasted sour to him but he tried not to make a face.<br><br>Now Professor Ling, the faculty supervisor for Tami's and Gretchen's polymer project. It was surprising to see him here. But as Rod looked around he saw some other professors he remembered from his math and science classes. It wasn't just the fashion crowd.<br><br>Dr. Ling said hi, his eyes fastened strictly on Tami's face. Then he got into a conversation with Gretchen and the two drifted off. Tami finished her martini and ordered another. Rod tried like hell to enjoy the wine.<br><br>Now, Roberto, the Student Government president, and his girlfriend Maria. Tami and he chatted a bit about the upcoming Activities Night. He said hi to Rod and made some small talk while Maria complimented Tami on her tail. â€¶This is quite an event,â€¶ Rod said. â€¶Some wild outfits.â€¶ They looked at a male fashion major across the room who was dressed like Barney the Dinosaur, only wearing a lacy white bra.<br><br>â€¶Yes,â€¶ Roberto said. â€¶Quite a juxtaposition.â€¶ His favorite word.<br><br>Professor Congi and Mrs. George. As usual they gushed. â€¶Beautiful tail, Tami,â€¶ Ms. Congi said. Rod watched as Mrs. George bent down to touch a strand and Tami jumped. The tiniest vibration thrilled Tami's gut. On a scale like that, bumps protruding from the dildo inside would be like an explosion. No wonder they made her jump halfway to the ceiling. He felt around in his jacket pockets, the empty remote control in one and the batteries in the other.<br><br>Now two of the Tami Lickers, Barbara and Melissa. Both were dressed pretty much the way they always did. Barbara was in a granny dress with boots. Melissa, tall and blonde and model-like, wore a black riding outfit, complete with cap. They tried to engage in small talk but were clearly preoccupied with their lust, a lust that found expression when Barbara said, â€¶I can't believe how lovely your lower hair is, in that color.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Thanks,â€¶ Tami said, placing her martini on the bar, looking down, opening her legs for their benefit, spreading her lower lips for the small circle of friends. Her toes spread on the carpet to anchor her. Through her spread legs one could see the softly swaying tail filaments falling like a soft summer rain.<br><br>â€¶If only â€” â€¶ Barbara said.<br><br>â€¶NO,â€¶ Tami said, sternly and playfully at the same time, closing her legs, the toes of one foot wrapping over the other.<br><br>The friends went to nibble on the little snacks on the bar. Rod felt his stomach growl but resolved that, if Tami couldn't eat because of her tail, he wasn't going to eat either. As usual Tami's nipples picked up his thoughts. â€¶Go ahead, my hungry man.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No.â€¶<br><br>Tami took another sip. She was about halfway through her second martini and, being Tami, none the worse for wear. â€¶I have to pee. Hold this, OK?â€¶<br><br>He watched as she cantered gracefully away, her tail swishing behind her, looking into her little purse probably for her lipstick. Those pony tails that white girls like to wear that go down their back; he would never look at one the same way again. He could probably count every vertebra, from her neck down to the crack in her butt. Having the tail in her made her stand and walk a little differently. She had to arch her back a bit, a little like bikini models do when they're trying to look â€¶hotâ€¶. Once again he counted his blessings. So many guys, and a lot of women too, lusted after her. But she was his.<br><br>After she was gone Rod tried another sip of the wine. Bleacchh. Then despite knowing better he tried a sip of Tami's martini and almost choked. Martinis were her favorite bar drink but he didn't know how she managed it. They were like pure alcohol.<br><br>Tami's tastes, he noted, tended to be extreme. She liked the shower water scalding hot, so hot he could never get in with her. Well, maybe that was understandable, maybe she was hoarding heat for when she had to go naked in the snow. But her coffee was the strongest he'd ever tried to taste. She liked spicy food â€” at the campus snack bar she used to order her burritos â€¶suicidalâ€¶, whereas he could manage only up to â€¶medium hotâ€¶. When she put on her iPod headphones while studying, the music was so loud he could hear it from the next room.<br><br>He loved Tami more than he had ever loved anyone, they were a team, they shared a life and knew many things about each other that no one else knew. He had seen her in all kinds of moods, in good situations and bad. Yet somehow he felt like he didn't know her. There was something about her that was as inscrutable as a sphinx.<br><br>Why was that?<br><br>It must be because her experiences were so different than anyone else's. That awful freshman year, in particular. Bad things happen to people, of course. What happened to Trent, for example â€” he thought this as he saw â€¶Adamâ€¶, across the room, holding hands with â€¶Steveâ€¶ â€” loosing your lover on 9/11. A horrible tragedy. Yet people lose loved ones, albeit not so dramatically. It was part of life. He thought of losing his own father two years ago, now his lonely mother had to sell that old house that was too big for her to take care of, and move in with his aunt.<br><br>But Tami â€” the terrified freshman forced to go naked all year, terrified to show the slightest sign of modesty. Strapped to that dildo machine at Chalfont, hundreds of unwanted orgasms, often while having to look at creepy people like McMasters and Henry Ross right in the eye. Having to go across the country naked, then captured on that pony farm. Nobody could imagine what all that must be like. You couldn't say all that was just â€¶part of lifeâ€¶. But looking in her eyes you knew all that hurt and pain was in there somewhere, a hurt unlike anyone else's.<br><br>And now she seemed OK. In fact, with this tail, like the one that was stuck in her at that pony farm, she seemed to treat the past like a little bit of a joke. How can she do that? Did her psyche have some superhuman ability to survive?<br><br>Maybe she was in denial. Maybe all those horrible feelings, all those memories, were being repressed, just so she could get through life. He could almost sympathize with Dr. Abu Jamal and Dr. Kantor over at Chalfont. It had been two and a half years and they hadn't been able to cure her allergy to clothes. Apparently the â€¶treatmentâ€¶ had all been external, testing her skin responses. Maybe the real problem was in her mind and they were afraid to go there, fearing the can of worms they might open up.<br><br>For now he just had to hope for the best. Presumably she could continue the naked life after graduation by staying on at the college as a graduate assistant. As a certain valedictorian she would have no trouble finding such a job. But how long could that go on? He chuckled, thinking of her newfound determination to get into the finals of that International Fashion thing. What if she actually got that fellowship? Going back to Providence â€” naked!<br><br>Well maybe he shouldn't chuckle. That her parents were supportive had apparently been a surprise to her. Once again, she wanted to make them proud.<br><br>And what about these dreams he'd been having?<br><br>Tami came back and got her martini and then who wheeled up to them but Homer Winant, working his wheelchair manually as always, in a business suit with his â€¶Grafton Transmissionsâ€¶ cap.<br><br>â€¶Hi Homer,â€¶ Tami said.<br><br>â€¶Hi,â€¶ Rod said, still not being able to fully trust this guy.<br><br>â€¶Hello friends,â€¶ Homer said. â€¶Congrats on having the best costume in this freak show.â€¶ What might have been an insult came out as a compliment, the way Homer said it.<br><br>â€¶Thanks,â€¶ Tami said, turning to show her tail, making a leg, one bare foot up on its toes.<br><br>They stood around for a moment as Homer ordered a beer. Then he said, â€¶Got something for you.â€¶ He brought a bag out from under his chair and gave it to Tami." },
      { title: "Chapter 44", content: "â€¶Wow,â€¶ Tami said, opening it up. Wooden platforms with metal runners underneath. â€¶A new pair of skates.â€¶<br><br>Specially designed by Homer so that Tami could skate at the little rink outside the gym building, which during warm weather served as an outdoor basketball court. They were just hard soles, without tops, molded to the contours of Tami's feet, with ridges between the toes so that she could grip them without relying on any strap which would trigger an allergic reaction. â€¶The old ones broke,â€¶ she said to Rod.<br><br>â€¶Yes I remember,â€¶ he said. That was about a month ago.<br><br>â€¶These shouldn't break,â€¶ Homer said. â€¶The old ones were wood, these are fiberglass. Go ahead, try 'em.â€¶<br><br>Tami dropped them to the floor and set them under her feet, balancing on the runners. Of course she could not jump in them but it was possible to grip them, with her well-developed foot muscles, so as to skate pretty fast. Others came around and looked down. She even managed to lift one and then the other, by squeezing her toes together. â€¶Thanks Homer. You're a genius.â€¶ Which of course everyone knew. She put them back in the bag. â€¶It's a little late for this year though.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Nonsense. We always have an April blizzard, and a cold snap. You know that better than anyone.â€¶<br><br>â€¶We didn't have one last year,â€¶ Tami observed.<br><br>â€¶Then we're due,â€¶ Homer said.<br><br>Tami sipped her martini and then said, â€¶Rod, I'd better chat with Ling and Gretchen.â€¶ And she left Rod at the bar with Homer.<br><br>Rod watched her go. As she chatted with the Professor, Mrs. George joined them, and then some guy from the local Chamber of Commerce. Tami knew how to comport herself on occasions like this. He thought of her adjusting valves the other morning, smeared with grease. And now here she was, as graceful and polished as a princess. He thought of the last time they had been at an elegant affair, last fall at that faculty â€“ administration cocktail party they'd been invited to, that black tie affair. Tami gracefully made the rounds, saying exactly the right thingâ€¦ totally naked, yet elegant in her braided hair and perfectly done fingernails and toenails, the carefully tended pubic hair. Acting like she clearly had the most beautiful and luxurious gown, yet was too modest to seem to be aware of it.<br><br>It was her hair, upper and lower. She considered her hair to be her â€¶clothesâ€¶. So she didn't really feel naked. Or at least that's what she said.<br><br>â€¶How's the engineering life?â€¶ Homer said, waking Rod from his reverie.<br><br>â€¶Oh, OK.â€¶ He forced himself to take another sip of that wine, then looked out at the blackness through the glass walls, the lights of the runway, lights of a little plane coming in for a landing. A thought hit him and he got concerned. â€¶Can't everyone out there see in here? Seeing Tami might distract them. Could be dangerous.â€¶ It sounded like a joke but he was serious.<br><br>â€¶Oh I don't know,â€¶ Homer said, looking out. â€¶Sure is pretty with that full moon. Everyone's too far away to see anything.â€¶<br><br>Rod looked up at the FAA control tower looming over them. â€¶What about that tower? It looks like tinted glass. They could be up there with telescopes.â€¶<br><br>Homer laughed. â€¶You're getting paranoid. That tower's got to be a hundred feet away or more.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Wellâ€¦â€¶ Rod looked up at the tower, then down at one of those guys on the runway in the orange vests, hoping the guy wouldn't look up at them.<br><br>To his relief Homer wheeled away to chat with Ms. Congi. Then Tami came back. A waitress passed by with snacks.<br><br>â€¶I keep telling you, EAT,â€¶ Tami said.<br><br>â€¶Noâ€¦ Babe, were you ever in band in high school? Were you ever a drum majorette?â€¶<br><br>â€¶No.â€¶<br><br>â€¶A cheerleader?â€¶<br><br>A sip from her martini. â€¶No.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Do you have an uncle who's a cop?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I have THREE uncles who are cops,â€¶ Tami said, pulling back a wayward strand of hair from her face and then scratching a nipple. â€¶I thought you knew that.â€¶<br><br>Oh, right. He met them at a family gathering last year.<br><br>â€¶These are weird questions. What's bothering you Baby?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Wellâ€¦ lately I've been having these strange dreams about â€“â€¶<br><br>â€¶WHOA! OHMIGOD!â€¶<br><br>It was Terry, Tami's old roommate from Pilgrim Hall! Dressed up in a killer outfit, white sleeveless blouse with a plunge neckline, a black miniskirt, fishnet stockings and spike heels. Leading by the hand a dark-skinned, Indian-looking guy in an open collar and brown jacket and dockers.<br><br>Rod got his share of hugs from Terry, and shook hands with the guy, who seemed about 40. In the rapid female exchange that followed he gathered that he was a publishing company executive, had a name that sounded like Karu, and they had been living together in Boston for the past two years. Terry hadn't changed. Always full of energy, admiring Tami's tail, catching up on the doings of Jen, Mayree, Dawn, the old gang. Rod thought of the great unspoken sadness, the third roommate in that room, Mandy, gone forever.<br><br>And now, Professors Girardo and Wanamaker, with something to say. They both seemed a little nervous. Did they already have a grade for Tami's entry in the Spring Zing? It seemed too early for that. What with the reunion of old friends, they knew they had come in at a bad time but whatever they had to say somehow couldn't wait.<br><br>Terry and Karu ordered drinks and it was as they were sipping them that Professor Girardo spoke.<br><br>â€¶Tami, we were impressed with your entry in the Spring Zing,â€¶ he said. â€¶I, uh, want to prepare you for something. I apologize but it was out of my control. Dr. Lambert is here.â€¶ Pronounced, of course, Lam-BARE.<br><br>Behind him loomed a very tall man with a distinguished-looking beard, a high forehead, and a three-piece suit that looked like it was from 1920 or so. Complete with watch chain going into the vest pocket.<br><br>His presence was such that conversation around them ceased.<br><br>â€¶Tami Smithers, meet Doctor Francoise Lambert,â€¶ Girardo said. â€¶Dr. Lambert, Tami's husband, Rod â€” uh â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sykes,â€¶ Rod said, shaking his hand.<br><br>The Doctor looked down at everyone like a king surveying his court. His words were pure noblesse oblige. â€¶Sorry for this interruption, and sorry for doing this to you, Ms. Smithers, but I am a very busy man and unfortunately I am being called away to Tokyo tomorrow on business. I will have to conduct your International interview now.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh â€” well â€” â€¶ Tami turned and pushed her tail back, embarrassed by it. â€¶I can â€” just give me a moment â€” â€¶<br><br>Dr. Lambert laughed gently. â€¶That's perfectly all right dear. You might not believe me but I have seen stranger, shall we say, â€˜costumes'.â€¶ He looked up into the middle distance. â€¶Personally I find myself more disturbed by the purple dinosaur with the brassiere.â€¶<br><br>There was polite laughter, sycophantic, but actually it was kind of funny.<br><br>He looked at Tami's martini. â€¶I must say, I will give you a pass if you have had a few drinks. I want to be sure you answer the questions with a clear head.â€¶<br><br>Tami replied without hesitation. â€¶No, I'm OK.â€¶ She put her martini on the bar, took a deep breath, and stood up straighter; her nipples sticking out and up at Dr. Lambert as if saluting.<br><br>Girardo's and Wanamaker's faces he saw that the fault was not theirs. And he could tell that they were hoping like hell that Tami would do well at this interview. Having one of their students make it to the finals in Montreal was important for the school. And, of course, important to Tami's parents and therefore to Tami. At the very least, even if she didn't get in, the way she conducted herself and how she answered the questions would be buzzed about around campus, and around the International design community, to her credit no doubt. He didn't know anything about fashion design but he was sure Tami would make everyone proud.<br><br>Dr. Lambert retreated and asked Tami to join him. He sat down at a table behind the bar where he had some papers out and a checklist of some kind. He asked Tami to sit across from him but she motioned that it was impossible with her tail. So she stood obediently, feet slightly apart, tail flowing down past her calves, waiting. At her request Rod stood by. Behind them, Girardo and Wanamaker sat at the bar, on tenterhooks, nervously sipping their wine. Gretchen was close by also.<br><br>It was like Tami was a finalist in a spelling bee. Rod watched as Dr. Lambert began with some kind words.<br><br>â€¶Let me say I was quite impressed with your efforts at the polymer you and Ms. Spaulding are developing.â€¶ He looked at Gretchen, who was now joined by Professor Ling and Mrs. George. â€¶You are working on the 3,2,5 ester, from what I understand.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Y â€“ yes,â€¶ Tami said, evidently surprised that this man had such technical knowledge.<br><br>â€¶I have here a series of fifty questions,â€¶ he said with some weariness, as if the long checklist was not his idea but he was resigned to it. â€¶I'd like you to answer them carefully.â€¶ He looked up at her. â€¶Of course for any fellowship given by the International, your composure during this interview is important and it will factor into your score. I apologize for the beauty contest aspect of this, but that it just how things are, if you want to represent the International and become a success in this business.â€¶<br><br>Tami cleared her throat and nodded. This was a heavier deal than expected. It was like she was being tested for worthiness to enter the outside world of adults.<br><br>He launched into the first question.<br><br>â€¶What do you see is the purpose of fashion design?â€¶<br><br>Tami must have expected this one. â€¶To make â€” uh â€“â€¶<br><br>Her eyes opened wide in surprise as the Doctor looked down at his papers, then she regained her composure as he looked up again. â€¶To make clothing that is useful, satisfies the wearer, and makes that person a â€” visual asset.â€¶<br><br>The Doctor wrote the answer down, as Tami looked at Rod with daggers in her eyes.<br><br>Rod knew exactly what had happened. Inside Tami, the tail had expanded into a three-inch bulb. As if he had pressed the white button on the remote.<br><br>He fished out the remote as quickly yet unobtrusively as possible, and showed it to Tami, the little door swinging from the empty battery compartment. He shook his head helplessly.<br><br>Then her body jerked and she gasped, a tiny gasp, and straightened up as the second question was asked.<br><br>â€¶What is the secret to a good line? You can give different answers for men and women if you like.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, it's the same for both.â€¶ Just a tiny quiver of the tail filaments betrayed what must have been happening.<br><br>Rod went into a silent panic, as Tami, suppressing an increasingly intense series of quivers, answered the second question in as even a voice as she could. Behind her, Gretchen and Girardo and Wanamaker watched intently, rooting her on. So much depended on thisâ€¦" },
      { title: "Chapter 45", content: "Dr. Francoise Lambert continued the interview that, if passed successfully, would qualify Tami Smithers for the final phase of the International competition, the fashion show and presentation in Montreal.<br><br>â€¶What type of shirring do you prefer in synthetic overgarments?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I should sayâ€¦ bias style, to reduce the risk of bunching.â€¶<br><br>Rod knew that the short pause in Tami's answer was to keep a gasp from interrupting the flow of her voice. From making love to Tami he was well acquainted with the telltale quiver in the legs, the slight tensing of the taut muscles in her tummy. The spreading of the toes. Dr. Lambert might have ascribed this to basic nervousness which would be only to be expected during such an important interview. Rod knew it was something much more profound, explosive, deep, disruptiveâ€¦<br><br>Tami's body jerked slightly. Fortunately the Doctor was looking down at his questionnaire at the time. Her nipples got even stiffer than usual.<br><br>As the Doctor recited his fourth question, the tail behind Tami quivered. Then it began waving back and forth like a dog's.<br><br>Rod looked on in horror and suddenly Barbara and Melissa were at his side. They were fixated on Tami anyway, no matter where in the room they were, but the glimpse of the wagging tail was like an alarm â€” they knew exactly what it meant and they were there like a shot. Rod and the two TL's looked at each other and then at the tail, still wagging from side to side, then at the face of poor Tami as she struggled to answer the fourth question.<br><br>Tami, bringing her hand up in a carefully controlled motion, scratched her head and paused, as if pondering what to say. Then after the last uneven wag, she gave her answer, no doubt having â€¶played back the question in her headâ€¶, as she would have put it.<br><br>â€¶What's happening?â€¶ Barbara said.<br><br>â€¶I don't know!â€¶ Rod said. Once again he brought the empty remote out of his pocket to prove his innocence.<br><br>â€¶Someone must have another remote around here!â€¶ Melissa said. The three of them looked around, glances darting all around the room in as subtle a way as possible.<br><br>â€¶Jesus,â€¶ Rod said, watching his naked wife listening to another question, standing straight up in her nakedness before the seated personage of Dr. Francoise Lambert, bare feet placed a foot apart on the carpet, her hands clasped primly in front of her plum-colored lower hair. â€¶Tami's really suffering!â€¶<br><br>â€¶She should excuse herself,â€¶ Barbara said.<br><br>â€¶No, Tami wouldn't do that,â€¶ Rod said. â€¶I know her. This interview means a lot to her parents. And to the school, I bet.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I like to see her come, but not like this!â€¶ Melissa said. She looked around. â€¶Some evil person is around here!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I didn't even think there was another remote!â€¶ Rod said. Then he exhaled and gathered his thoughts. â€¶Let's split up and check every person!â€¶<br><br>They tried not to be frantic but each of them bumped into someone as they turned. Rod scoured the main area between the bar and the entrance. Melissa checked around the edges of the room. Barbara checked around the circular bar itself. As it turned out everyone's hands were visible and nobody was holding anything except drinks and hors d'oeurves.<br><br>They met in front of the bar and watched Tami from a distance of fifteen feet. They saw the clenching butt muscles, and now the tail began moving back and forth again, back and forth, back and forth, every 0.8 secondsâ€¦ all the time she was carefully answering the Doctor's latest question. They thought of the explosive energy the tail detonated inside her, how it made her jump halfway to the ceilingâ€¦ all that energy now contained in the iron vise grip of her self-control, finding a crimped outlet now in the slight motion of her hand up to her head, smoothing away a lock of hair that had gotten loose from its braidâ€¦<br><br>In his desperation Rod decided to call on the assistance of Homer Winant.<br><br>Homer was on the other side of the bar, chatting with Gretchen, Professor Ling, Vanessa Congi and Mrs. George. â€¶Could I speak with you?â€¶ He decided to go for broke; Tami needed all her friends at a time like this. â€¶In fact all of you.â€¶ How to explain it? â€¶You see that tail Tami has? Well, it's not just a tail. Inside it'sâ€¦ it'sâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶It's a sex toy, yes I know,â€¶ Homer said. â€¶Works by remote, as I understand.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well here's the remote,â€¶ Rod said, waving it in front of them. â€¶See? I took the batteries out! Tami's going through that interview; and it's somehow gotten activated. Look!â€¶ They watched as the tail wagged again. â€¶That's what happens when she has an orgasm with that thing!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh Lord!â€¶ Mrs. George said.<br><br>Gretchen and Ms. Congi and Professor Ling looked with widened eyes.<br><br>â€¶Well tell that Doctor guy to stop the interview!â€¶ Ms. Congi said.<br><br>â€¶I'll try to butt in,â€¶ Rod said. â€¶IF Tami will let me. Meantime it doesn't solve the problem of thatâ€¦ thingâ€¦ noodling around inside her.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Can't she just pull it out?â€¶ Gretchen said.<br><br>â€¶No, it's expanded inside. That works by remote too. It's expanded to a bulb inside three inches across. It's physically impossible to take it out unless the expansion button is turned off.â€¶ Rod looked around. â€¶We've GOT to find that extra remote! We've looked around, and everyone here has, um, hands all accounted her.â€¶<br><br>Homer took charge. â€¶Let's move it! I'll speak to Hank, he's the security guy. We'll search the kitchen, the maintenance room, downstairsâ€¦ What's the range of the remote?â€¶<br><br>Rod remembered the TL's chasing Tami down the street and into Hightop Park. â€¶I'd say two hundred feet.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh shitâ€¦ it could be anywhere in the terminalâ€¦ Well, I'll get moving.â€¶ And he quickly wheeled past the bar and opened a door that said â€¶Staff Onlyâ€¶.<br><br>â€¶God, I hope there IS an extra remote,â€¶ Ms. Congi said, voicing what everyone was dreading.<br><br>They stood around helplessly, watching Tami suffer through another question. She idly twisted her toes against the carpet, then scratched a nipple. They saw her tummy expand and contract in a deep exhale. The Doctor was engaging her eye-to-eye. Rod and Gretchen, remembering the ride here, and Tami's description of uncontrollable orgasmic responses, wondered if the Doctor could detect the dilating of her pupils. Rod thought about what Tami had said about her trials at Chalfont, about how she tried to get used to them, tried to get used to the orgasms, but each one just ripped her heart out and shook her emotions to the core.<br><br>Professor Ling, quickly up to speed on this, said in his professorly manner, â€¶What if there is in fact no other remote? What if thatâ€¦ deviceâ€¦ inside her has simply gone haywire?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh God,â€¶ Barbara said. She and Melissa looked at each other. â€¶They'd have to extract it somehow!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Chalfont has an emergency room,â€¶ Vanessa Congi said. True. As part of a funding obligation the Chalfont Institute had a small walk-in clinic on the far side, where the highway was, that was open 24 hours. Not widely known among faculty and students. The college had its own health center, and the clinic dealt almost exclusively with people from the town.<br><br>â€¶We've got to drag her there first,â€¶ Rod said. â€¶And that sounds really dangerous. How can they take it out? They'd have to take it apart, inside her.â€¶<br><br>Though it was not visible through their elegant clothes, all four of them clenched their buttocks at the thought.<br><br>A man in a security guard's uniform bolted out of the â€¶Staff Onlyâ€¶ door and hurried out of the lounge and down the escalator. Conversation began to die down as there was a sense that something was wrong. People looked around.<br><br>Rod didn't want people looking at Tami, he didn't want a whole crowd of people witnessing her in her dire distress. So when he sidled back toward the table where the Doctor was interviewing the standing naked girl he did it as slowly as possible. Gretchen sidled over with him, leaving the three older people to look on from afar.<br><br>He got in next to Professors Girardo and Wanamaker, who had been watching the interview intently, not aware that anything was amiss, thinking that Tami showed a little nervousness â€” especially that curious nervous twitching of her tail â€” but was otherwise acquitting herself quite well.<br><br>Now all three looked on in alarm as the Doctor paused in the middle of a question.<br><br>â€¶Are you all right, Miss Smithers?â€¶ he said.<br><br>Tami's eyes were wet and a tear had trickled down which she was wiping away.<br><br>â€¶Yes â€” I'm OKâ€¶ â€” the tail began to wag, and Tami timed her words in between wags â€” â€¶it's just â€” hay feverâ€¦â€¶<br><br>The Doctor laughed. â€¶Oh I quite understand. I sympathize, my dear. I used to suffer from that as well.â€¶ How relaxed, how casual he was, as he idly tugged his mustache and looked down at his papers to continue the question, question number seventeen.<br><br>â€¶Gentlemen!â€¶ Rod whispered urgently to Girardo and Wanamaker.<br><br>â€¶Please, Mr. Sykes, we're busy,â€¶ Girard said.<br><br>Rod, realizing for all he knew he might be jeopardizing Tami's chances by doing just this, took Girardo firmly by the arm and led him away. Wanamaker followed.<br><br>In a carefully controlled urgency he whispered the situation to them. Both men turned in amazement to Tami's tail.<br><br>â€¶You mean she is having orgasms while being interviewed?â€¶ Girardo said, as if in outrage.<br><br>â€¶She can't help it!â€¶ Wanamaker said. â€¶We've got to do something!â€¶<br><br>Girardo was still having trouble assimilating this sudden and astonishing information. â€¶So every time that tail wags â€” I've counted ten times already â€” ten orgasms?!?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Her capacity is incredible. Look, she's beingâ€¦ violated. We've got to stop this interview!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh Jesus, this will torpedo our chances at the International for sure,â€¶ Girardo said. â€¶A candidate who's allergic to clothes, and now she's having orgasms during the interview!â€¶<br><br>â€¶You've got to stop the interview!â€¶ Wanamaker said, echoing Rod.<br><br>â€¶Well go ahead,â€¶ Girardo said.<br><br>â€¶No, you're the head of department. It's got to be you!â€¶ Wanamaker said.<br><br>He was right about that. Girardo drained the last of his wine and cleared his throat. He had obligations to the school but his obligations to his students were greater. He approached the table where the Doctor sat.<br><br>After a brief hesitation, he said, â€¶Dr. Lambert, I must tell you something.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Please!â€¶ the Doctor said in his most imperious manner. â€¶I'm in the middle of the interview. You know it shouldn't be interrupted!â€¶<br><br>â€¶But Doctor, this interview must come to an end.â€¶ Girardo looked at Tami, up and down, with concern that must have told Tami that he was aware of what was going on inside her. â€¶Miss Smithers is not able to continue.â€¶<br><br>â€¶NO! I'mâ€¦ OK â€” ohhh!â€¶ Tami blinked and her body lurched forward and she looked like she was about to cry, having betrayed her emotions for the first time with that little moan. With tremendous effort she straightened herself up, her toes grasping the carpet. â€¶G â€“ give me the next questionnnâ€¦â€¶ She looked at both men in the eye, with as even an expression as possible, pupils dilating. Behind her, the tail wagged again.<br><br>With a very presumptuous motion Girardo took Dr. Lambert by the arm and led him aside. He motioned for Rod, who quickly explained the situation. The Doctor looked at the suffering naked girl in amazement and approached her.<br><br>The distinguished Dr. Francoise Lambert, tall and elegant and exquisitely dressed in his three-piece suit, looked down at the naked five-foot-five quivering young woman, who strained to meet his gaze with wet, twitching eyes.<br><br>â€¶My dear, I'm very sorryâ€¦ I've been told about the, uh, device inside you. Under the circumstances we canâ€¦ postpone the rest of the interview.â€¶<br><br>Just then Homer busted onto the scene, wheeling in with an urgency that was very unusual for him.<br><br>â€¶We've looked everywhere. Nobody has any remote!â€¶<br><br>It was then, in the middle of an increasing circle of onlookers, that Tami Smithers shook and collapsed onto the carpet, her butt and the tail sticking up in the air, and began to sob." },
      { title: "Chapter 46", content: "In the midst of this elegant restaurant and bar, and the fully dressed, if outlandish, finery of the smart fashion set, the naked girl with the tailed dildo deep in her rectum was on the floor, on all fours, her jerking butt high in the air.<br><br>Absurdly, she tried to stand up and apologize to the distinguished men. Her tummy quaking, her navel twitching, she staggered up with a great, slow effort on unsteady bare feet as another crest washed over her, shaking her to the core. â€¶D â€“ doc â€“ torrrâ€¦ P â€“ p â€“ professsssorrrâ€¦ I'm s-s-so sorrrry youâ€¦ have to â€” ohhh!â€¶ â€” she bent forward as if punched in the stomach â€” â€¶Seee me like thissssssâ€¦ ohhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Dr. Lambert got up to speed much more quickly than Girardo had. â€¶We have to take her to an emergency room,â€¶ he said. He didn't look it but he was seventy years old, and gay, from an era when being gay was strange and abnormal and one tended to do other abnormal things too. He remembered the ill-advised experiments with tin cans, ketchup bottles, light bulbs. Embarrassing as it was, going to the emergency room was the only solution.<br><br>â€¶What can they do for her there?â€¶ Rod said. â€¶That thing inside her is too big now to take out!â€¶<br><br>â€¶They'll have to break it inside her.â€¶<br><br>â€¶How?! It will cut her up inside!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Make a plaster of paris mold around it, then crush it.â€¶<br><br>Homer said, â€¶How can they work inside her with her jerking around like that?â€¶ They felt like explorers climbing through the vault of Tami's rectum, looking for a way out. Meanwhile, in the outside world, Tami had crumpled to the floor again. The horrified and helpless circle of people looked on as she flopped around like a fish on a boat deck.<br><br>â€¶Anesthesia, of course,â€¶ Lambert said.<br><br>â€¶Would that work?â€¶ Rod said. Would knocking Tami out stop these intense reactions? This was different than when Spica and the other TL's were at the house that day, toying with Tami like a marionette on a string. The efforts of their fingers on the touch pad ebbed and flowed with Tami's crests and troughs. Here, it appeared that the moving bumps massaging and mauling Tami's innards were continuous. Which was scary. Maybe there was no devious hidden person with a second remote. Maybe the thing was malfunctioning, stuck on â€¶drive Tami crazy!â€¶ until whatever batteries worked it ran out. Hours? Days?!<br><br>â€¶Oh â€“ oh â€“ oh â€“ â€¶ Tami had flipped tummy up now, eyes squeezed shut, her hands and feet supporting her crab-like, jerking her open, palpating pussy up with each spasm, right into Lambert's and Girardo's faces. Her toes spread and squeezed in time.<br><br>As they watched this gruesome scene, a strange fascination took hold. Especially on the part of the men, witnessing this spectacular display of the female multiple orgasm. What was it like, to have an earth-shattering climax â€” and then, a few seconds later, have another, just as intense? And then another? And another? â€”<br><br>â€¶Somebody do something!!â€¶ Terry said. She and Rod looked at each other. The only ones there who had read Tami's freshman year diary, the only ones who knew the horrors the naked freshman had endured at the Chalfont Instituteâ€¦<br><br>Quickly Rod realized something. He pulled out his remote and saw Sarah Wickland's card that he had taped to it. He whipped out his cell phone.<br><br>Tami lay on her side, trying to catch her breath. â€¶Oh Rodâ€¦ please helpppâ€¦â€¶<br><br>He dialed the number of Mrs. Wickland's office in California, turning away from the scene so as to hear better, so that he faced the glass and the starry nighttime view of the runways. Homer wheeled around to his side.<br><br>His heart sank as he heard a recording. â€¶This is the law office of Sarah Wickland.â€¶ In fact it wasn't Sarah's voice, but the voice of her assistant Nina West. â€¶We are moving this week and will reopen at our new location on Monday, March 30. If you need assistance call the Encino County Lawyers Service at 555-2367.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Shit!!â€¶ Rod said. He said to Homer, who he thought should be in the loop, â€¶a damn recording!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Ohhh â€” â€¶ Tami was in tears, her face beet red, sweating, looking over at him. â€¶Please Rod! Help me!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'm calling Mrs. Wickland!!â€¶ he shouted back. With urgent fingers he tapped out the new number. So urgent that he misdialed. Cursing himself, he started over. As he waited, and waited, watching his naked wife in her dire distress, he tapped his foot. Finally a ring. Then another. Then another.<br><br>â€¶Good morning,â€¶ a sprightly female recorded voice said. â€¶Welcome to the Encino County Lawyers Service automated directory. Please say the name of the attorney you wish to contact. Say the first name first, then the last name. You can interrupt these instructions at any time. Don't worry, I won't mind.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Ohhhâ€¦ Godâ€¦â€¶ Terry held Tami's hand. Now Trent hugged her as she tried to catch her breath again. Nobody was counting but Tami was recovering from orgasm number fifteen.<br><br>Rod hated these voice activated menus. With as even a voice as he could manage, he said, â€¶Sarah Wickland.â€¶ A long pause.<br><br>â€¶Did you sayâ€¦ Farley Pickler?â€¶ the sprightly voice said. â€¶Say yes if I have that correct.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Please try again. Say the first name first â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sarahâ€¦ Wickland!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Eeee!â€¶ Tami wailed as she was pulled up to the peak yet again. Terry and Trent looked at Rod desperately.<br><br>A pause. â€¶Did you sayâ€¦ Perry Winkler? Say yes if â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sarah Wickland!!â€¶<br><br>A pause, punctuated by the sound of Tami's sob. â€¶Did you sayâ€¦ Scary Pinkler?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Get me an operator please!â€¶ Rod closed his eyes and felt about to cry himself, with frustration.<br><br>A pause. â€¶Did you sayâ€¦ Gotmolly Pease?â€¶ Sprightly voice.<br><br>â€¶Get me an operator please!â€¶<br><br>A pause. â€¶Did you sayâ€¦ Gremlin O'Reese?â€¶ Sprightly voice.<br><br>â€¶Get me a f**king operator please!!â€¶<br><br>A pause. â€¶Did you say . . .â€¶ â€” Trent was trying to give the rapidly dehydrating Tami a glass of water â€” â€¶Gotfranklin Reese?â€¶ Sprightly.<br><br>â€¶Get me a f**king operator please!!â€¶ Rod felt like hurling the cell phone through the glass enclosure.<br><br>A pause. A long, long pause. Rod wanted to curse but dare not say anything more. â€¶Let me transfer you to an operator.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Thank God!!â€¶ Rod said out loud. When he got a live person, an old-sounding female, he blurted out that he needed Sarah Wickland in a hurry. Then was told Sarah's cell phone was not public knowledge. He was in a private hell before he thought to say the magic words â€” â€¶Tami Smithers needs her right away!â€¶ Evidently the operator had a note allowing the cell to be given out if Tami called.<br><br>Rod tapped out the cell phone number and, afraid of what he might see, turned to look. Tami's body was upright and stretched out into an X, legs apart on the carpet, Terry stretching out her left hand, Trent her right. Her body was all red now and sweating, overheating, dehydrating. Jorge, the bartender, now began aiming water at her from the selzter spritzer hose behind the bar. Jorge must have been risking his job, knowing the water would ruin the elegant carpet. The arcs hit Tami all over, her face, her shaking breastsâ€¦<br><br>Rod thought of Tami in happier times, sweating after her grounds crew labors, being doused by Jose. And there was that dream about that damn majorette, marching in the freezing cold, then dancing in the jets of fire hosesâ€¦<br><br>After some hesitating, Jorge conceded the part of Tami that needed cooling down the most, and he began to concentrate the streams on her quaking, pulsating pussy. In an effort to tamp down her reactions, Barbara knelt in front, getting soaked herself, and pulled the outer lips open and apart as wide as she could, so that the ice-cold water could enter her womanly cavity. People crowded around to watch. Tami's eyes blinked and blinked with her gasps.<br><br>â€¶Sarah! Tami wore the tail to a party we're at and it's gone haywire! It won't stop! And it's not me! I had taken the batteries out of the remote!â€¶<br><br>â€¶That's impossible,â€¶ the concerned voice said on the phone. â€¶There's â€” â€¶<br><br>A moment of silence. Then Rod realized the connection was lost. Do I call her or wait till she calls me?<br><br>â€¶EEEE!!â€¶ Tami's eyes popped open." },
      { title: "Chapter 47", content: "Fortunately his cell rang right away and Sarah was back.<br><br>â€¶There's only one remote,â€¶ Sarah said. â€¶I made sure Stirchak destroyed the prototype. And right now there are no pony girls within a thousand miles of you. We keep track of them, you know.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Who's Stirchak?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Ted Stirchak. He's the guy who invented the new tail. A neurologist. He did the research about the crushing testicles â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Where is he? Could you call him? This is an emergency! I don't know how much more Tami can take!â€¶<br><br>A short pause. â€¶Yes I can call him. I'll be right back to you.â€¶<br><br>Tami had collapsed onto all fours, her head down. Evidently in a blessed gap between orgasms. Jorge had stopped spritzing. The place was quiet, everyone waiting to see what would happen. Tami's voice was heard, half crying. â€¶Oh Rodâ€¦ Rodâ€¦ helpâ€¦ EEEEE!â€¶ Her head jerked up and her eyes bugged out. Not again!<br><br>Rod watched as Tami went through the strangest agony a woman can know. She bucked back and forth like a bull trying to throw off a rider. And now, to his horror, he felt his dick getting hard! He was not alone. Almost every straight male was having the same reaction.<br><br>The cell rang and he was glad to focus on something else. This time it was a man's voice, with a strange accent. Gretchen, a native of upstate New York, could have told him it was a Buffalo area accent. â€¶Mr. Sykes! Is that you?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes!â€¶<br><br>â€¶I understand there's no time for chit-chat so let's go. There's an override code. Put the batteries back in the remoteâ€¦ OK? Now, press the buttons in this order, purple, purple, white, green, white, green, white. After that you're in override and you can press the black â€˜off' button.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What am I overriding? Is there another remote?â€¶<br><br>â€¶There has to be. The tail won't go on and on just by itself. It's got no internal battery and has to be activated from outside, and besides, there's an automatic shutoff if the signal doesn't vary for more than five minutes. I don't know how it happened but somebody must have made another remote.â€¶<br><br>Rod fumbled with the batteries and dropped them and then picked them up and finally managed to shove them into in the damn remote. â€¶So what's that sequence again?â€¶<br><br>He pressed the buttons as ordered and then, hovering close over Tami, pressed the â€¶offâ€¶ button and aimed the remote at her as if he was shooting her with it.<br><br>Nothing. Tami kept quaking.<br><br>He tried it again. Tami kept quaking, waiting for the next onslaught.<br><br>â€¶Well then somebody must be overriding the override,â€¶ Stirchak said. â€¶I just don't know what's going on. I'm sorry about this. Maybe an emergency room?â€¶<br><br>Now, an unearthly wail from Tami, as she looked up through the glass enclosure at the black night, and the full moon. Everyone held their breath as she launched into another orgasm, one she dearly did not want, as if in the last stages of an extended, tortured execution devised byâ€¦ some deviant geniusâ€¦<br><br>â€¶O â€“ ho! O â€“ ho!â€¶ It sounded like the wailing of a widow, falling on her husband's casket. With Tami on all fours like that, bucking back and forth with her tail, it might have seemed almost comical, a dog-bitch howling at the moon. That is, unless you loved her and cared about her.<br><br>Homer said, â€¶Let's get her the hell out of here and out of range. Meanwhile we'll look again for whoever is doing this to her.â€¶<br><br>Rod thought: Of course! Why didn't anyone think of this! â€¶Gretchen, can you work a stick?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Of course, I'm a farm girl!â€¶ she said.<br><br>â€¶You drive her to our house. Meanwhile Homer and I will tear this damn place apart.â€¶<br><br>Terry and Karu and Trent and Gretchen carried the sobbing, sweating naked girl away, holding up her entire weight, her bare feet making only occasional contact with the carpet. She seemed trying to bring her legs together but was unable. â€¶We'll follow behind,â€¶ Terry said as they left.<br><br>â€¶Let's get cracking,â€¶ Homer said. Again he divvied up the responsibility for searching each area of the terminal, among Rod, Trent, whoever else could help. It turned out everyone volunteered, without exception, including Girardo and Dr. Lambert. â€¶This time look into corners, into closetsâ€¦ When I find that creep I'll either run over him with this thing or strangle him.â€¶<br><br>It was ten minutes later when Rod got a call on his cell from Gretchen.<br><br>â€¶It's stopped,â€¶ Gretchen said. He could hear in the background the loud clatter of that old VW's air-cooled engine. He pictured Gretchen looking over at Tami, lying on her side in the back seat. â€¶She's crying a bit but I think she's about to doze off.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh thank God,â€¶ Rod said. At the moment he was sweating, shirt unbuttoned, sitting cross-legged in his destroyed suit on the floor of the restaurant kitchen. â€¶Ask her if she can pull that thing out.â€¶<br><br>â€¶OK I'll â€” oh wait â€” she already pulled it out. It's on the floorâ€¦ Tami? No, she's asleep now.â€¶<br><br>Wellâ€¦ it will be a good long time before Tami wants to have anything to do with that tail. â€¶Gretchen, thanks. Can you stay over tonight?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sure. She needs taking care of now.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Amen to that.â€¶<br><br>Rod sighed, the emergency suddenly over. He looked around him. He had searched under every cabinet, every table. Found out things about this restaurant that he rather would not have known. Like how dingy the sink was. But nothing that looked like a remote.<br><br>He wearily dragged himself up and went out to the bar, which Jorge had practically dismantled. Homer was there in his wheelchair. People were coming back from their searches, exhausted. Tables were overturned, papers scattered. The place looked like a bomb had hit it. In the corner, two security guards were conferring, each looking quite perplexed.<br><br>â€¶She's OK, out of range now,â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>Homer was frustrated and flustered, not a usual condition for him. â€¶I'll be danged,â€¶ he said. â€¶So it wasn't a malfunction, there is another remote. But damn well hidden.â€¶<br><br>The night framed Homer and Rod, up next to the glass walls overlooking the airport. They looked at each other.<br><br>Then their heads slowly turned up to the FAA control tower, unapproachable federal property, its silent tinted windows, black in the night, watching over everything.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Of course Tami had to call in sick but he made the calls for her. Everyone on campus knew what had happened; there was no problem with her missing classes and meetings, or her grounds crew assignments. Lots of e-mails asking how Tami was. He answered them all the same. â€¶She's resting. Thanks for your thoughts.â€¶<br><br>Tami slept for two days. Oddly, she felt uncomfortable on the bed, she wanted to sleep on the cold tile of the kitchen floor. A normal person could not do that but Rod kept reminding himself of her trip across the country nude, sleeping on rocks, desert sand, and stiff dry prairie grass. How he wished he could have rescued her from that. Yet it was part of what made her what she was: strong. He tried sleeping next to her on the floor but couldn't. Finally he dragged the couch into the kitchen and slept on it, waking now and then to look down at her.<br><br>Rod made meals for her and walked her to the shower. She was a bit dazed and dead tired. She drank huge amounts of water. He hated himself for having gotten aroused at her torture, hated himself. Yet it was probably a normal male response. He had heard a psychology major friend of his talk about â€¶the wisdom of the penisâ€¶ â€” what turns you on is, on some level, good for you. What a crock!<br><br>On the third day, a sunny brisk day with a cool wind, he came home and found the house empty. Then he saw that the TL's had set up a table in the back yard. Upon which was Tami. Each of the six of them was attending to a body part of their naked Queen â€” massaging her neck, her tummy, her arms, her legs, her feet. Yet staying away from her sexual parts. That must have taken a lot of self-control on their part.<br><br>â€¶We've done this three afternoons now,â€¶ Barbara said. â€¶I think she's coming around.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Indeed I am,â€¶ Tami said, surprising her acolytes, turning around and sitting up cross-legged. She sipped an espresso Melissa had given her. Then she leaned forward and hugged Rod. He pulled her up off the table and she wrapped her legs around him, massaging his butt through his pants with her tough heels.<br><br>He felt tears coming to his eyes. â€¶Thanks, girls, thanks,â€¶ he said.<br><br>After a moment, as if in thought, Tami whispered in his ear, â€¶Rod, let's make love. Nice and gentle. I want to get back to what love feels like.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh thank God you're all right!â€¶<br><br>The TL's knew to disperse as Rod carried Tami into the house.<br><br>Tami and Rod, after lying in bed for a while, hands clasped. They started slow and did manage to make love. Tami was lazy, drowsy at first, as if she was a virgin, uncertain as to where things might lead.<br><br>After about twenty minutes she had her first orgasm, a slow, rolling affair. They both sighed with relief, almost crying. Tami had not been permanently damaged by her ordeal. No doubt the love and concern around her had helped. As opposed to being alone and leered at in a cold, sterile lab.<br><br>Soon there were other climaxes.<br><br>But a problem surfaced. And it was not Tami." },
      { title: "Chapter 48", content: "â€¶Nnnhh! Nnnhhh! Nnnnnnhhhh!â€¶<br><br>Rod looked up at Tami as she crested yet again. He was so glad that she was back to her old self. That horrible experience at the airport restaurant must have been worse than her travails at Chalfont. True, she was surrounded by people offering love and support, even though they were helpless to do anything aside from hold her hand. Or her pussy lips. That was desperate, Barbara holding open Tami's pussy so that it would be filled with cold water. He supposed that would normally kill any woman's desire, even someone so used to the cold as Tami. But it didn't help.<br><br>â€¶Mmmmmmmâ€¦ mmmmmmâ€¦â€¶ Tami slowly rode him as she came down to the plateau.<br><br>It was grotesque, seeing the spritzes from Jose's seltzer hose shooting into Tami's opened pussy, only to see the water squirted back out again at 0.8 second intervals. A horrible experience for poor Tami. At least at Chalfont it was a controlled experiment. No one knew the cause of the pulsations of the tail deep inside her, it might have been a tail malfunction, going on and on and on, maybe a short circuit, a spark deep inside that might electrocute herâ€¦<br><br>â€¶Oooooohhhhâ€¦ love you babyâ€¦â€¶ Tami bent down to kiss him on the cheek. He expanded it to a tongue kiss and then she straightened up and threw her head back, her whole body trembling as she ascended again.<br><br>He cursed himself for not thinking of the obvious solution, finally arrived at by Homer, to get Tami the hell out of there. Then they both looked at the FAA tower and got a creepy feeling. It was only a hundred feet away, if that. To someone working a remote up there, the restaurant would be well within range. And with the glass enclosure, at night, he or she could see clearly what Tami was doing, and would enjoy the poor naked girl's uncontrollable bodily responses. Of course that was just a guess. Finding out what was going on up there in the tower was just unknowable. Even if you tried, you'd probably be suspected of being a terrorist. No, not a good idea for someone in the National Guard completing a scholarship obligation.<br><br>He was not much use to Tami during that airport ordeal. At least now, he was useful to her.<br><br>â€¶Zhhhhâ€¦ ohhhhâ€¦ â€¶ This one was mellow, calm, rolling. Not like her violent ones. He wondered what her mind was like right now, what it must be like to feel all that pleasure. Now that her orgasms were voluntary he felt more at ease asking himself the question he had pondered during Tami's torture. What was it like â€” to have a shattering orgasm, and then, a few seconds later, another? And another? And another? And â€” and so on? Whenever he came, spurting his seed deep into whatever orifice Tami had offered, he always needed at least a few minutes to get hard again. And then it was not easy to have a second orgasm, at least not the past couple of years. From what he knew, it would get even more difficult as he got older. Tonight, he hadn't come even once yet. He had gotten close at the beginning, but he knew he had to last, so he held back. As she was having her THIRD orgasm. And now, though erect, he was quite a ways from the desire to ejaculate.<br><br>â€¶Mmmmmmmâ€¦ mmmmmmmâ€¦â€¶<br><br>He looked out the window, to the hedges out back. He could still see them at night because of the streetlight. They were starting to bud, finally. April was almost here, after a wet and cold March. Tonight it was a bit windy. Now one of the azalea buds blew off and arced in a trajectory halfway across the yard, like a long fly ball, before landing in the grass.<br><br>â€¶Uhhhhhâ€¦ uhhhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>The trajectory of that bud â€” what year was that World Series? 1991? 1992? That fly ball that won the seventh game. Man, that was some series. Braves versus the Twins. His uncle Cabot, from St. Paul, was visiting with his family and Cabot was in heaven. Yeah, spoiled. The Twins had just won a series a few years before. Meanwhile the Red Sox were into the 70th year or so of their curse. At the time it seemed like the Sox would never ever win again.<br><br>â€¶Zhhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Every damn game of that series was a cliffhanger. And then that seventh game. He was only ten years old then but he remembered it vividly. Wait, let me adjust my hip so that Tami's clit gets a better pressure from my dick â€”<br><br>â€¶OH! Yes Rod! Ohhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Strange. It was one out and a guy on third, bottom of the twelfth inning or something like that. Who was that? Dan somebody. The batter was Gene Larker, he thought the name was, a benchwarmer, and he hit a fly ball that went over Brian Hunter's head in left field. Hunter didn't even try to go for it, he knew it would be deep enough to let that Dan guy tag up and score. He just started trotting in before the ball even landed, as the crowd went wild and Uncle Cabot jumped up and down, knocking his beer bottle over, while Pop smiled tolerantly and said, â€¶How about that!â€¶<br><br>â€¶OHH!â€¶ Tami's eyes bugged out as she approached a big one. â€¶OHHH! OHHHH! OHHH! Godddd! Zhhhhhh â€” OHHH!â€¶<br><br>WAS that ball really out of range? He wondered why Hunter didn't run back and at least try for it. The odds were a hundred to one, but this was the deciding play of the World Series, for God's sake. Maybe that Dan dude might have slipped and fallen on the way to home plate, twisted his ankle, torn a tendon. Things like that do happen.<br><br>Tami rested her gasping, sweaty self onto Rod's chest. He could feel her nipples poking into him. He massaged her back, right under the shoulder blades. Now she stuck her tongue way into his mouth. Rod returned the kiss and looked up at the ceiling, dully visible with the nightlight on, the Spiderman nightlight she said she had had since she was a kid.<br><br>â€¶Mmmmmâ€¦â€¶ Tami, her sweaty chest slipping over his, moved her hips so that her clit was pushing against his pubic bone. That had been orgasm number twenty-two. â€¶Mmmmmâ€¦ ohhhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>He looked at the clock radio. It was 8:17, that meant they had been at it for one hour and six minutes. Exactly one orgasm per three minutes. A pretty good clip. He wondered if he could get it down to once every 2.8 minutes. That would be a pretty good E.R.A. He remembered Tim Wakefield, the Red Sox pitcher, trying to get below 3.00, not always with success. Of course, knuckleballers are expected to give up some runs. The important thing is to give up fewer runs than the other guy.<br><br>â€¶Gg â€“ ahhh!â€¶ Tami jerked in response to a favorable motion against her clit. She tried it again. â€¶Gahhhhâ€¦ gggâ€¦ gahhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>That crack on the ceiling really has to be watched. Last week it was only a foot past the molding, now it was more like two feet. Something up there must be settling.<br><br>â€¶Ohhhâ€¦â€¶ Tami was going up again. â€¶Oh â€“ oh â€“ ohhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>The crack reminded him of the graph of a second degree differential, the one he was using to calculate the stresses on that dam project â€”<br><br>â€¶OHHH!â€¶ Tami's eyes opened. â€¶OHHH! Nnnnnn â€” nnnn â€” UHHH!â€¶ With a great heave she started bucking her hips in time with the spasms. Rod, looking at the crack, heaved along with her to the last, irregular jolt.<br><br>Tami caught her breath and stroked his face. â€¶Your turn, Babyâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?â€¶<br><br>A low, womanly giggle. â€¶I said your turn Baby.â€¶<br><br>Rod looked up at her. Then at the ceiling. Then he looked down at Tami's breasts and was silent and motionless for a moment.<br><br>Tami's eyebrows furrowed. â€¶What's wrong, Baby?â€¶<br><br>He tapped her shoulders and said, â€¶Iâ€¦ I just have to be alone a moment.â€¶<br><br>He got on his bathrobe and hunted for his slippers. Then he slid open the door in the living room and stepped out to the back yard and inhaled the windy cold air.<br><br>Five minutes went by before he returned. He found Tami standing in the middle of the living room, bolt upright in her usual posture. Breasts thrust out, hands at her sides, legs a little apart. She was covered with drying sweat, with her drying juices running down her thighs. There was a look of concern on her face.<br><br>Rod sat down on the couch. Tami sat down next to him, caressing his shoulder through his bathrobe. Her toes came up to caress his knee.<br><br>He exhaled. â€¶Babeâ€¦ I'mâ€¦ jealous.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Jealous of what?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Of yourâ€¦ capacity. I wish I could come over and over like you doâ€¦ And I feel soâ€¦ ROTTEN about it. I think of that DVD of you at Chalfont, being forced toâ€¦â€¶ He shook his head, then he made himself look Tami in the eye. â€¶And then what happened at the restaurant. That must have been hell.â€¶<br><br>Tami looked down and nodded. â€¶Yes it was.â€¶ She held his hand. â€¶But I had you there. That's why I didn't go out of my mind.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, yes, I know. But STILL I'm jealous. I'm always asking myself how it must feel, to come over and over.â€¶ He blinked and his eyes became wet. â€¶God, how crummy!â€¶<br><br>They sat like that for a few moments. Then Tami said, â€¶I had a feeling something was up.â€¶<br><br>Rod chuckled mordantly. â€¶I won't be up for long, if this goes on. What's in my head, I mean.â€¶ He chided himself for making such a juvenile joke.<br><br>Tami knelt between his legs and got out his limp dick.<br><br>â€¶No Baby, don't.â€¶<br><br>She toyed with it. â€¶You know Rod, I'm the one who should be jealous. I'm jealous of this. This magic wand. Sometimes I wish I had one.â€¶<br><br>Rod smiled weakly. â€¶It's not what it's cracked up to be.â€¶<br><br>She picked it up with one hand and ran her tongue under it, the sensitive part. Perhaps reluctantly, it began to stiffen. Then she brought her limber foot up and around. â€¶And these twoâ€¦ little items,â€¶ she said, hefting his balls with her toes, one by one, with her big toe and second toe, grunting as if they weighed as much as cannon balls. â€¶Mmmmhh! Wow that's almost beyond my strength!â€¶<br><br>She took his dick into her mouth like it was a lollipop and looked up at him with a blank stare.<br><br>He chuckled. â€¶You look really innocent.â€¶<br><br>She giggled, which with his dick in her mouth was quite a sensation. Then she gave his balls a closer look. â€¶Think of all the billions of sperms in here. Billions!â€¶ She looked up at him. â€¶What's female orgasm anyway? A way to feel good? But when a MAN comes, he's propagating the species. That's what life is about, what keeps life going. The male orgasm. When you come, it's like the whole surging wave of the universe goes through you, in that moment life goes forward into the future. No woman can possibly know what that feels like.â€¶ She sucked on his dick loudly, then with a final slurp let it fall. It was mostly hard by now and stuck out at her. â€¶That's why I'm jealous.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Your Catholic upbringing is showing.â€¶<br><br>She smiled. â€¶â€˜Every sperm is sacred.' As they say, you can leave the Church, but it never leaves you.â€¶<br><br>Rod picked up his dick and waved it back and forth slowly, appraisingly, as they both looked at it. â€¶Tell me, were you a good Catholic girl? Did you go to Catholic school?â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, but I went to Catechism class, every Monday. They'd let us Catholic kids out early for it. I was a pretty good girl. Well, except once, in third grade.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh? What happened?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well, we had gotten trained in First Communion, and you know how it goes? The priest says, â€˜Body of Christ', and you say, â€˜Amen', and he puts that wafer on your tongue. It's really dry and always sticks to the roof of your mouth, but you're not supposed to stick your finger in there to get it loose. It's like glue. Anyway, there's the priest, and the line of kids kneeling at the padellaâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶The what?â€¶<br><br>â€¶That low railing, it's called a padella. So it's, â€˜Body of Christ', â€˜Amen', â€˜Body of Christ', â€˜Amen', â€˜Body of Christ', â€˜Amen', When he got to me, he said, â€˜Body of Christ', and I said, â€˜I know.'â€¶<br><br>Rod laughed. â€¶Well DID you know?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Of course, I believed all that stuff, so I figured I wasn't being cheeky. I KNEW it was the Body of Christ and I figured I was just letting the priest know that I knew.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I bet you got a talking to.â€¶<br><br>Tami's eyes rolled. â€¶Oh Lord. The priest called my Mom, and then my Dad heard about itâ€¦ I had to confess it and my pennance was to say 50 Hail Marys.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Wow.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Actually we kids could rattle them off pretty fast. It doesn't take much practice.â€¶ Tami got up on her knees closed against each other, the rest of her upright as if at attention, breasts stuck out as if she wasn't aware of them. â€¶Watch.â€¶ She cleared her throat.<br><br>â€¶HailmaryfullofgracetheLordiswiththeeblessedartthoughamongwomenandblessedisthefruitofthywombJesusHolymarymotherofgodprayforussinnersnowandatthehourofourdeathamenHailmaryfullofgrace â€“â€¶<br><br>It seemed gibberish but eventually Rod slowed it down in his mind and understood what she was saying. By that time she had gone through about eight recitations. Stopping for a quick breath every minute or so, Tami got through all 50 of them before it got boring.<br><br>Rod clapped. â€¶You are forgiven.â€¶<br><br>Tami lay down against his thigh and played with his dick again. â€¶Do you feel better, Baby?â€¶<br><br>â€¶A little.â€¶<br><br>Now Tami knelt in front of him, holding his erect dick in front of her face. She made a little bow with her head. â€¶Body of Christ.â€¶ Then she inhaled the first four inches of it so as to make him gasp.<br><br>He could feel the surging wave of the universe beginning within him. Between his gasps he said, â€¶Oh Babe, you are bad. You'll burn in hell.â€¶<br><br>Tami giggled and between slurps said, â€¶Jesus wouldn't mind. In fact he'd get a kick out of it. I'm sure of that now.â€¶ And now she took him in even deeper.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The next afternoon, up in the woods miles away, in the little trailer overlooking the dam site, his subconscious mind was pondering what Tami had said, while his conscious mind was working on the plan for one of the dam buttresses, when his cell phone rang.<br><br>It was the polite, tense, Pakistani-inflected voice of Dr. Abu Jamal from Chalfont.<br><br>How odd. â€¶Mr. Sykes, I hope you are well.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, I am. What's up? Is Tami all right?â€¶<br><br>â€¶She's not here. I called to speak to you, to discuss her case.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Okayâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶It's best that we discuss it at our office here, you and I and Dr. Kantor, if you don't mind.â€¶<br><br>He put down his pen and switched the cell phone to his right hand. â€¶What's up?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Can you be at my office at seven o'clock tonight?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Tami has a student government meeting then.â€¶<br><br>â€¶She doesn't need to be there, just you. I am glad that she would be otherwise engaged. I ask that you not tell her where you will be.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Umâ€¦ OK I'll be there.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Thank you. Until later.â€¶<br><br>After the call was over he began to work on the plans again, but then called right back at the number on his cell phone.<br><br>â€¶Dr. Abu Jamal, Tami really should be there. I don't see why we should be keeping a secret from her.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Mr. Sykes, when we began our course of treatment we elicited from Tami an agreement that her case could be discussed with you, outside of her presence, if necessary. It's BECOME necessary.â€¶<br><br>He found it hard to concentrate on the buttress after that. Some time later he called Tami to say he would be working late. He hated lying to her. Fortunately it was on the phone. One should never lie to Tami, after all the lies she had been told, and lying to her face would just be impossible.<br><br>At seven o'clock, with a feeling of foreboding that had become overwhelming, Rod stepped into the office that used to belong to that old dignified German guy, Dr. Schnitzler. His successor, Dr. Abu Jamal, of a different race and culture but equally diginifed, greeted him. The room was just like before, portraits of old guys with beards, red textured wallpaper, elegant upholstered furniture, a small bar with brandy snifters to the side. He sat on the plush cushion of the Louis XVI style armchair.<br><br>Seated next to Dr. Abu Jamal's desk was Dr. Kantor. It was he who spoke.<br><br>â€¶Mr. Sykes. . . Tami's allergy is advancing. Significantly.â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 49", content: "Rod felt his shaved scalp prickle. Tami's allergy â€” advancing? How is that possible? She already was allergic to the tiniest scrap of clothing. She couldn't even put one foot into a flip-flop.<br><br>Dr. Kantor, a tall white man of about 60 with a closely-trimmed white beard, brought out a laptop and switched it on. â€¶We have been monitoring Tami's GSR, that's galvanic skin response, twice a week. I think you were actually at one of these sessions, as I remember.â€¶ Yes, he was, once. It was a disorienting experience, seeing Tami standing on a lab table, clutching a metal bar overhead, while Dr. Kantor and a couple of assistants passed loops of fabric around her.<br><br>On the screen of the laptop appeared a close-up of the top part of Tami's body, her face down to her breasts, nipples puckered up and even harder than usual. Her arms were evidently stretched out to the side, as if they were tied to posts. The background was gray and metallic and misty, like she was in a sauna maybe. Her face was passive, eyes closed, her hair tied back. Oddly, her face and breasts and bare shoulders had a purplish tinge. In the lower right corner, a little graph that looked like an equalizer graph you see on recording equipment, low vertical bars that were a placid green.<br><br>The image was disturbing, especially when he saw Tami's breath come out in little clouds and now an insulated gloved hand drew in front of her with a little swatch of what looked like fur. The room she was in was not hot but actually bitter cold!<br><br>â€¶This is imitation fur,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, â€¶used because of its ability to afford warmth.â€¶<br><br>Rod was a bit angry. â€¶She's â€” cold â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes,â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal broke in, â€¶to accentuate the natural desire for covering, we have held many sessions in our cryogenic chamber.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Kantor chuckled, â€¶Commonly known in the restaurant trade as a walk-in freezer. Of course, it's easier to get grant money for a â€˜cryogenic chamber'. During this session the temperature was, I believe, minus ten degrees Celsius.â€¶<br><br>â€¶But â€” â€¶ Rod was about to protest when he saw Tami's breathing get heavier as the fur was drawn closer to her left nipple. The clouds shot out from her nostrils, then her mouth. In the corner, the little bars leapt up into the yellow zone and then, briefly, into the red. Then the gloved hand drew away the fur and Tami heaved as if in relief. During all this time, her eyes remained closed as if she were in a dream, or maybe trying to think of being on a nice hot beach.<br><br>Now the image changed. Tami's bare feet on a block of ice! Her spread toes were very flushed. A contrast with the heavy boots and pants around her. Again, a mere wisp of fake fur was placed near her foot by a gloved hand. The toes spread even more and twitched. He supposed it was an allergic reaction, but one also imagined the freezing toes were agitated and frustrated by the presence of something they so desperately craved.<br><br>â€¶I hope she was all right,â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>â€¶Of course,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said. â€¶You know, of course, that Ms. Smithers is acclimatized to the cold. We were in that chamber for only fifteen minutes.â€¶<br><br>Now the image changed again to a rainy forest scene, melting snow here and there. The researchers stood in their lab suits and coats, safely dry under umbrellas, as the naked girl carried a large rock on her shoulder up an incline leading to the huge trunk of a tree. It was clearly a strenuous task even for someone of Tami's strength. Rod thought of some guy from Greek mythology, he forgot who, carrying a rock up a hill. Sisyphus? Atlas?<br><br>Tami leaned forward under the strain as her bare feet, covered with mud and small twigs, carefully scaled the hill without slipping. She had been out in the rain for a while; her hair was soaked and plastered to her back. Despite his concern Rod could not hide his admiration for the perfectly toned, evenly tanned body, sleek and wet in the rain, and his great luck that this most gorgeous of female creatures should be his wife.<br><br>Now another image, the same scene, only this time Tami was carrying a somewhat smaller rock, with a cloth tied around it. She struggled more up the incline this time, then straightened up as if arrested from behind and dropped the rock in front of her. She breathed heavily, her concave tummy heaving in and out as the rain continued to pour onto her hair and drip from her chin and her nipples.<br><br>â€¶I think you can deduce what is happening here,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, putting the video on â€¶pauseâ€¶. â€¶Tami has an allergic reaction to clothes, as we know. This has been carefully monitored. There have been fluctuations which we first could not explain, but turned out to be due to barometric pressure, academic stresses, even to an extent sunspot activity. But even taking these into account, in the past few months the GSR reactions have gotten noticeably more intense, as well as the loss of strength when cloth approaches her.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Let me ask you, Rod.â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal said, calling Rod by his first name for a change, â€¶Have you noticed anyâ€¦ changes recently.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Um, noâ€¦ Wait, yes. One time, a few weeks ago, she tried to touch a towel when coming out of the shower and it was, like a shock. She had to drop it. She said the towel felt like fire.â€¶<br><br>The two Chalfont doctors looked at him as if expecting to hear this, and expecting more.<br><br>â€¶Also, she felt sick and didn't want to sit on the couch. She felt better sitting on the tile floor in the kitchen.â€¶<br><br>He looked at the still picture on the laptop, Tami standing upright in the rain, looking down past her dripping nipples and muddy feet to the cloth-covered rock in front of her, in front of the clothed researchers. As he continued looking at this freeze frame, he decided she appeared to be in the middle of shrugging her bare shoulders.<br><br>â€¶Tami doesn't look too concerned there,â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>â€¶No, she seems to enjoy being naked,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said. â€¶As you know, any sense of shame was burned out of her long ago, at least to all appearances.â€¶<br><br>â€¶She doesn't think of herself as naked,â€¶ Rod said. â€¶She thinks of her hair, that her hair is her clothes.â€¶ He forced himself to add: â€¶Even herâ€¦ pubic hair, she thinks she's covered up down there.â€¶<br><br>Like Brigid, the majorette in those crazy dreams he'd been having. A â€¶uniformâ€¶ consisting only of tiny circlets barely covering her nipples, a minimal G-string below, skimpy sandals, yet feeling fully dressed and proud to wear her Tunemasters uniform. A modest girl who seemed to have no idea how naked she was. He had been trying to interpret those dreams. Brigid clearly symbolized Tami, and now he saw a similarity. Naked yet not an exhibitionist, in a world of clothed people. Brigid doing difficult twirling routines in the freezing cold while damn near naked, with everyone else's uniforms affording full coverage and with thermals underneath. Tami doing grounds crew work naked and barefoot in the wind and rain while people around her trudged by in their overcoats and boots.<br><br>He knew these doctors, at least some of them, were psychiatrists too, and had a fleeting thought of asking them these dreams could mean, what they might say about his own hopes and frustrations and desires.<br><br>Dr. Kantor interrupted Rod's thoughts to say, â€¶It's natural that Ms. Smithers would think her hair was her clothes. Seems like a reasonable adaptation, or perhaps rationalization. Young women tend to, if anything, obsess on clothes. They care about how their bodies are adorned and presented to the world. We tested Tami's psychological makeup and it is basically that of normal young woman, so she would be no different.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal broke in. â€¶But the Chalfont Institute bears a heavy responsibility for the incredible misfortunes that befell Ms. Smithers in her freshman year.â€¶ Rod could not know this, but at the moment the Pakistani doctor was thinking of how he probed and examined Tami's anus and pussy with Dr. Harridance as she lay spread-legged and naked on that cold steel table in the bright clinical light of Lab 13 upstairs, the terrified and mortified young girl afraid to protest or let slip any evidence of her burning shame. He had never gotten over his guilt and to compensate he was determined to get Tami's allergy cured. In fact, it was he who kept ordering Dr. Kantor to press onward even though no progress was being made. â€¶Ms. Smithers may be happy as a naked woman at Campbell â€“ Frank, a rather protected environment, but she will be under a crushing disability after she graduates.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes.â€¶ Tami could not fully see that, or maybe was pretending not to see that, but Rod could. He was glad the doctors and he were on the same page.<br><br>â€¶It's not just cloth,â€¶ Dr. Kantor added. He hit a few keys and now the laptop showed a bizarre scene. Tami, standing up on the table, arms at her sides, with a series of metal hoops encircling her, apparently supported by a metal post behind. The hoops were open-ended, the first around her head, then at six-inch intervals, the lowest around her ankles. As Tami stood there in her nakedness, eyes closed, someone twiddled knobs at a console and the hoops slowly closed around her, touching her skin, then opened again, at a regular pace, maybe once a second. It looked like she was being zapped with current, a strange electrocution torture, though her face remained impassive and she stayed motionless.<br><br>Now Dr. Kantor typed something and the equalizer bars appeared in the lower right again. They rose almost up to red as the hoops closed, then relaxed to green as they opened.<br><br>â€¶You certainly have measured her carefully,â€¶ Rod said.<br><br>Dr. Kantor did not detect the hint of venom in Rod's voice. â€¶It's very important, from a treatment perspective, to get accurate readings. Fortunately Tami's lack of modesty makes it easy toâ€¦ well, I know I'm sounding like McMastersâ€¦â€¶ The white professor blushed in embarrassment.<br><br>Rod let the silence punish the man for a few seconds before he decided that it was unfair. Kantor hadn't been involved in the McMasters horrors. Tami had once told him so. What they were putting Tami through was with the best of intentions. â€¶You mentioned treatment.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal said, â€¶It appears that Tami's allergy is to anything covering her or fastened around her, not just to fabric. This indicates that the allergy is not physical but psychological.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well that's clear isn't it?â€¶ Rod said, challenging them. â€¶How can you treat her if you don't know the cause of the allergy?â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal and Dr. Kantor looked at each other and then at Rod.<br><br>â€¶Actually,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, â€¶we now think we do.â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 50", content: "â€¶This is good coffee, thank you,â€¶ Rod said. Indeed it was. Better than that swill he had to drink at the trailer.<br><br>The three of them â€” Rod, Dr. Abu Jamal, and Dr. Kantor, were sitting in the lower part of Dr. Abu Jamal's spacious office, in elegant upholstered chairs around the little table upon which Dr. Abu Jamal's secretary, an older woman named Grette, had placed the coffee set.<br><br>â€¶As you pointed out,â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal said, â€¶Tami's allergy is psychogenic.â€¶ Rod felt strange. He did not doubt the sincerity or good intentions of these men, but it was odd for the three of them to be sitting here, in their business clothes, in this elegant setting, discussing their proposals on what to do to a naked girl, someone who did not have a stitch of clothes or shoes to her name.<br><br>He pushed these thoughts aside as he forced himself to listen as Dr. Kantor took up what was evidently a well-rehearsed presentation. â€¶The allergy certainly has something to do with the trauma of her freshman year. Tami seems on the outside as a normal girl, I mean young woman, but there is something about her that is unknowable, hidden. Almost Sphinx-like. This is perhaps what everyone senses. I believe it is not simple projection on our part, but an objective reality. In other words, it's not us, it's her. She really IS a little like a Sphinx.â€¶<br><br>Rod nodded. It was good to know someone else felt the same way.<br><br>â€¶The extent of the shame and mortification that Tami endured is almost beyond the comprehension of a normal person. Imagine being brought to orgasm against your will, and forced to look someone like Henry Ross right in the eye at the climactic moment.â€¶ As Dr. Kantor spoke, Rod remembered that DVD, and closed his eyes and shook his head. â€¶And that is aside from the shame of being forced to walk around naked in public, and on top of that, not being able to show any sign of being shy about it.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, I know, I know.â€¶ Rod did not want to be reminded of Tami's trauma, which only reminded him of his guilt at being so blind to it and possibly increasing it unwittingly.<br><br>â€¶How could that not have something to do with her allergy?â€¶ Dr. Kantor asked rhetorically. â€¶Perhaps it is evidence of a defense mechanism. Either a form of suppressing the shame, or adapting to it, a kind of â€˜sweet lemon' reaction.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sweet lemon?â€¶<br><br>â€¶The opposite of â€˜sour grapes'. â€˜I'm given this nasty fruit, but actually it's pretty good.'â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh.â€¶<br><br>â€¶One obvious piece of evidence in support of the â€˜sweet lemon' theory is her interest in fashion, in designing clothing, even though she can never wear any.â€¶<br><br>â€¶I think she would admit that. The, uh, psychodynamics are real obvious.â€¶ Rod felt pompous using such a word, but in this company it seemed fitting.<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal said, â€¶One can also deduce, perhaps, psychic pain from her orgasmic capacity and frequency, which we understand is quite incredible.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?â€¶ This was hard to follow. â€¶She comes so much because she's in pain?â€¶<br><br>The Director of the Chalfont Institute stirred his coffee, sipped it, and set it down. â€¶I speak as a man. Tami has, quite in abundance, the gift that women have for multiple orgasms. I've always been quite jealous of that capacity that women have.â€¶<br><br>Rod nodded. He barely knew these men, had nothing in common with them, except of course that they were all men. Maybe that explained why they seemed to be, surprisingly, on the same wavelength as he.<br><br>â€¶Forgive me for being so intimate, but a man experiences orgasm, ejaculates, and then is quiescent, unable to go further. But womenâ€¦ I ask you to imagine experiencing such an intense climax, and then, a few seconds later, experience another one just as intense? And yet another, a few seconds after that?â€¶<br><br>Rod, a little embarrassed, looked down as he nodded.<br><br>â€¶I simply cannot imagine how that must feel, after the intense and final catharsis, to continue to be aroused and experience another explosion of pleasure, another final catharsis.â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal, stilted and formal, was getting downright eloquent and flowery. Indeed he had always felt a little jealous of Tami's orgasms, a jealousy that competed with guilt knowing that so many of them had been unwanted. â€¶It seems to me like eating a huge chocolate bar, then another, then another. After one bar, I would not want anything sweet for a while.<br><br>â€¶But even among multiply orgasmic women, Tami is special. Understandably, given her past, she does not like her orgasms to be counted. But we are aware that there is a small, shall we say, club of female undergraduates who devote themselves to her pleasure.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, I know,â€¶ Rod said. He decided to volunteer information which might be helpful. â€¶They're called the, uh, Tami Lickers. Or the â€˜TL's' for short.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal and Dr. Kantor nodded, as if they already knew.<br><br>â€¶At any rate,â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal continued. â€¶We deduce that Tami experiences perhaps thirty orgasms a day, each one considerably longer and more intense than is reported in the literature as average. It could be that her unfortunate imprisonment in the equipment in Lab 6 increased her desire and her capacity. But maybe there is something else going on. Maybe after the chocolate bar, she eats something salty or bitter, so that the next chocolate is welcome, and then she eats something salty again, making her desire another chocolateâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶I don't follow you.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Maybe Tami suffers constant, if unconscious, psychic pain. Pain caused by the memory of her freshman year, or perhaps by frustration at not being able to wear clothes, or ongoing shame at being naked which in fact was never burned out of her, which in fact continues to this very day. That would be the salt. And each orgasm is a relief from that pain. That would be the chocolate. Another woman would get to a certain point and say, â€˜OK, enough orgasms.' But Tami still wants more.â€¶<br><br>Rod shook his head. â€¶I find this idea of â€˜unconscious pain' hard to believe.â€¶<br><br>â€¶As you walked to this meeting this evening,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, â€¶you were not conscious of your feet stepping forward, one after the other. Just as one can perform physical actions without being aware of them, one can think thoughts, or experience feelings, without being aware of them.â€¶<br><br>After pondering this, Rod said, â€¶So you think her capacity is an attempt to get rid of the pain, like an alcoholic who drinks to, uh, banish some memory.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Not a conscious attempt, but an attempt. Another analogy is, an average woman versus a drowning woman. The average woman paddles as she swims. Each paddle is an orgasm. The drowning woman paddles much faster. A lot more orgasms.â€¶<br><br>â€¶You think Tami isâ€¦ desperate, trying not to drown?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Unknown,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said. â€¶Only in-depth psychoanalysis would reveal her inner dynamics. They would be brought to the surface and she would become conscious of them. And that is the comprehensive key to treatment. Find out how her freshman year trauma caused the allergy, and you likely find the solution to curing it. But we dare not. We just dare not.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Why not?â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal said, â€¶In the course of therapy one would rip away Tami's defenses. In a sense those are her only remaining vestige of clothes and we would be stripping her even of those. She would once again feel all that shame from her freshman year, a shame that obviously she has suppressed. And what if our guesses are wrong, or there is more going on than we thought to address, and the allergy does not abate at that point? Tami would be naked and ashamed of being naked â€” and still not able to put on clothes.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Kantor said, â€¶To use a surgical analogy, you don't cut someone open unless you know you can sew her up again. Psychotherapy would be a disservice to Tami because we are not sure we have the sutures to sew her up. At worst she would end up a frightened, dysfunctional creature, possibly descending into psychosis, desperately trying to put on clothes she cannot touch without an anaphylactic reaction.â€¶ Rod had heard that word before used in connection with Tami's allergy. A person could die from an â€¶anaphylactic reactionâ€¶.<br><br>He remembered buying Tami that expensive dress, early in her sophomore year after Ross had left and Jorgon had gotten fired and she was freed of having to pretend she was a nudist. And Tami's pitiful, pathetic reaction as she told him for the first time that she had developed an allergy. â€¶Clothesâ€¦ please Godâ€¦ clothesâ€¦â€¶ she had whimpered, falling to the floor and stroking the forbidden fabric. Now, he pictured her in a padded cell, unable to wear a strait-jacket, flailing about, out of her mind, eyes rolled back in her head as she screamed herself hoarse as doctors in their coats and suits watched helplessly through the little window. â€¶CLOTHES! CLOTHES! PLEASE! CLOTHES!!!â€¶<br><br>He shook his head quickly, trying to shake this horrible image from his mind.<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal let this sink in before he said, â€¶You understand, Mr. Sykes, why we asked you not to disclose to Tami the content of this discussion.â€¶<br><br>Rod nodded.<br><br>The three men sipped their coffees, changed their crossed legs, adjusted their pants and jackets, looked down at their shined shoes, and contemplated the plight of the nude girl.<br><br>Finally Rod said, â€¶So what remains?â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 51", content: "â€¶There is a possible behavioral explanation for her allergy,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, brightening a bit. â€¶An explanation that was staring us in the face but we did not see it until recently. The explanation involves simple classical conditioning. It is like Pavlov and his dog.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?â€¶ Rod thought he remembered this from the intro to psych course he took as a freshman but he wanted to be sure.<br><br>â€¶A dog salivates when it sees food nearby. Professor Pavlov rang a bell whenever food was about to be given. Ultimately the dog salivated when it heard the bell, even though no food had appeared.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Rightâ€¦ So?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Think about Tami's experience. She comes to Campbell-Frank as a freshman, clothed and insecure. A year later she is popular, loved, by you especially, amazingly creative, getting straight â€˜A's. And naked.<br><br>â€¶From what we know of her early interviews with us, before the second week of her freshman year, she was clothed, she had no sex life except for very occasional masturbation. Now, she has what appears to be a fulfilling sex life with you, and a small army of friends whose sole purpose in life is apparently to give her as many intense orgasms as possible. Clothed, no sexual peaks. Naked, she has dozens a day.â€¶<br><br>Rod looked down at the coffee set. â€¶I see what you mean.â€¶<br><br>â€¶She has associated nudity with love, nudity with scholastic excellence, nudity with creativity, and above all, nudity with sexual pleasure.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Not just sexual,â€¶ Rod pointed out. â€¶She gets a lot of pleasure feeling the ground underneath her bare feet, the wind against her breastsâ€¦ Her bare skin touching everything around her.â€¶ He smiled with a bit of embarrassment. â€¶I'm jealous, tell you the truth. This sounds wack, but I wish I could go around naked too, roll around in the grass like she does. So long as no one sees me.â€¶<br><br>They all laughed, which broke the tension.<br><br>â€¶Our theory,â€¶ Dr. Kantor then said, â€¶is that the allergy represents the contrapositive of this association.â€¶<br><br>â€¶The â€” what?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Given a statement, â€˜If A, then B', the contrapositive is, â€˜if not B, then not A'. If a statement is true, then the contrapositive is always true.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh.â€¶ Again, a vague memory was triggered, maybe from high school algebra.<br><br>â€¶Meaning,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, â€¶that Tami associates nudity with pleasure, and has extended this to associate clothing with pain. Hence, the allergy to clothes. If the, as you say, the â€˜TL's', have been especially active and successful lately in their attempts to drive Tami to greater orgasmic heights, this would also explain the recent advancement of her allergy. It has only strengthened the association and hence the contrapositive reaction.â€¶<br><br>This was a lot to absorb. But after chewing this over, Rod said, â€¶That's irrational. Tami could be clothed and still have my love, and be creative, and have orgasms and all that stuff.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, but irrational does not stop something from being effective, at least not in classical conditioning. Let's say you were Pavlov's dog. Or that we devised an experiment where, I don't know what you like, say it's a steaming hamburger.â€¶<br><br>â€¶That'll do.â€¶ Rod was in fact getting hungry.<br><br>â€¶And we sounded a bell just before it was served. You would eventually react like Pavlov's dog did, salivating, or maybe your nostrils flaring, just at the sound of the bell. You would say to yourself, â€˜this is silly', but the bell would still sound and your nostrils would still flare.â€¶<br><br>Rod thought for a moment. â€¶I think this, at least, we can tell to Tami.â€¶<br><br>â€¶True,â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal said readily. â€¶From this point on, I want you to explain to Tami everything we are about to discuss. If she wonders why we called you here alone, tell her it would be awkward and perhaps impolite to discuss conditioning her with her sitting there.â€¶ He pointed to another chair next to them. Rod pictured Tami's nakedness sitting on that chair, her bare butt on the cushion, a contrast to their full sets of clothes, her bare toes maybe idly grabbing the coffee table. He thought of her reaching over with her toes and caressing his dick through his pants. This got him hard and then he had to shift in his chair.<br><br>He sensed they were finally getting somewhere and was eager to learn more. With a touch of raillery he said, â€¶What's the plan, gentlemen?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Break the connection,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said. â€¶Get her to associate clothing with pleasure. Put clothes on her while she is experiencing orgasm.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Sounds straightforward enough.â€¶<br><br>â€¶It's not a sure thing. There might be an unexpected interaction with some deeper psychodynamic which would even make the allergy worse. Also, even if, as we expect, it is straightforward, it will not be easy, because both elements of the association are extremely strong. Tami's nakedness has been utter â€” possibly nobody in the history of the human race has been so naked for so long, in relation to the person's surroundings, a nude in the middle of a world of the clothed, often HEAVILY clothed, as when she walks barefoot and naked through snow in the middle of the campus. And Tami's orgasmic pleasure has been so great as to be perhaps unique. It is off the scale.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal got up to his desk and came back with an oversize leaflet which he handed to Dr. Kantor.<br><br>â€¶As you know, when we discovered that Tami's consent to the experiments in Lab 6 had not been properly obtained, we destroyed all the records we had made of those experiments. This included brain wave studies done during her stages of arousal and climax. To emphasize our contriteness we gave the floppy disks to Tami personally â€” we were still using floppies at the time â€” and she did the erasing herself, in this very room.â€¶ Rod looked over at the computer next to the desk. â€¶But one record of her responses does survive: the replication experiment she volunteered to do when she heard our accreditation was in danger.â€¶<br><br>Rod remembered that, the airplane trip to Chicago, the brightly lit stage with the dildos, Tami heaving into ten orgasms surrounded by the rows of professors taking notes, during the climactic moments looking up at him for support with mixed feelings of love and shame.<br><br>As Dr. Kantor opened the loose leaf, Rod said, â€¶You folks owe Tami a hell of a lot of thanks.â€¶<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal said, â€¶It is not an overstatement, Mr. Sykes, to say that we would sacrifice our professional reputations for her if required.â€¶<br><br>â€¶See this chart,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said. â€¶These are Tami's delta waves at plateau, orgasm, plateau again, orgasm againâ€¦ Delta waves are â€˜pleasure waves', as has been shown in a variety of contexts.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Like when eating chocolate?â€¶<br><br>Rod meant this as a little joke but Dr. Kantor said, with a straight face, â€¶Actually yes. Chocolate studies have been doneâ€¦ During this plateau/orgasm series here, see how the delta waves were particularly prominent. This was during â€“â€¶ he pointed to another squiggly line in the chart, lower down, â€¶a certain type of clitoral and Graffenberg spot stimulation.â€¶<br><br>â€¶It would probably be more effective, from a brute force standpoint, to work on the â€˜pain' end of the association, giving her electrical shocks when naked and stopping them as she puts on an article of clothing. But that would be inhumane and besides, we want to her to be free to be naked when she wants. We propose instead to work on the â€˜pleasure' end of the association. If clothing could be introduced exactly during that time, perhaps just a small article at first, then taken away as stimulation ceased, then introduced again â€” â€¶<br><br>Rod suddenly sat up. â€¶You're not suggesting strapping her into that â€” Lab 6 â€” thing â€“â€¶<br><br>â€¶We would hate to do that,â€¶ Dr. Abu Jamal said. â€¶Lab 6 has been boarded up for three years. The equipment has been disassembled but is still there. It probably is not a good idea anyway because in Tami's mind the equipment has a bad association of its own. But it occurred to us that such a mechanical process, the thrusting of dildos into Tami's vagina and rectum, and the suctioning of her nipples, is too crude for the split-second timing and delicate manipulation of her genitals that would be required.â€¶<br><br>Rod swallowed and said, â€¶I willâ€¦ perform with her if that's what's needed.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Actually, more than one set of tongues and fingers will probably be required. Tongues and fingers that are intimately familiar with every nuance of Tami's reactionsâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“<br><br>By the time Rod came home it was almost ten o'clock. He was really hungry now and hoped there was enough in the refrigerator to put together a sandwich. Also he needed a full stomach to think about the mouthful Drs. Abu Jamal and Kantor had said at Chalfont and think about what to tell Tami.<br><br>He came in to the kitchen and Tami was at the table, sitting at it instead of on top, dawdling over a cup of tea. When she saw him she came up and hugged him. She seemed sad. They separated and she held his hands in front of her. Then she brought her limber leg up and placed her foot on top, grasping over his hand with her flexible toes.<br><br>Rod looked down and playfully and made the standard chimpanzee sound when Tami used her feet like hands. â€¶Ooo ooo ooo.â€¶<br><br>Tami smiled wanly and looked down at her toes. Rod gave her toes a closer look and his eyes widened.<br><br>On her third toe, where the wedding band used to be, was a tattoo!<br><br>It was exquisitely made, evidently done at that place in town. It was in the shape of a ring, taking up the area formerly hidden by the band. In spiderly but flowing words it read across her toe, â€¶I belong to Rod,â€¶ with a heart.<br><br>Rod tried to form words but couldn't. Getting a tattoo, marring her perfect nudity, was always one thing Tami was against. As was he.<br><br>â€¶I just had to, Baby,â€¶ she confessed through moist eyes. â€¶I want the world to know I'm married to you but I can't wear that ring even for one minute now. It burns like fire. And I can't wear a ring on my finger either. Not even a little necklace. Baby, I don't know what's happening to me!!â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 52", content: "Snow.<br><br>On the morning of April 4, Tami and Rod woke up at the same time, Tami on the hardwood floor, Rod on the bed. Though it was before sunrise the bedroom was bright and silent. They knew what it meant. Wordlessly they padded to the bay window and saw the white mounds and valleys, the fluffy white cotton balls encoating the recently sprung buds on the shrubbery, luminous in the predawn light.<br><br>The April blizzard, a yearly tradition up here in the Vermont north country.<br><br>As Rod watched, Tami slid open the glass door and stepped out, her bare feet silently and effortlessly fluffing through the soft white stuff. Rod crossed his arms, shivering in his pajamas, as his wife strolled nakedly and languidly through the drifts, at one point up to her thighs, as relaxed as if she were sauntering along a warm beach. Then she sat down in the luminous snow. Tami had no fear of being naked in the snow, she knew that it was harmless for short periods, plus she had built up a resistance to the cold far greater than a normal person's. Still, Rod cringed as he imagined the tiny flakes pressing up into her pussy and her little brown-skinned sphincter.<br><br>Now she lay back, and stretched herself out into an â€˜X'. She seemed in position to make one of her â€˜snow angels' but for her mood. The snow was so deep that he could only see the tips of her breasts, disembodied nipples poking out from behind the drifts.<br><br>Tami had gotten to love playing in the snow. She was a great one at throwing snowballs at friends on campus, a long left-handed sidearm delivery that would reach a surprised Trent or Gretchen from halfway across the quad, before laughingly running away from any counterattack, her toes kicking up bits of white behind her. Or spending half an hour hefting rolled-up white boulders across the field in front of the art building, painstakingly building a snowwoman (always a female, with breasts and a â€¶Vâ€¶ below) while half the campus walked by.<br><br>But now she seemed almost like she was lying down in the snow to die. It was very unsettling.<br><br>She had been depressed since he came back last night and showed him the tattoo on her toe. Giving her the Chalfont doctors' explanation for her allergy improved her mood a little, but just a little. She must have been aware of the advance in her allergy over the past few months, and it was touching that it began to concern her only when it meant she could no longer wear her wedding ring. But she had gotten to love being naked and the prospect of a program to get her back into clothes did not seem to excite her much.<br><br>Maybe she sensed that the doctors had told more to Rod than he let on. A couple of months ago she said they were holding back on her. Maybe she was still sensing that. Hence the lack of any relief as to a theory of her allergy finally being disclosed.<br><br>Rod was so lost in his thoughts that it gave him a start to see Tami rise out of the snow, like a corpse coming to life. The sun was rising and the pale light graced her bare shoulder and hip as she approached. Her head down, she padded back to him, then hugged him, the snow on her bare skin chilling him as it melted through his pajamas. Then she knelt down and without closing the sliding glass door behind her, took his limp dick out of his bottoms and started sucking him.<br><br>He wanted to tell her to stop, she was doing it so joylessly. But her technique was so good, and it occurred to him that she was sucking him as therapy for herself as well as for his pleasure. Maybe as a kind of recompense for not being able to wear the ring that bound her to him. Though of course that was not fair. The tattoo around her toe was far more permanent that any ring that one could slip off.<br><br>Rod looked up at the snowy back yard, the trail incongruously made by bare feet, breathed in the cold air, looked down past his wife's head at the bits of snow stuck to her bare butt cheeks, and rose up and deposited a full load of semen down Tami's throat. She gulped it down to the last drop and kept sucking until the last, weak spasms, then took his softening, floppy dick out and kissed it. She got up and hugged him again and he felt about to cry.<br><br>He followed her as she went to the kitchen. Even though it was morning, she popped open a can of Naragansett, the cheap beer she knew from Providence that for some reason one could buy at the supermarket up here in Campbell County, Vermont. She sat in her usual cross-legged position on top of the table as she sipped it.<br><br>â€¶I can't lie to you, Baby,â€¶ Tami said, looking down at her nipples, wet with the melted bits of snow, â€¶I have a feeling something bad is about to happen. I can feel it in my nips.â€¶<br><br>She could pick up barometric pressure with her nipples, it had long been clear. And could sometimes pick up other people's thoughts with them. But foretelling the future was a new ability.<br><br>â€¶Like what?â€¶ he felt compelled to ask.<br><br>â€¶I don't know.â€¶ Another sip. â€¶I don't feel well. I think I'll call in sick today.â€¶<br><br>Tami had always been driven by a work ethic and the need to impress. Kind of like he was, though with him it was the words his parents had brought him up with, the words of Martin Luther King, Jr. â€” â€¶burn the midnight oilâ€¶, â€¶I hate being even one minute lateâ€¶. With Tami, he took it as an expression of Catholic guilt, original sin. So this calling in sick was unusual. He felt like she wanted to be alone for a while. So after sitting around a few moments, he got showered and dressed and went to work.<br><br>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“<br><br>The return of snow brought the return of Yvette, once again having broken up with Pierre, once again dancing at Teaser's and calling up Tami's house, this time without getting into trouble and leaving it for Luci the manager to call.<br><br>â€¶Um, OK/. Sure,â€¶ Tami said. It was after supper and she and Rod were sitting around glumly watching T.V., almost as if waiting for the bad thing that Tami had predicted to happen.<br><br>Yvette needed a place to crash tonight but was not in crisis. She simply needed time for a callback from a friend in Montreal she could stay with. Now that she was in that kitchen again, the kitchen she had such fond memories of, she felt a little guilty, like she was intruding. There was no atmosphere of gaiety. Tami the Naked Girl, the girl who was allergic to clothes, seemed preoccupied, depressed. Even her big brown nipples seemed to droop down a little, not stiff and perky as usual.<br><br>Fortunately Tami's coffee was as terrible as before.<br><br>â€¶Oh, sorry,â€¶ Yvette said, as she coughed upon the first sip of the bitter, grounds-filled fluid and spilled it across the table.<br><br>Tami looked at her for a moment and then giggled. It was good to see. She reached over with a napkin and cleaned up the spill, her breasts jiggling and dancing as they pointed downward.<br><br>After she was done Tami said, â€¶You look better than last time.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Much. Partly because of you. Merci. My dancing is better now too. I think I like it.â€¶<br><br>Tami began to roll her eyes but then corrected herself. â€¶OK.<br><br>â€¶Want to see my new costume?â€¶<br><br>Tami hesitated but then said, â€¶Sure.â€¶ Yvette found herself back in that bathroom, with the big enema bag near the toilet, and remembered her first conclusions as to how weird this naked girl was, the enema bag, the smell of vomit that she attributed to Tami being bulimic but later realized had been her own, seeing the naked white girl in a kitchen full of black people.<br><br>In a moment she was out in the kitchen, proudly showing off what she wore at the beginning of each set. A lacy black bikini top, a black g-string with feathers that stuck out from the waistband, and over it, a sheer red baby-doll cape. On her sock-ess feet were high heels with clear glass soles. Yes, a typical outfit for a topless dancer, but she liked to think of it as a bit classier than the usual.<br><br>As Yvette stood there, tottering on the high heels, hands on her hips, her 32B breasts stuck out just so, Tami applauded. And then, her expression getting more serious, looked Yvette up and down and walked around her, eyeing her from every angle. It was a little disconcerting. At first she thought Tami was getting turned on. Some of the other dancers had made lesbian advances and she still didn't know how to deal with it. She didn't dare tell Pierre â€” having a threesome was one of his announced fantasies and if he got wind of it, well he could be quite overbearing when he wanted something, especially something sexual. It still hurt a little when she swallowed, from that time he forced his dick into her mouth.<br><br>But then it seemed like Tami's interest was more clinical, like a doctor doing an exam. And it was odd being in this skimpy outfit and yet feeling so dressed next to Tami's utter nakedness. She looked down and saw Tami's strong, tanned bare feet next to her pale white toes strapped into the high glass heels. And looked sideways at Tami's plum-colored pussy hair next to her g-string with the feathers and the baby doll over it. Even at Teaser's you weren't allowed to take off your bottom, though some of the girls cheated in the lap dance booths. Yet Tami went around bottomless all the time, in public no less.<br><br>Tami touched the feathers and said, â€¶If you don't mind,â€¶ and cinched about an inch of the waist band between two fingers. â€¶Does this fit better?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Why, yes.â€¶ The g-string was a little awkward. She thought that was to be expected. But with it taken in like that, it fit her like a second skin.<br><br>â€¶I think the bra could use more room in the cups, and a smaller band.â€¶ She let Tami's fingers gently tug at the lace so that her breasts jiggled a bit.<br><br>â€¶Oh that's a shame, this cost a hundred dollars.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What! Ohâ€¦ a hundred Canadian?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oui.â€¶<br><br>â€¶You don't have to buy another. This can be altered. Look, why don't you let me do it? I can do it tomorrow. You can stay another day.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Merci. Thank you.â€¶<br><br>Tami looked up at the clock. It was seven and getting dark.<br><br>â€¶Cold outside,â€¶ Yvette said. As if Tami wouldn't know.<br><br>Tami looked down at her nipples. â€¶Yes, it's going to be clear and cold the next few days. Below freezing.â€¶ She looked at Yvette with a smile. â€¶I bet Homer's flooded the rink. Want to go skating?â€¶<br><br>â€¶What? Skating?â€¶ She looked down at her glass heels, then at her boots that she had taken off in the hall, then at Tami's bare feet, then up at the rest of Tami's bare body. â€¶I'm not sureâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶You're Canadian, for goodness sake. You MUST know how to skate!â€¶<br><br>â€¶Wellâ€¦â€¶ She had skated as a kid but it had been a long time.<br><br>â€¶C'mon, you can rent skates there. I'll get mine. Get dressed. Let's go!â€¶<br><br>A few minutes later, she watched Tami fling what looked like a little sandal bag into the back seat and cringed as she saw the bare buns settle onto the freezing vinyl of the front seat of the Volkswagen. They were headed into town. Just like before, only now it was nighttime. She remembered that bright snowy morning, walking with this naked girl down the main street, the naked girl who proudly showed her newly pedicured toes to that old lady and her professor friend, spreading them as they sparkled, encrusted with snow, in the bright morning sunshine, then opening her pussy lips and making her little thing jump in the cold winter air as everyone watched. Weird, but happy. A happy woman, this Tami was. She wondered why she had seemed so depressed a while ago.<br><br>As the outdoor rink came into view, all lit up with lights strung around it and a crowd of skaters circling round and round, Tami said, â€¶Yvette, I'm glad you came!â€¶ Yvette smiled, feeling good about herself. Tami was like that. She made you feel good about yourself.<br><br>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“<br><br>The roads were horrible up in the mountains so it took Rod a long time to get home. By the time he dragged himself into the kitchen his eyes were so tired from peering through that salt-sprayed windshield that he had to get to sleep right away. He only barely read the note from Tami on the table, saying she was going skating with Yvette. Yvette? Was she back? Another Tami project, rescuing wayward strippers. As if just being a stripper wasn't wayward enough. At least it looked like Tami had gotten out of her funk. With hardly another thought he stripped off as much of his clothes as he had energy for and hit the bed face-down.<br><br>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“<br><br>They were in between songs in the big practice room and Sarge, up on his stool, looking down at his stand, itched behind his ear with his baton as he read from the papers in front of him. Rod sat in the trombone section, looking across the sea of black faces and the occasional white one, especially Brigid in the clarinet section, trying to catch her eye. She was very fetching today, no jean jacket, but a purple sweater over a white collared shirt. Some girls looked good no matter what they wore. The strands of Brigid's red hair, long and loose, played over the shoulders of the fluffy sweater.<br><br>Alas, Brigid wasn't looking at him. Her attention was fixed on Sarge as he went over the new invitation. â€¶Now, this is a big step for us, the Winter Carnival at Killington. We've never been at an event like that before. We'll be doing straight marching, but the affair is kind of, how shall I say it, glitzy. You notice the uniforms are gone,â€¶ he said, motioning to the empty coat racks around the perimeter of the room. â€¶Some shiny piping is being put in. But we won't be doing any different moves, just what we did basically at the Patriots pregame in Foxboro.<br><br>â€¶Now, this is at night, the middle of winter, up in Vermont. It will be cold. The thermal underwear that some of you were wearing in Foxboro, well some of it was too bulky. A couple of you looked like you were about to explode.â€¶ There was some laughter; everyone knew exactly the kids he was talking about. â€¶So the school has decided to spring for streamlined thermals, made especially for marching bands. We have to get the orders in right away. Let me know now. Who is going to be wearing thermals?â€¶<br><br>He looked up and saw almost everyone raising their hands. He counted. Now Brigid's hand slowly rose to join the others. Sarge laughed. â€¶Not you!!â€¶, and good-naturedly waved her hand down with his baton. Brigid put her hand on her lap and stuck out her lower lip in an exaggerated pout.<br><br>After he had taken the count, Sarge said, â€¶OK, enough talk. Let's get to â€˜National Emblem'.â€¶ He raised his baton and waited for the shuffling of sheet music until everyone was ready.<br><br>His baton still up, Sarge covered his eyes and said, â€¶Sorry, I just had a vision of our band being led by a majorette in long johns.â€¶ He shook the thought out of his head as some of the kids laughed. Then he looked at Brigid. â€¶Don't worry, it won't be a long march. And not like that last game. No standing still in the freezing rain while some old guy gives an endless speech.â€¶<br><br>Brigid, remembering, momentarily dropped the clarinet from her mouth to say, â€¶Zhhhh!â€¶ and shudder. Debra and Virginia and some of her other girlfriends giggled in sympathy.<br><br>Baton still up, Sarge said, â€¶By the way, we'll be marching on packed snow, so the majorette's footwear is being revised to be more secure. Also, some other uniform changes.â€¶<br><br>Tentatively, Brigid said, â€¶Like what?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Well I understand they're doing away with the circlets. Okay, let's go!â€¶<br><br>His baton went down for the first beat.<br><br>â€¶Thhhhbbbvvvvssshhhzzz!!!â€¶<br><br>It was a spectacular flub, from the suddenly dry lips of the trombone section.<br><br>The room burst out with laughter as if it had been the world's loudest fart.<br><br>â€¶Goodness that was horrible,â€¶ Sarge said, cutting off the tune. â€¶Let's try again.â€¶ He raised his baton. â€¶Let's go!â€¶" },
      { title: "Chapter 53", content: "Once again, Acting Dean Anthony Noyes looked out the big bay window of his ninth-floor office, this time onto a campus white with the aftermath of the annual April blizzard, and once again beheld Tami Smithers, the all but certain valedictorian, this time hanging from a bare tree whose branches were thick with white. Her legs crooked back over the branch, red toes wiggling, she was conversing with some friends who were standing around, apparently in the process of climbing down when they arrived. Her short plum-colored hair hung down a bit, her face a little flushed as one would expect. Her breasts, tight and hard as always, tended ever so slightly downward in their upside down position. Her arms hung down to the ground, fingers playing in the snow. In her stretched out position one could see her firm, concave tummy, the secret envy of every woman on campus.<br><br>Presently she flipped her feet forward and somersaulted onto the ground, snow up to her ankles, with the nonchalance of a trained gymnast. Now, bookbag slung over her bare shoulder, casually skiffing the snow ahead of her with her toes, she continued chatting with them as they made their way down the concourse.<br><br>It was poetry in motion, the beauty of the feminine form at its utmost, the true essence of femininity, the spirit expressed in flesh, that had inspired DaVinci, Velasquez, Renoirâ€¦<br><br>â€¶Look at those titties! Lord Almighty!â€¶<br><br>Noyes closed his eyes in quiet toleration as he heard the not-unexpected babblings of the college lawyer.<br><br>The â€¶newâ€¶ college lawyer, that is. After the departure of Henry Ross the Hiring Committee, shell-shocked by the revelations, had overreacted. They hired an old friend of Professor Emeritus Jan Latimer, one George Halifax, who was to Henry Ross as matter is to anti-matter. Or maybe the other way around. They wanted to turn the page on Henry Ross, secretive, wiry and thin, always impeccably dressed, with a background as a prosecutor, and a maze of complicated and, it turned out, evil thoughts behind his Sphinx-like face.<br><br>George Halifax was grossly overweight, and was always stuffing himself with pretzels or potato chips, many of which could be found between the couch cushions in his cluttered, disgusting office. His tie always rebelled at staying tied around his bulging neck, his shirt at staying tucked. He babbled constantly and sometimes incoherently at anything that might cross his mind, usually not touching anywhere near his legal experience, which had been mostly in entertainment law.<br><br>He also talked very often and very fondly about his wife Ethelinda, whom Noyes had met at a luncheon once, as she and George crowded everyone out from the buffet table. Ethelinda weighed only slightly less than George. Try as he might, Noyes could not help contemplating the logistics involved in their sex life, which George referred to often, and which, Noyes concluded, must require some kind of winch-like device.<br><br>â€¶Man, those nips must be rock hard in that cold! What a super woman! Isn't she a babe? You got to admit â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, she is attractive, George,â€¶ Noyes said limply, trying to shut him up. What could he do? George Halifax had one thing in common with Ross, and that was that knowing what he did about the Tami Smithers affair, he was basically unsackable. And he had a good heart (being the Anti-Ross) and seemed to know enough about the law to â€” well, as Noyes said to Professor Girardo at a faculty party, â€¶He'll do for now.â€¶<br><br>Halifax popped a pretzel into his mouth (he had a batch in his jacket pocket) and munched as he watched Tami as intently as if he were 18 again and watching a peep show in Times Square.<br><br>â€¶Now George â€” â€¶<br><br>â€¶Really a super woman,â€¶ Halifax continued. â€¶Popping off 136 times in a row! Can you imagine that? I know it wasn't her idea, but even now, I bet she could rattle off a few dozen between classes, with the help of her army of pussy lickers. Girls just have it all over us guys. Me, my record is three, and that took all night. E (his shorthand for Ethelinda) tried and tried to get another but I was limp as a wet noodle and half dead.â€¶<br><br>Again, Noyes thought of winches. He tried once again to interrupt these observations, the likes of which Halifax had made many times. â€¶George!â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?â€¶<br><br>â€¶George, we have to talk about this new development.â€¶<br><br>â€¶What?â€¶ Halifax spat out a speck of pretzel as he spoke, his eyes still glued on Tami.<br><br>â€¶The unfortunate news about her brother.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, man,â€¶ Halifax said, wiping the pretzel flecks of his jacket as some hit Noyes â€” â€¶sorryâ€¶ â€” then he observed, â€¶That's rough, ain't it. What a dry socket that hellhole is. What a monumental f***up! And most of the world saw it coming!â€¶<br><br>Noyes nodded.<br><br>Halifax continued, â€¶At least he's not a casualty.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, thank God for that.â€¶ Noyes looked out over the horizon. â€¶Almost four thousand dead, fortunately not yet including Joseph Smithers, age 20.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Not so fortunate for the four thousandâ€¦ This will be a big blow to her.â€¶ Halifax made a futile effort to straighten his tie, something he did automatically about 500 times a day.<br><br>Noyes quickly reviewed, â€¶He was supposed to return in May, to help with the father's hardware store, which is struggling. The father's health isn't too good either.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Yes, he drinks a lot of beer, probably in heart attack country,â€¶ Halifax said, without irony.<br><br>â€¶So what can be done?â€¶ Noyes said.<br><br>â€¶I looked into it like you said. Not a good idea to make this known before the news is officially out. But then we can send a signal to the International.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Is that all? Can't we get her home before the semester ends? Give her her degree early?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Don't you think that would raise eyebrows? I mean, be honest.â€¶<br><br>Halifax was right. Noyes had been thinking of how to avoid the commencement, only six weeks away, with the very naked Tami Smithers on view for the local cameras and, horror of horrors, finally attracting the national press. The local press had been tactful, but the national press was full of vicious armchair masturbatorsâ€¦ The name of Campbell â€“ Frank would be synonymous with â€¶radical nudist collegeâ€¶â€¦<br><br>But, George was right, trying to avoid the commencement situation was probably impossible. So maybe angling to get Ms. Smithers a (bare) leg up on the International was the best hope.<br><br>Consuming another pretzel, which was his idea of a diet (his usual pocket-stuffer was cookies), Halifax said, â€¶It's safe to talk to Girardo about amending her application.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh, good. That's very good.â€¶ Somehow Halifax had gotten Professor Albert Girardo, Chair of the Fashion Technology Department, to play ball. Which Noyes had never been able to do. Give Halifax that much, he could be a successful schmoozer. Maybe because he was so honest about his intentions. Another stereotype about lawyers, shattered.<br><br>â€¶Should we do it on our own?â€¶ Noyes said. The application had a separate section to be filled out by the sponsoring institution, which the candidate did not see. They could put the words of Tami's family hardship there.<br><br>â€¶Yes, from what we know of her, she won't want any special consideration.â€¶ Munch, munch, swallow. â€¶Best keep it secret from her.â€¶<br><br>Noyes shook his head. â€¶She might need such special consideration, with those weird designs of hers.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Albert said something which I think is right. She's been naked so long, she probably forgot what clothes feel like. I hear she doesn't even think of herself as starkers. She thinks her pussy hair and her head hair is her clothes.â€¶<br><br>Noyes winced at the language. Despite all he had been forced to witness the past three years, he was still a churchgoer. Not like Halifax, who bolted from the Catholic Church years ago.<br><br>â€¶When she gets back into clothes, it'll be a shock.â€¶<br><br>â€¶You think so?â€¶<br><br>â€¶I KNOW so.â€¶ Another pretzel. â€¶The Chalfont people figured that out a while ago. The deal is, she gets her rocks off so much while naked, her body now thinks that clothes mean pain. This week they've finally started a program to desensitize her.â€¶<br><br>Noyes's eyes widened. For a long time Abu Jamal had refused to tell him what was going on over there. â€¶Why didn't you tell me that?â€¶<br><br>Halifax shrugged, causing the tail of his shirt to finally pop out. â€¶You never asked me. Uh oh, here she comes.â€¶<br><br>Tami, having taken leave of her friends, was heading toward the administration building. Whatever reason Tami had to come to them, they dreaded having to face her, while keeping secret the bad news about her brother. It was impossible to lie to Tami Smithers. Even keeping something unsaid would be detected somehow, through those extra-sensory nipples.<br><br>Noyes and Halifax both exhaled as Tami turned to the right. Evidently she was going to the fashion building. And now a big soft snowball planted itself squarely into the bush of her plum-colored pubic hair. She dropped her bookbag and ran for revenge, her bare feet knifing through the snow, no doubt soon to overtake her booted and heavily clothed assailant as they both ran out of view.<br><br>â€¶The kid in clothes doesn't stand a chance,â€¶ Halifax observed. The two older men were about to turn away from the window when Tami re-entered their view, her flushed-skin nakedness prone and wrapped over the shoulder of a tall athletic hispanic girl, preceded by two other girls who carried one bare foot over their own shoulders. Tami's bare butt cheeks, wet with melted snow, glistened in the sunlight. It was like barbarians hauling off precious pillage after a raid, and their captive did shout and beat her fists against the hispanic girl's back, though her distress was only playful. They carried their naked captive out of sight, to a place unknown.<br><br>â€¶There they go again,â€¶ Halifax said, munching another pretzel. â€¶What a sight. This is better than all that intense, graphic pornography. I tell ya Tony, I love this job!â€¶<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Tahir Abu Jamal, M.D., Director of the Chalfont Institute, checked the attendance list for the meeting, a meeting for which he was late, which was kind of rude. Ms. Smithers and her six friends, who would help with her desensitization to clothes. Irregular, obscene in a way, but he agreed with Kantor, who was right behind him. Really, from a humane point of view, the best way to do it. Ms. Smithers' allergy was formed in the most invasive situation possible, a place of cold pistons and suction cups, surrounded by unfeeling, if not outright sadistic, strangers, older men. It should be undone in an atmosphere of friendship and love.<br><br>They hurried down the hall to Lab 4, which consisted of chemistry tables surrounded by high lab chairs, used in the old days for recombinant research. In these days of computer models, actual lab work was almost a thing of the past. He and Kantor opened the door and looked up â€”<br><br>â€¶OHHâ€¦ Ohhhâ€¦ h â€“ helloâ€¦ d â€“ d â€“ doctorâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Ms. Smithers was up on the nearest table on all fours, facing the two doctors who stood dumbstruck not three feet in front of her gasping face. Her nakedness was being attacked from every quarter. One of the undergraduate girls had her head resting on the table, facing up to suck on one nipple while her hand twisted and rubbed and stretched the other. The nipples could withstand such treatment, big and brown and permanently erect, having been mercilessly bristled and suctioned in this very buildingâ€¦ Another TL reaching over with a finger in her crotch. Two others were seated behind her, each holding an upturned foot in her hand as she sucked on the toes. Another, standing up, was running her tongue over the lithe, muscular bare shoulders. Most jarringly, the sixth young woman was standing behind the table, separating the buttocks with her hands, while her tongue was noodling deep into Ms. Smithers's anus.<br><br>He had been expecting a seated audience, waiting for his presentation. He blinked and returned to eye contact with Ms. Smithers. Everyone was, of course, very familiar with her facial expressions while sexually aroused, and it was clear that she was approaching a climax, perhaps not for the first time.<br><br>â€¶Y â€“ yessâ€¦ d â€“ doctorrr â€” OHH! OHH! H â€“ how are yyyou â€” OHH! T â€“ todayyyy â€” EEEE!!â€¶<br><br>As her eyes popped open her body bucked like a bronco as her six friends held onto her, not allowing their ministrations to be detached for even one second.<br><br>He cleared his throat and decided to say what he had to say. He had heard that Ms. Smithers did not like for proceedings to be interrupted while her friends were licking her. From what he understood, it was an unspoken contest. As their knowledge of her body increased, they were determined to bring her to ever more intense orgasms, while she augmented her self-control by the same amount.<br><br>â€¶Ms. Smithers, ladies,â€¶ he said, briefly looking over to the quite preoccupied friends, â€¶you have been given a rough idea of this project. Thank you for donating your time.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Ohhhhâ€¦ ohhhhâ€¦â€¶ As Tami's moans subsided into ragged breathing one became aware of the sounds of the TL's, breathing heavily and sucking and licking. The woman with her tongue in Tami's rectum, who was facing him across the top of the bare back, looked up him impassively, but the others did not seem to acknowledge his existence.<br><br>â€¶After much study it appears that Tami's body hasâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Tami kept her eyes focused on him to the extent she could, though her twitching eyebrows betrayed the continued stimulation on all her sensitive areas. But her friends appeared to be trained on her body, not on his words. Finally he put his foot down.<br><br>â€¶Ladies, I think you shouldâ€¦ sit and give me your undivided attention. Please.â€¶<br><br>So intent were they on extracting another orgasm that Tami had to shake them off, like a dog shaking off rain. With obvious disappointment the six clothed young women wiped their mouths and arranged themselves on the chairs. The naked girl stayed on the table, and sat cross-legged. Tami was still catching her breath, her breasts heaving, her tummy expanding and contracting. The TL's were, also, catching their breath.<br><br>Dr. Abu Jamal and Dr. Kantor pulled up a couple of chairs and sat down. After allowing silence to sink in, the Chalfont Director spoke.<br><br>â€¶Tami wants to wear clothes.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Awwwwâ€¦ â€¶ The expression of disappointment and pouting lips from the TL's was playful but also heartfelt. They wanted Tami to be always naked so the sight of her beauty would never be denied them. But they knew it would be a disservice to Tami for her allergy to continue, especially with her about to graduate.<br><br>â€¶Her body has associated nakedness with pleasure. Somehow, it has formed a contrapositive reaction, associating clothes with pain. We are here to undo that association. Now I have some brief handouts here for you to readâ€¦â€¶<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The big atrium of the rec hall was permeated with the smell of sweat, which of course was not unusual. Only at the moment it was just one person's sweat. Mixed with the smell of female sexual arousal.<br><br>It was a crowd by any definition, dozens of students in rec room attire (T-shirts, shorts, sneakers and socks), looking up at the â€¶Hamster Wheelâ€¶, the double treadmill, and the naked laboring body up on it, Tami with her bare feet pressing down on the blades, one foot after the other, the toes curling over the edges.<br><br>Arms pressing up againt the overhead bars, her perfectly toned, tanned body was dripping with sweat. Sweat ran down her face, coated her arms and shoulders, dripped off her breasts, ran down her concave tummy into the wet plum-colored forest at her crotch, down her widely-spread legs. Her eyes were closed as she concentrated intensely. Her heavy breaths were the only sound as everyone stood there enraptured.<br><br>Her pussy lips, slightly opened, glistened in the harsh lighting. The young men watching felt their dicks stiffen and were grateful for jockstraps and long shorts that hid their arousal. Dr. Kantor, off to the side, standing with his clipboard.<br><br>Now, Spica, who had plenty of room to stand below Tami's slightly spread pussy lips, carefully raised the dildo up, up, closerâ€¦ as Rosaria, on a stepladder to the side, carefully encircled a string around Tami's waist, closing in, inâ€¦" },
      { title: "Chapter 54", content: "â€¶Good afternoon, Ms. Smithers,â€¶ Dr. Kantor said, turning on the harsh overhead hanglight in the freezing, abandoned lab.<br><br>The naked girl, splayed out on the black granite table, opened her eyes and raised her head, eyes blinking in the sudden light. She was surrounded by her friends, in gloves and overcoats. The doctor was right in front of her, she could see his face through the forest of pubic hair at the junction of her widely spread legs. Being Tami Smithers, having gone naked for years, she felt no need to close them as she responded, her breath making little clouds in the still, sepulchral cold. There was an element of shivering, from the cold and also from sexual deprivation. â€¶I'm r â€“ readyâ€¦ zhhhhâ€¦â€¶<br><br>Here in Lab 1, a cavernous subterranean space abandoned since 1955, the team went to work.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, what seemed like agonizing stasis was actually an approach to climax. The naked girl's body writhed in frustration as her body was gently, and inadequately, stimulated by the six TL's, none of whom had taken off their coats or gloves. Spica and Myra lightly licked the brown, hard nipples that reached up in vain for greater stimulation than was offered. The rough fabric of Melissa's gloved hand scraped along the concave tummy and along the arms. Rosaria blew on the red, engorged clit, almost steaming in the cold air, and licked along the inner thighs, but never actually touched the clit or the pussy lips. She had to raise her head to avoid the straining pelvis as it lurched up with a groan from its owner; she simply pushed the thighs down with her powerful arms and began the licking and blowing again. Barbara and Jeane, their noses red with the cold, were holding the feet, licking and sucking on the toughened toes. The shadows of the TL's, harsh in the overhead light, lurched and receded across the landscape of the always naked Tami, her butt and her heels scraping against the rough granite as she writhed and moaned.<br><br>Dr. Kantor stood to the side with his clipboard, his thoughts and desires hidden. Now he called Barbara away from her station. Barbara pulled a flip-flop from her coat pocket. A single, solitary flip-flop, the merest possible covering for the foot, and drew it closer to the straining toes of the totally naked young woman, closer, closerâ€¦<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rod sat alone, having finished his makeshift supper, after another long day at the project. Another afternoon of military maneuvers. More people not showing up, the ranks always thinning.<br><br>He was worried about Tami, even though she seemed a little better the past couple of days. He had assumed that Yvette would be nothing but trouble, but going to the skating rink with her seemed to cheer her up. He wished he could have been there. He wanted to see Tami happy. Yet he could not get out of his mind what she had said that strange day when she drank beer and stayed home, about getting the feeling that bad things were about to happen.<br><br>And he was worried about her â€¶rehabilitationâ€¶ at Chalfont. He couldn't imagine Tami in clothes. He knew she had been a normal clothed freshman her first week, so long ago, but he hadn't remembered her then. Like everyone else, he had only noticed her after she had been stripped. Thank goodness that first encounter in the dorm lounge had worked out well, when he had sat in front of her and Jen and ended up convincing her to run for dorm rep. Of course, what he took for normal freshman shyness was actually a deep, cringing shame at being naked in publicâ€¦ And then that even bigger risk, inviting her to the Black Formal. He was always thankful to Jen for convincing her it was O.K. to go.<br><br>So Tami wearing clothes? Even the idea seemed strange. He had seen her playing on the computer, putting her head onto the clothed bodies of other women, and it always looked fake.<br><br>He hoped it would work out. She had finally gotten motivated, having been freaked out by not being able to wear her wedding ring and having that blue ring tattooed onto her toe. He had been told that the TL's would be helping out, and it was just as well that he not be involved. He wouldn't feel comfortable licking Tami with people watching.<br><br>Now as it was getting dark he heard the slopping of bare feet in the slush outside, then the rubbing of tough soles on the doormat.<br><br>She surprised him by flinging the door open and bursting in with a loud â€¶HI!â€¶ Then she stood there smiling broadly, her hand placed on a saucily jutted out hip. â€¶What do you think?â€¶<br><br>â€¶About what, Babe?â€¶<br><br>She waited a few beats and then â€” â€¶MY OUTFIT!â€¶<br><br>Her shout made him jump. â€¶W â€“ what?â€¶<br><br>â€¶MY CLOTHES!!â€¶<br><br>He looked her up and down. Aside from the tattoo on her toe there seemed nothing to mar her perfect and total nudity. But now she swung her hips from side to side. Then she raised her leg way up, and gripped the counter with her toes.<br><br>He peered carefully and saw some kind of orange sliver between her pussy lips. â€¶What is that? Polyester?â€¶<br><br>She beamed with pride as she pulled her lower lips apart. â€¶The fabric isn't the best, yet. I call it a C-string. It came to me in a dream a long time ago. I was sitting on a beach in California and these Mexican girls were wearing thongs andâ€¦ well it's a long story. But I got the idea after they tried to put a string around my waist and put a flip-flop on. That didn't work, but this did. It only took a few minutes to cut and put it together in the fashion lab. Gretchen helped. I want to make it in cherish.â€¶<br><br>â€¶Cherish?â€¶<br><br>â€¶The fabric Gretchen and I are working on?â€¶<br><br>â€¶Oh right. How does it stay on?â€¶<br><br>â€¶The C stands for clitoris. The top ties around my clit, and the bottom has a little ball that stays in my butthole. See?â€¶ She bent down to look at it along with him. Indeed the top was a little bud of fabric over where her clit would be.<br><br>â€¶Hi hi!â€¶<br><br>She did her trick of bobbing her clit up and down. Hidden behind the fabric, it looked like the head of a modest women who had a sheet pulled over her.<br><br>â€¶Now watch!â€¶ With a quick motion of her fingers and a little grunt, the C-string was off and held triumphantly over her head. The little ball was the size of a large marble. The whole item was about three inches long and half an inch wide.<br><br>Now she rinsed it in the sink and pressed it dry with a napkin. And with a little motion of her hips and fingers, it was back on again.<br><br>â€¶Oh Baby!â€¶ She giggled and the C-string seemed to giggle too. â€¶Finally! Clothes! Dr. Kantor says this is the big breakthrough! After this I can progress to even more clothes! Wheee!!â€¶<br><br>She hopped onto Rod's stockinged feet and they kissed. â€¶Babe, I'm so glad,â€¶ he said, more as a response to her happiness than to anything else.<br><br>Tami then hopped off him and dragged him into the living room, breasts bouncing, taking little mincing steps that were unusual for her. She ran to the CD player. As she bent over Rod could see the C-string upside down, coming out of her butthole and disappearing between into the bush between her legs. Then she hopped up and stood before the big full-length mirror.<br><br>It was Madonna's â€¶Vogueâ€¶, a song she rarely played. As the beat began Tami twisted to and fro, posing like in the video, all the time keeping her legs open, pushing her pelvis forward, emphasizing the C-string, and maximizing its visibility. â€¶Clothes! Clothes! Yay!â€¶ she chanted, giddy like a little girl.<br><br>Rod laughed, taking this to be a display of good-natured sarcasm. â€¶Clothesâ€¶, indeed! Hardly more than a thread, lodged between her lower lips. But as Tami continued dancing in the mirror, kicking to the side, doing some slow cartwheels and some other gymnast moves, his smile faded as he realized she really did consider herself to be wearing clothes, genuinely thrilled to be in her C-string.<br><br>He even started to feel his eyes getting wet. Yes, Tami had been naked for over three years, had long ago gotten used to being naked, had long ago lost any sense of modesty about every inch of her being on public display at all times. Yet he couldn't help but think that deep inside there was still that frightened, modest 18-year-old, that Girl in the Mirror, dying of shame at having to walk around naked, who was joyously celebrating her dream come true, a happy ending to her fable at long last.<br><br>He thought of that long ride home, when he had picked her up in Providence that dreary cold January day, the negative reaction of her father to seeing his daughter taken up with a black man, the sudden break of clouds over John Smithers's head when he decided it was OK, Tami's endless sucking of his penis on the way up to Campbell-Frank. That was probably the first time she had seemed at ease with being naked. Only later did he realize that she was deeply ashamed, looking for any way out of her predicament, desperate for any merest scrap of clothing. Well, now she had it!<br><br>The song ended and Tami had worked up a sweat. She playfully collapsed into Rod's arms. He kissed her deep, then held her away from him to look down again at her precious wardrobe.<br><br>â€¶Tugs at your clit a lot,â€¶ he observed.<br><br>â€¶Oh Babyâ€¦ With every motion. That's why it works. It turns me on as I'm wearing something.â€¶ Her legs shook. â€¶It is time for a f**k!!â€¶ And she pulled him toward the bedroom. Halfway there she undid his fly. She pulled him the rest of the way via his floppy but hardening dick.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>â€¶Unhhh! Unhhh! OHHH!!â€¶<br><br>Tami was cresting into her eighth orgasm. Rod looked at the clock radio. Thirty-two minutes. Exactly one every four minutes. He reached up and kneaded her nipples to extend her orgasm. She yelped accordingly.<br><br>After the last irregular spasms had spent themselves, she exhaled and lay down on his chest. She kissed him and then rose up to begin the ascent to number nine.<br><br>Rod looked at her sweating face in the near-total darkness. Then he looked at the C-string tied to the bedpost. Then outside at the streetlight. He thought of the 1991 World Series â€”<br><br>â€¶Ummmmâ€¦ â€¶<br><br>An equation he had been working on on the dam site â€”<br><br>â€¶Ooooohh yeahâ€¦ â€¶<br><br>That strange sound the fan belt on his Jeep had been making â€”<br><br>â€¶Zhhhhhâ€¦ oh wowâ€¦â€¶<br><br>He got distracted by Tami, who now rose up to the crest of number nine. â€¶Eeeeâ€¦ OHHH! Oh Rod!! OHHHH!!â€¶ Rather fast, that one.<br><br>Tami lay down on his chest again and stayed there, catching her breath. He expected her to rise up again but she just stayed there, rubbing his sides. Strange that she would be finished. Nine orgasms was usually just a warmup for her.<br><br>He thought of the future, when Tami would be wearing clothes. After a few weeks her wonderful all-over tan would be gone, replaced by the tan lines that white girls specialized in. And her ability to predict the weather with her nipples, and the sense she got of other people's feelings, those would probably fade away in time too. A shame, really. If only the whole world could be naked. The naked Tami was a kind of advanced human being that the world just wasn't ready for. But it would be all for the best. As a naked woman after graduation, in the world as it is, Tami would lead a severely restricted life, a life of horrible loneliness in a way.<br><br>Tami lifted her head and gave him a slow kiss. Then she slid off his dick and scooted down. She held the wet, hard dick in her hand. Then began licking up the sides. Slowly, philosophically, as if licking a lollipop while thinking on some profound question.<br><br>Rod smiled. He didn't have to come. In fact recently he hadn't been coming at all. â€¶It's O.K., Babe,â€¶ he said. Using his standard line, he said, â€¶I'm a little tired anyway.â€¶<br><br>Tami opened her eyes wide and said, â€¶Notâ€¦ ifâ€¦ Iâ€¦ canâ€¦ helpâ€¦ it!â€¶ Then she sat up cross-legged, straightened her throat, opened her jaw like a snake, and dropped her head to consume more of Rod's dick than she ever had before.<br><br>â€¶Oh â€” wow!â€¶ he couldn't help saying. How did she do that? The head of my dick must be all the way down her throat?<br><br>â€¶Gahhhh,â€¶ was the grunting sound Tami made as she pulled herself off his dick. As she smacked her lips, strands of saliva suspended from the tip. The saliva in the bottom of the throat must be really thick. Then she rubbed his dick head with her fingers in a way to make him jump.<br><br>He watched her do that for a few seconds. Then she tried to speak but couldn't. She cleared her throat. Her voice was guttural as she said, â€¶Tonight, Rod, you will have multiple orgasms!â€¶<br><br>Rod laughed at the joke, thinking of that time he had confessed to her that he was jealous of her orgasmic capacity. â€¶Yeah, right Babe. One is fine.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, I've been doing some research,â€¶ Tami said. â€¶Ever hear of Tantra?â€¶<br><br>He remembered reading about that a long time ago. â€¶You mean, where the man doesn't get to come at all?â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, no, you misunderstand,â€¶ Tami said, casually slapping his dick against her face. â€¶You come without ejaculating. Take deep breaths, stop before you spurt, then you feel the spasms. Then they subside and you go up again. Only on the last orgasm do you ejaculate.â€¶<br><br>He was unconvinced. â€¶Sounds kind ofâ€¦ contrived.â€¶<br><br>â€¶No, noâ€¦ the spasms without spurting are an orgasm like a woman has. Try it, please, Baby?â€¶<br><br>Her green eyes were so wide and earnest. It was impossible to say no to Tami.<br><br>As she started sucking him again he realized how well she knew his body. Probably she knew that his mind had been elsewhere during sexâ€¦ He felt bad about being false to her. But then all other feelings fell away as his excitement rose. Faster and faster, deeper and deeper, her bobbing head took in his dick. He breathed deeply as she had told him.<br><br>He felt himself getting up into â€¶the zoneâ€¶, then felt that little gate open up in the base of his dick, the â€¶pre-cumâ€¶â€¦ Tami sensed this and hopped up onto all fours so that he could mount her. He was more in control in this position so he could be more careful.<br><br>As he humped her he began to feel the big rush inside him and stopped thrusting. It subsided and he began thrusting again. Then it came up higher and he stopped again. Breathe, breatheâ€¦<br><br>Now that wonderful instant when his whole body was flooded with pure pleasure. But this was not fleeting, it went on for several seconds. Then his dick jumped and he felt the spasms, maybe four or five of them. But no spurting!<br><br>He came down and then started thrusting again. The big rush again, his whole body on a high. He just couldn't hold back this time. He kept going and his dick erupted what felt like a quart of semen into Tami's pussy. It kept on and on. It seemed like he would never stop squirting.<br><br>Afterward he flopped onto his back, gasping as if he'd just run up a mountain. Tami slid onto his chest. When he seemed able to speak, she ran her finger around his lips.<br><br>â€¶So, loverâ€¦ seemed like you did it.â€¶<br><br>Rod, back to earth now, was able to be objective. â€¶That was greatâ€¦ but weird.â€¶<br><br>â€¶You had two orgasms.â€¶<br><br>â€¶That first one was wellâ€¦ I suppose it was an orgasm.â€¶<br><br>They lay there for a few moments.<br><br>â€¶Thanks Babe,â€¶ he said. â€¶But you're still the champ. I don't think I can everâ€¦â€¶<br><br>â€¶I'd say it was a good start.â€¶<br><br>They lay there and hugged. He kissed her one last time. Within five minutes they were fast asleep.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rod straightened his sleeve and looked down with mixed feelings at his new uniform. He glanced around and saw that he was in a big room. Tunemasters uniforms were milling all around. Playing with the slide of his trombone, he decided to sit down at one of the long tables near the sodas.<br><br>He looked around for Brigid. She was not hard to pick out." }
