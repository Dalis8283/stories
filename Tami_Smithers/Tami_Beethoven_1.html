      { title: "Chapter 1", content: "‶Here's some burnt connective tissue,‶ she said, wiping a small grease splatter off her nipple and forking three strips of bacon onto Rod's plate.  Before turning back to the stove she snapped off a piece for herself.  Burnt connective tissue tasted so good sometimes, especially on a late winter morning like this.<br><br>Her comment was playing to her vegetarian guests, Jen and Leisha, married three years ago under the laws of the State of Vermont, who were taking in Tami's famous soy flour pancakes.  Dressed in flannel shirts, jeans, and sneakers with nice thick wool socks, they also took in the trim butt cheeks as Tami worked the stove, cheeks that were always bare like the rest of her and were a prime display of her trademark tan.  It was well observed in the Campbell-Frank College community that Tami's summer skin was copper, but her winter skin was a light brown, a change like the summer and winter colors of certain birds.  But at any time of year, her permanently nude body was one of the glories of the local countryside.<br><br>She turned to slide another pancake onto Jen's plate.  ‶Nice, what is that, burgundy, Tam?‶ Jen said.  Tami stood back, playfully tossing her shoulder-length hair like in a shampoo commercial, then looking down to her full length nudity.  Her hair, her fingernails, her pubic hair (‶lower hair‶, she called it), and her toenails were all the same reddish color, a shade lighter than her natural hair color.  ‶No, more magenta-ish.  The box calls it 'Plum',‶ she said.  ‶Goes well.‶  ‶Thanks.  I might stick with this for a while.‶  ‶I still like the all-black look on you.‶<br><br>As Jen said this she brushed aside a few of the beer bottle caps that had some time ago spilled over the top of the big round oatmeal carton that graced the end of the table.  Most of the caps reflected Tami's favorite brand.  The carton had been there a year but, still, that was a whole lot of caps.  Behind the mountain of caps, on the wall, a bulletin board with various pictures and notices, many way out of date.  And a little framed note that said, in Tami's neat hand,<br><br><div style=‶font-size: 1.2em; text-align: right; width: 50%; padding-left: auto; padding-right: auto;‶><p>𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓅𝓉ℯ𝓇𝒲ℴ𝓊𝓁𝒹 𝓎ℴ𝓊 𝓈𝓅ℯ𝓃𝒹 𝓎ℴ𝓊𝓇 𝓁𝒾𝒻ℯ<br>𝒲𝒾𝓉𝒽 𝒶 𝓃𝒶𝓀ℯ𝒹 𝓌𝒾𝒻ℯ?</p></div><br><br>Next to that, a Pawtucket Red Sox hat, push-pinned into the board.<br><br>Rod, about ten minutes from having to leave for work, ready for the outside world in his gray button-down shirt, dark pants and engineer's boots, looked up from reading this morning's news on his laptop.  He reflected on how Tami's appearance had changed over the past three years.  Her face, for one thing.  Longer, a bit more angular, more like a mature woman.  Looking back at those old photos now, like from the Black Formal he had taken Tami to during her first semester, her face seemed more babyish, almost chubby.  Now it was more ‶beautiful‶, as if to catch up with those bright green eyes.<br><br>Her body, too, was a bit more angular, the muscles slightly better defined, especially around the midriff and that tight little butt typical of white girls.  Her breasts seemed a bit larger.  Remarkably they did not sag, being without the benefit of a bra all this time.  Maybe not so remarkable.  When she was a sophomore Tami had dug up a study showing that bras, for all their other purposes, do not really prevent sagging.  Sounded wrong, but in Tami's case the theory was correct.<br><br>Looking at her matching hair and nails, Rod was glad that her personal fashion sense, or what fashion choices life had permitted her in light of her allergy, had calmed down.  That sophomore year, at least the second half, was a wild ride.  Blazing colors, half-buzz cuts, shaving into a ‶T‶ for Tami, Bride of Frankenstein shocks -- Tami's crotch was like a dazzling billboard bopping around the campus and town, making it even more the center of attention that it already was wherever she went.  Her upper hair was no less flamboyant, one month almost a Mohawk, the next green dreadlocks, and usually different color nail polish on each finger and toe.  It was a trial to be seen with her, though he never admitted it.  Just when he was hoping people would get used to this naked girl walking around, she calls attention to herself.<br><br>Then that summer internship in Germany, working with a famous math professor on six-dimensional polymers or whatever it was -- he never could quite understand her attempts to explain it, even though he was about to complete an engineering degree with two years of calculus.  When she came back in August she was so enthusiastic.  ‶Germany is such a totally nude friendly country.  It's where nudism began.  They go out naked to the parks.  I'd walk out and, it was like, I'm not the only one for once.  It was so nice not being stared at.  Everyone was so polite and grown-up about it.  One day they had an exhibit at an art museum; it was a really hot day, so if you went naked you got in free.  I was just one of the crowd.  I wished all the time you could be there and we'd be naked together.  Of course,‶ they were on the bed at the time, late at night, ‶I wouldn't be able to control myself, looking at this!  Roarrr!‶  Whereupon she grabbed his dick, swung it around from the base like a floppy baseball bat, then took it into her throat.<br><br>When she came back from that summer she was full of German phrases.  He had learned a little bit from his father, who had been stationed there during his Army days, and had thought it a military and harsh language.  But then he heard Tami speak it in a gentle, musical way and it was enchanting.  ‶I love the way you wrap your lips around those umlauts,‶ was his favorite phrase for a while.<br><br>She had also, really for the first time, embraced what she called ‶the theory of nudism‶ -- the beneficial effect of the elements on bare skin.  She was determined to live in as natural a state as possible and it was almost as hard to take as The Year of the Dazzling Pubic Hair.  She let her legs and armpits go unshaved, let her hair grow wild and long, till it was almost to her butt.  And she would take long hikes at night in the woods behind the house.  He had quite a shock the first time he woke up in the middle of the night to see a wild naked white woman, autumn leaves in her hair, perched in the opened bedroom window, dirt-covered toes curling over the sill, green eyes glowing in the dark, then pouncing across the room onto him, pulling the covers off, commandeering his dick, and jumping on it to ride him through her many orgasms, his crotch scratched by crumpling leaves that had gotten caught in her lower hair.  She did this a number of times until the novelty wore off.<br><br>Maybe he was too buttoned-down.  Maybe there was a wildness inside him that she was trying to tap, without saying so.  Certainly when they were alone she was wild enough for both of them.  But it was good to see her calm down and settle on ‶Plum‶.<br><br>He returned to reading his laptop.  Tami kissed the shaved smoothness of his ebony scalp and scooted in across from him, beside her old roommate Jen.  While shoveling in her third helping of potatoes she turned a bit, drew her leg up toward the microwave with her gymnast's flexibility, and with her dexterous toes tapped in ninety seconds for the eggs.  A flick of her pinky toe and it turned on.<br><br>‶Ooo ooo ooo,‶ Leisha said in a raspy voice.  Tami smiled.  Her friends sometimes made chimp sounds when she used her feet like hands.  For her it had been a natural progression, going around in bare feet for three years with toes always out there and available.  It also made the wedding band more noticeable, on the third toe of her left foot, matching the larger one which Rod wore in the conventional place.<br><br>‶Going to Killington today?‶ Rod asked.  (The biggest ski center in Vermont.)<br><br>‶Not sure.  Might be too warm,‶ Jen said, leaning against Leisha.  They were more or less bumming around the region until Leisha's next anthropology conference in Montreal.  Jen, daughter of wealth, was conducting a very low-key job search, hoping to land an assistant professorship next fall.<br><br>Rod tapped a few keys.  ‶Says it'll be cloudy today, possible rain, up to 40.‶<br><br>Tami stretched and thrust out her breasts.  ‶No, that's wrong.‶<br><br>Jen smiled.  ‶Accu-tits weather.‶<br><br>The naked 22-year-old got up and stretched again, giving Jen and Leisha a mouth-watering view of her breasts riding up on her perfectly formed body.  She tapped on her dark brown, permanently erect nipples with her index fingers and then flicked them up and down, making her breasts jiggle, giggling as her guests swooned.  ‶Let me go out and check.  I forgot the mail yesterday anyway.‶<br><br>After she had gone, Rod, checking sports scores, said, ‶See Tam's latest rescue?‶<br><br>Jen and Leisha looked at each other with a flash of realization.  ‶So that wasn't a dream.‶<br><br>‶No, another girl from Teaser's.‶  Rod exhaled.  ‶Luci, the manager, called around midnight.  I keep telling Tam it's not her place to put herself out so, but you know how she is.  At least this one was just weepy and drunk.  We put her on the couch in the sun room.‶<br><br>‶I think Herr Remmler would have approved,‶ Jen said, referring to the deceased professor emeritus at Chalfont who had willed this little house to Tami and her husband for as long as she was associated with the college.  Rod shrugged helplessly.  Providing emergency shelter for wayward strippers was one of many things he had to resign himself to, as husband of Queen Tami the Nude.<br><br>Tami returned sorting mail in her hands, tapping last night's fluffy snow off her toes, having padded silently down the driveway to the mailbox and no doubt waved at the ever-present Mrs. McBreer across the street.  Having sampled the outside air, her nipples could give a more accurate forecast.  ‶It's about 25 now, going up only to 35.  Clear all day.‶<br><br>Leisha said, ‶Clear tomorrow too?‶<br><br>‶Vielleicht,‶ Tami said, parking her butt down where it was before.  One of the German words she still occasionally used -- they knew by now that ‶vielleicht‶ means ‶probably‶.<br><br>Another huge scoop of potatoes into her mouth, to the amusement of Jen and Leisha.  It was often remarked that during the cold months, Tami ate like a hog.<br><br>They breakfasted silently for a moment, Rod reading his laptop, the two African-American women wiping up the last of the syrup as they leaned against each other, about as true as true love can get.<br><br>Rod could sense it before it actually happened.  Beneath the table, Tami's snow-encrusted toes now caressed the crotch of his pants.  ‶How about a quick go-round?‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 2", content: "‶Babe, you're going to kill me,‶ he said for about the ten thousandth time.<br><br>‶You're the one who attacked me, last night,‶ the naked girl countered.<br><br>‶It was more like you attacking me,‶ he said.<br><br>‶That was only the second time.‶<br><br>‶And the third.‶<br><br>After a quick wink to Leisha, Jen quietly slid under the table.  A quick inhale from Tami ensued.<br><br>‶Thanks, Jen,‶ Rod said.  The experiments that Tami had been coerced into undergoing at Chalfont during that awful freshman year had created within her an insatiable sex drive which had not diminished after all this time.  Rod knew that Tami's dedication to him was total, but also knew that he just did not have the time or the energy, or maybe the staying power, to keep her from climbing the walls all by himself.<br><br>It got worse after that bra and panties that had been so diabolically designed for her at Chalfont, with the bristles and dildos inside, got too uncomfortable for her to wear.  It was a shame.  It was the only thing she could wear after her allergy set in.  They would be happily hanging out on the porch on a fall evening, him in his sweats and her in that bikini, conversation interrupted only by her quivering now and then as she worked the remote in her hand.  Afterward she would be sated and happy for hours.  But then, not far into her sophomore year, she felt confined with those straps around her back and her hips.  According to Dr. Kantor, the behavioral therapist at Chalfont who had been assigned to cure her clothes aversion, it was simply another manifestation of the allergy.<br><br>Now the bristle bra and dildo panties hung, unused, in the closet.  Add to this the odd fact that Tami just could not reach orgasm by her own hands.  The help of others was just necessary.  Rod had adjusted to that fact a long time ago.  So he appreciated Jen's help.  Besides, Jen had a kind of seniority.<br><br>Under the table, Jen's tongue worked her magic.  It never took long with Tami.  She swallowed, then lay her head back, eyes half-closed.  Then soft, breathy moans escaped between her deepening breaths.  Tami's orgasms had a wonderful diversity, every one was different, but the general signs of her ascent were well known.  One foot came up to brace against the wall next to the microwave, as if she was about to defy gravity and walk up sideways.  Leisha cradled the other foot in her lap.  Toes spread and the naked young woman swallowed quickly, then held her breath as she waited for the onslaught.  Rod lifted his coffee off the table.<br><br>‶Zhh!!  Zhh!!  Zhh!!‶  Eyes exploded open.  Her knees jerked up with each jolt, banging up against the table and causing plates to clatter (but not coffee to spill).  Rod disengaged himself from today's news and looked at his beautiful wife.  One could only smile.  He never tired of seeing her face registering the greatest physical pleasure a person can know.  This was a really violent one, her body showed incredible strength – he almost believed she could lift a car with her upward jerks.  He admired Jen's virtuosity.  He had gotten better at oral sex over   the past few years, but maybe it takes a woman to really know what works best on another woman.<br><br>In fact he was convinced of it.  Tami and her female ‶fans‶ (as he thought of them) seemed to occupy a world different from his.  A totally female world.  The last time Jen and Leisha visited was memorable.  It was one of those Saturdays he'd had to work.  He left after lunch, Tami sitting like she often did, cross-legged on top of the living room table, with her two seated friends holding her hands.  Jen had brought some white wine and bread and cheese; Jen liked to bring in some elegant props and it was unspoken that they were getting ready for one of their little ‶events‶.<br><br>He got to the project -- restoring an old dam near the Canadian border -- and it was hard for him to concentrate.  His mind wandered so much that the jeep he was driving almost drifted off the service road at one point.  He kept wondering, what are they doing to her now?  His mind relaxed after about three o'clock, realizing they must be finished and sitting around, maybe while Tami took one of her frequent afternoon naps.<br><br>The job took longer than he thought.  At six he called home but there was no answer.  He left a message on the machine promising to be back at nine sharp.  When that time finally rolled around, bleary-eyed and exhausted, he rolled into the driveway and stumbled into the living room.<br><br>He was stunned.  They were still at it.  Tami was on the table, on all fours, covered in sweat, her hair dripping around her face.  Behind her, Jen was slowly working a big ribbed dildo in and out of her rectum, while licking her pussy, drawing out the lips, poking at the clit with the tip of her tongue.  Leisha, sitting on the other end, had drawn the end of Tami's stretched breast into her mouth, vigorously sucking on the nipple while reaching over to rub the other nipple between her thumb and forefinger.  Tami's whole body was tight as a drum, her toes twitching, suspended right on the brink.<br><br>Had they been going all this time?  Jen and Leisha were still fully dressed, not a button undone.  Had Tami been pleasured for nine hours straight?  Had they given her a breather?  How many times had she come?  Were there any limits at all to the sexual capacity of his naked wife?  Questions flooded his suddenly awake mind.  The wine had almost all been drunk, some crumbs of bread still on the plate.  It was as if Tami was the main course.<br><br>He had sometimes resented it -- he sometimes imagined they were seeing how many orgasms they could get out of her, playing her like a pinball machine.  Yet that was not it.  It was something more like communion -- maybe Tami, raised Catholic, got some kind of fulfillment out of it, Catholicism had always been something alien to him -- or maybe more like worship.<br><br>It turned out, unexpectedly, to be romantic.  The three women did not appear to notice his approach.  But then as he got near the table Jen and Leisha accelerated their ministrations, and as he circled Tami's shaking body and came around to her sweaty face, he caught a look in her half-opened, feverish eyes that could only be called pure love.  He then knew what to do -- he bent over and kissed her, a full-throated kiss, and as he did she lurched forward, moaned loudly into his mouth, and her whole body spasmed, and spasmed again.<br><br>More followed.  It was a powerful orgasm even for Tami.  Her whole body quaked and quaked, as Jen and Leisha hung on for dear life and he kept his lips on hers, grasping the damp hair behind her head, and she held her lips to his to the extent she could.  The whole event, the whole nine hours, had been a preparation, waiting for him to join her as she scaled and reached what must have been the pinnacle of ecstasy.<br><br>Rod thought of that time as, now at the breakfast table, he saw the post-orgasmic catching of breath, the slight sheen of sweat, the hands that went under the table to caress Jen's hair, which nowadays was set in short cornrows.  Tami was descending to the plateau now, from whence she could rise and then rise again -- ‶going up‶, she called it.  Leisha watched intently too.<br><br>Inconsequentially, the microwave beeped and the eggs were ready.<br><br>Now the ascent to the second orgasm.<br><br>‶Rrringg!!‶<br><br>Rod was about to get up when Tami reached up with a sharp motion and got the phone.  Maybe it was her good-girl, straight-A sense of duty, her Catholic upbringing, but she would not let her orgasms interfere with anything.  She pushed down the crest with a visible effort.  ‶H - hello.‶<br><br>‶Oh hi Wanda,‶ she said with a smile and she relaxed and went back to riding Jen's tongue.  She looked and fondled the cornrows.  ‶Wow.  C - congratulationsssss!!‶  She seemed happily surprised and glad for her old friend.  To Rod and Leisha she said, ‶W - Wanda's b - been hired by th - the B - Boston D.A. off -- off -- office -- Ohhhh!‶<br><br>Her eyes opened to the ceiling and lost focus as they always did just as an orgasm began.  She was listening to what Wanda was saying, or at least trying to.  How did she do that?  He had asked her once -- ‶I just play back in my mind what I just heard.‶  It probably took practice, but of course, she had had plenty of that.<br><br>Spasms and little grunts followed.  She was holding back her vocalizations so she could hear better.  Then she looked down at Jen.  ‶W - wanda says hi.‶  She hadn't needed to mention Jen's name.<br><br>‶Ohh!‶  Her pelvis jerked.  Jen had apparently delivered a little rough suction to Tami's clit.  This was Jen's way of saying, ‶Hi, Wanda.‶<br><br>Jen and Wanda continued to converse through Tami's body for a little while, sentences, pauses, commas, an occasional exclamation point.  Then: ‶T - tomorrow night then -- ohhhh!. . . OK . . .‶  After replacing the receiver with great effort Tami exhaled and caressed Jen's hair, lurched one final time, then came down from the plateau at last.  ‶Mmmmm . . .‶  After a few moments Jen came up to lay her head against Tami's breasts, like a contented baby with a tummy full of mother's milk.<br><br>Rod felt his dick, recently given up for dead, stirring.  It was Tami's musk, which filled the room and made it hot and humid.  He might or might not be able to get fully erect again but it was a moot point; it was time to go to work.  He put the laptop on ‶hibernate‶ and went to get his briefcase.  When he returned a couple of minutes later he said, ‶Your guest is up.  I found her in the hall.‶<br><br>Tami, by then back in this world with her orange juice and eggs, said, ‶Tell her to come in.  She must be hungry.‶<br><br>‶She's too shy.  She'd rather stay in her room. . . Well, good-bye Babe.‶  Off to his new engineer job in Burlington, his first real job after the year with the Army Corps of Engineers which had been a condition of his scholarship to Campbell-Frank.<br><br>Tami stood her naked self in front of him, her breasts jiggling as she straightened his tie.<br><br>‶Thanks Mom,‶ he said.<br><br>‶'Clothes make the man,'‶ she said as she looked him up and down admiringly.<br><br>Which was greeted with a snort.  He put his finger behind his tie.  ‶Akk.  If the world is ruled by men, how come we have to wear ties?‶<br><br>‶Because it's not ruled by smart men.‶<br><br>‶What's on today, Babe?‶<br><br>‶Aside from the usual, I have the presentation in Fashion Design with Gretchen.  I think she'll be all right.  Also they want to see me about something.  Then Kantor.‶<br><br>Rod exhaled in exasperation.  ‶It just goes on and on.  Why doesn't Kantor or Abu Jamal talk to you?  I think they're holding back on something.‶<br><br>‶Oh I know they're holding back,‶ Tami said.  ‶They'll tell me when they're ready.‶  Once again, the odd fact: Rod wanted one of the many therapies they had tried to finally work, while Tami seemed to take it one day at a time.<br><br>A slow kiss on the lips, bare arms around his coat, tan midriff against his belt buckle, toes wrapping around his gumshoe boots, and Rod was gone." },
      { title: "Chapter 3", content: "She woke groggily but then with a sudden sense of alarm.  She was in a strange bed.  The strap of her camisole had pulled off her shoulder and she straightened it.  Her black vinyl pants were bunched up too.  She poked her head up from the covers like a ground hog.  What had she gotten herself into?  Had somebody dragged her half-naked drunk body into bed and humped her?  She had heard of that happening --<br><br>Fortunately her private parts did not hurt.  She felt more or less in one piece, except for the hangover.  And this sun room she was in did not seem sleazy, in fact it seemed respectable and neat.<br><br>Taking care not to move too fast -- with her hangover she could easily get dizzy -- she got up and saw that her shoes were placed neatly on the floor.  She clumsily slipped her bare feet into the glass-bottomed, four-inch-high platform sandals and, straightening out her long black hair behind her, took stock of where she was.<br><br>A nice little house.  As she lurched into the next room, a living room, she tried to dismiss the weird dream from last night.  Practically being thrown into the cold night air, a cold ride in a pickup truck with someone who spoke gibberish, then a naked super-woman picking her up like she weighed nothing and carrying her inside.  It was obviously a dream, at least the last part.<br><br>Pierre, Pierre . . . I know he won't forgive me for this . . .<br><br>She heard voices far away somewhere.  Trying to trace their source she found herself in what must be a master bedroom.  A queen-size bed, recently slept in.  An open closet with lots of clothes -- just men's clothes.  She looked around for women's clothes and shoes and found none.  Just a guy must live here.  She also noticed that the covers were thrown back on only one side of the bed.  Single.  And a gentleman, not to have screwed her last night.<br><br>There was a big window showing the back yard, and a computer table with books and papers, a monitor and keyboard.  The mouse and its pad were on the floor, under the chair.  Weird.<br><br>Her eyes were arrested by the pictures on the dresser.  Naked girls.  No, they were all the same girl.  That super-woman?  The big photo, in the middle, with her standing on a riser in front of a cheering crowd, flowers in her hair, next to a young black man in a white formal type coat.  It could be a wedding picture, but for the missing bridal gown.  A young lady in a minister outfit is next to them, and a straggly-looking bearded guy in a blazer and jeans.  The naked girl looks so out of place, with everyone else fully clothed.<br><br>Another picture, the same naked girl, sitting on a throne wearing a tiara, with an exaggerated haughty expression.  Below her, on some steps with a red carpet, three girls in matching red and black, bowing to her.  One was white, one was thin and black, another was Hispanic-looking with giant tits almost spilling out of her low-cut dress.  Another picture, of the naked girl in the tiara, this time with her arm around another girl, thin and white and kind of no-nonsense looking, in a kind of business suit.<br><br>Some smaller pictures of the naked girl with what must be a brother and her parents, cropped at her bare shoulders.  Now the same brother it looked like, in uniform next to an American flag.  There she is with her shoulders again, next to the black guy, this time he's in a black graduation gown, with what must be his parents.  The father is bent over and supports himself with a cane.  Quite a contrast in that photo, with her bare white skin.<br><br>On the other wall a large painting caught her eye.  Somehow she hadn't noticed it before.  It was the same girl, in a chair in what looked like the stacks of a library, pausing from reading a book as if pleasantly surprised to see the viewer.  The book is half-open in her hands over her flat tummy.  Totally naked, her pubic hair and breasts on full view, yet not showing them off either.  Her attitude was strange -- not at all like a stripper, just the opposite.  As if she didn't even know she was naked.  Both her face and her body are beautiful, as if the artist was in love with her.<br><br>Now on another little table, set apart, a frame with photos of a tall, friendly-looking guy with black curly hair, wearing a long black coat, and a girl in red lipstick in a black dress with a real long string of pearls, leaning against a lamp post, her hips playfully swayed and her head tilted, like a hooker.  This is the white girl from the throne photo.  Between them, a photo of the World Trade Center.<br><br>She looked at the doorway, thinking she heard a movement.  I shouldn't be in here.  So she scampered back into the hall, realizing how loud these ridiculous stripper shoes were on the hardwood floor.  Still a bit hung over and disoriented, she made a wrong turn and found herself facing a bathroom.  Too late to turn back.  So she went in, her shoes stomping on the little tiles, and closed the door.<br><br>No sound.  She found that she did have to pee and sat down.  The bathroom was tiny.  As she exhaled and let it flow she looked at the bathtub and shower right next to her and realized that there wasn't just a guy living here.  Three bottles of shampoo, one of conditioner, then some hair coloring.  They couldn't be for the guy because his head was shaved.  On the sink were a brush with reddish hair in it, and a long comb.  Also a very short little comb, like guys might use on a moustache.  Odd, the guy in the pics didn't have a moustache.  What's the little comb for?<br><br>Reaching over for the toilet paper she was startled to see a big blue rubber bag on the floor with a narrow tube coming out of it.  Where had she seen that before?  Oh right -- that dancer Lita had one, who kept talking the virtues of anal sex.  Ewww, an enema bag.  Well, now I know more about this girl living here than I really want to.<br><br>And now she detected the faint odor of vomit.  She thought: great.  She's bulimic too.<br><br>Back to the bed in that little sun room.  She waited and there was no motion.  She got up again.<br><br>‶Oh,‶ she said, startled in the hall by a tall black man about 25 years old, with a shaved head and wire-rimmed glasses, in a suit and big brown boots.  This was the guy from the photos.<br><br>‶Hello, are you feeling O.K.?‶ he said, with concern.<br><br>‶Oui . . . Merci . . . yes. . .‶  She was babbling.<br><br>‶You were quite a mess last night.  You probably need some food in you.‶<br><br>That would ease the hangover, at least.  She smelled eggs and pancakes cooking from somewhere.  A telephone rang and there were female voices.  Uh - oh . . . a woman gasping as if she were crying.  Some kind of scene was going on.<br><br>‶I still am need to sleep,‶ she said.  She couldn't concentrate to speak good English right now.<br><br>‶O.K. I have to go.  My wife's name is Tami.  You can't miss her,‶  he added with a smile.  ‶She'll take you to the help center.  Good luck getting back on your feet.‶<br><br>She watched him go.  She wanted him to stay.  Anything to keep from the clutches of this Tami girl.  She was getting a very bad feeling about her.  Into anal sex, bulimic, takes naked pictures, even with her family -- and now she's breaking down in the kitchen.  How did this O.K. seeming guy get involved with her?  And why was he leaving her to cry in the kitchen?  It made her own situation seem positively normal.<br><br>She tumbled back onto the refuge of the bed, wearing her shoes in bed even though it was impolite.<br><br>She couldn't stay there forever.  It was about fifteen minutes later that she got her courage up to traverse the narrow little hallway, the walls studded with ornately framed black-and-white photos of old men and old women like from a hundred years ago.  Then she turned the corner and --<br><br>‶Hi, Yvette!‶<br><br>The cheerful girl was next to the stove with a spatula in her hand, facing her as if glad to see her.  And without a stitch of clothing.  The naked super-woman, in the (bare) flesh!  And with no sign of having cried.<br><br>Yvette, her mouth open, took in the bare breasts and pubic hair and bare legs.  The only thing this girl was wearing was a little golden ring on one toe.  Yvette shielded her eyes.  ‶So sorry -- ‶<br><br>‶No, it's O.K.‶ she said with a laugh.  ‶I'm Tami.  Excuse my appearance.  I'm allergic to clothes.‶<br><br>‶That's right, she is,‶ said Jen with a mouth full of pancakes.  Leisha, also eating but a bit more refined, nodded in agreement.<br><br>Yvette slowly unshielded her eyes and accepted the invitation to sit down.  There was a table setting in front of her.  She nodded to the black women.  Do they live here too?  What kind of kinkiness was going on?  Does the fact that this Tami is the only white person in the house have something to do with her showing her skin all the time?<br><br>She watched Tami's backside as she worked the stove.  Yvette was a stripper and had seen plenty of naked women walking around, but only on stage or in the dressing room.  At home, strippers tended to cover up.  This was decidedly weird.<br><br>Yvette quickly blinked and realized: and what a body.  Thin, firm, narrow waist, nice tits.  And a pretty face with striking green eyes.  She'd never seen a girl on the circuit so good-looking.<br><br>‶Eggs, pancakes, bacon, cereal, oatmeal?‶ Tami said.  ‶Tami's diner, at your service.‶<br><br>Yvette had taken in the ordinary, good-natured atmosphere in the room and decided it was impolite to act freaked out by Tami's nudity.  After all, she should be grateful, a safe night's sleep in a clean bed.  ‶Oatmeal, s'il vous plait.‶<br><br>Her mettle was tested again as Tami crouched and then leapt three feet up onto the counter.  Her naked host opened the cupboard and stood up there and reached into a shelf near the ceiling.  In the meantime she resumed a conversation she had been having with Jen.<br><br>‶So what kind of job is that?‶<br><br>Jen described a position that had opened up at Middlebury College that she was interested in.  Tami said periodic ‶mm - hmm's‶ as she pushed aside boxes of cereal to get at the oatmeal.  Meanwhile her toes reached over to the sink and turned on a faucet.  Having found the oatmeal she searched further in for the honey.  Two quick passes of her toes under the spigot to test if the water was getting hot, then the foot stretched over to the back burner for the kettle.  ‶Mm -- hmm. . . Sounds kind of boring . . . Aren't you overqualified for that?‶  Clasping toes placed the kettle under the spigot.  Tami hopped down with the oatmeal and honey, so gracefully that the only sound was the soft click of the toe ring as it hit the wood floor.<br><br>Yvette thought: this girl is like a monkey.<br><br>The oatmeal was very good, if a bit rough going down.  Tami had simply poured the oats into a bowl and added hot water.  ‶Better fiber that way,‶ she said.<br><br>‶Well . . .‶ Jen said.<br><br>Tami laughed.  ‶Actually if I try to make it the real way, it's awful.‶<br><br>Jen and Leisha had to leave.  Their bags were already packed in the hallway.  They each hugged Tami's bare bod, but casually.  They would be passing by again in a few weeks.<br><br>‶If you don't mind, next time we come, let's make a day of it,‶ Leisha said.<br><br>Tami paused and said, ‶I'd love that.  The pleasure would be mine.‶<br><br>‶You know that's not true,‶ Jen smiled.<br><br>And now Yvette found herself alone in the kitchen with this naked Tami girl.<br><br>She almost choked on the coffee.  ‶Sorry, I don't realize how strong I make it,‶ Tami said.  Yvette had to load it with milk and sugar to make it drinkable.<br><br>‶This is a 'safe home',‶ Tami said.  ‶I'm supposed to take you to the help center here, part of the Campbell County Social Services department.  I'm in no hurry, I don't have anywhere to go till ten.‶  She paused as if for effect.  ‶You don't have to talk to me, but I am here to listen if you do.  I'll keep it a secret if you say so.‶  Another pause.  Tami began to stretch, her breasts jutting out, then seemed to check herself.  She stretched out one leg and rested the bare heel on the far corner of the table.  ‶You were quite a mess last night.  I heard you threw up on stage.‶<br><br>‶I almost threw up on you too, when you picked me off the ground.‶<br><br>‶Actually you did.‶<br><br>‶Oh -- I'm so sorry.‶<br><br>Tami smiled.  ‶It's O.K.  It's happened to me before.‶<br><br>Yvette sipped and thought.  ‶I miss my boyfriend.‶<br><br>‶What's his name?‶<br><br>‶Pierre.  He got me this job and then we had a fight.‶<br><br>‶Where is he now?‶<br><br>‶Ste. Catherine.  He biked there yesterday.‶<br><br>‶Quebec.‶<br><br>Yvette ventured a smile.  ‶Oui.‶<br><br>‶Sorry, my French is poor.  That's 'ja', right?‶<br><br>‶No, I think it's 'si'.‶  Yvette hadn't used this knowledge since high school.  She suddenly remembered her mother saying, ‶You're smarter than you think you are.‶<br><br>‶Funny, I thought it was 'da'.‶<br><br>The two young women giggled.  Yvette's first giggle in a long time.<br><br>After a quiet moment Tami said, ‶You like that job?  At Teaser's?‶<br><br>‶There's nothing wrong with being a dancer.  The pay is good and it's safe,‶ Yvette said defensively.<br><br>Tami looked as if she'd heard that a thousand times before.  Then she took a deep breath.  ‶I didn't mean to sound, like, judgmental.  A lot of girls from there seem weirded out.  Others are O.K.  Or so I've heard.  I've never actually been there.‶<br><br>Yvette looked at the bareness of Tami's breasts and did not know what to think.<br><br>‶Do you want to talk more about it?‶<br><br>At the risk of being impolite to her host, Yvette said, ‶No.  Sorry.  No.‶  She wondered about calling Pierre.  No, it would be long distance from this phone.  Also impolite.<br><br>‶Well then let's get going.‶  Tami got the keys that were hanging from the doorway.  Yvette got up and followed her, with another twinge of disbelief.  Surely she wasn't going outside in the winter -- like that??  There were no coats or boots in the doorway.<br><br>Tami opened the door and a gust of cold air hit Yvette.  She shivered in her camisole.<br><br>Tami turned and put her hands on Yvette's shoulders.  Yvette looked down at the tanned perfect body.  Tami looked at the camisole, the vinyl pants, the sockless feet in platform sandals.<br><br>‶The first thing to do,‶ the naked girl said, ‶is to get you into some decent clothes.‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 4", content: "In the driveway, next to the tracks in the snow left by Rod's jeep, was an old, old yellow Volkswagen Beetle.  Yvette, freezing in the doorway, watched in astonishment as Tami, holding up the key chain with one hand to separate out the correct key, walked over to it slowly and casually, bare feet slopping through the slushy snow covered with two inches of fluffy powder from last night.  As she got to the driver's side she called back.  ‶C'mon, Yvette.  You'll be O.K.  It's all in the mind.  Besides, it's a real short ride.‶<br><br>It was a bright morning.  The new snow was almost blinding.  Yvette looked both ways, wondering if anyone saw this crazy naked girl, then rushed into the car.<br><br>She watched silently as Tami pumped the gas, bare toes curling over the padless metal that must feel colder than ice.  Her breasts jiggled as she pulled the manual choke -- this was a really old model, like her grandfather used to have in Abitibi.  Then Tami got out to the rear, opened the hood, and threw some kind of switch that got the motor to reluctantly kick over.<br><br>‶Six volt system,‶ she explained as bare buns settled back onto the ripped vinyl of the driver's seat.  ‶The juice doesn't carry in the cold, so I had to put in a bypass on the fan shroud.‶<br><br>Yvette nodded like she knew what Tami was talking about.  And then the old car lurched into action.<br><br>‶Whoaa!‶ Yvette cried out as it swerved along the driveway, steadily propelled from behind but with the destination of the front end more uncertain.  Tami swung the steering wheel back and forth like it was a bumper car in an amusement park.  Yvette didn't feel in danger.  This was fun.  Tami laughed.  ‶VW's are great in the snow.  That's why I got this one.‶<br><br>Yvette was hoping for some heat, but then remembered that her grandfather's car was always cold.  As they came to a stop sign she looked at the blank knobs on the dashboard.  ‶Is there heat?‶<br><br>‶Theoretical heat, but not real.  This has a stale air system.  It's O.K., you don't really need heat in a car, unless you're on a long ride.‶  Yvette did not ask what this naked girl did for long rides.<br><br>Now they turned onto what looked like the main street.  Yvette had never been in the center of this town; Teaser's was on the outskirts.  She looked around to see if anyone was noticing Tami's bareness.  The tops of her breasts, at least, would be showing.  But now a professor-looking type on the sidewalk waved at her.  And a young couple carrying bookbags.  Now, an old lady toting a cart with groceries.  Tami waved back cheerfully to each.<br><br>Yvette smiled.  ‶Everyone seems to know you.‶<br><br>‶I've been here almost the whole four years.‶  Then she turned closer to Yvette's face.  ‶Also, I'm easy to recognize.‶<br><br>They pulled up to a church.  Good God!  Is she going to walk naked into --<br><br>When they got out it turned out they were actually going into a small clapboard house next to the church.  A knock on the door and . . .<br><br>It was Rev. Josiah Stipend, a tall and strong-looking man in a rumpled minister's suit with gray hair almost covering his collar.  ‶Welcome, Miss Tami,‶ he said, not in a Southern accent, but in that lilt that Baptist preachers sometimes have.<br><br>‶Good morning Reverend,‶ Tami said respectfully but amiably.  ‶This young woman stayed with me last night.  Her name is Yvette.  She could use some clothes.‶<br><br>The reverend nodded at Tami for a long second, then without looking below either woman's face, led them in a gentlemanly manner through a hallway, down some stairs, and into what looked like it might have originally been the house's garage.  Aisles of donated clothes and shoes beckoned, so narrow that there was hardly room to get through.<br><br>A middle-aged woman, a kerchief holding back her hair, sat nearby sorting clothes on a low table.  Behind her was a washer and dryer.  ‶Hi Tami.‶<br><br>‶Hi Mrs. Stipend.‶<br><br>Tami led her guest into the aisles, obviously knowing how the place was organized.  ‶First you'll need some real pants . . .‶<br><br>The Stipends looked at each other and then at the nakedness among the clothes.  Rev. Stipend could not help reflecting on his past experience with Tami.  He used to be a real firebrand, one of the hellfire members of the college Scholarship Committee.  He could not forget the committee's visit to the Dixon Mill to see Tami at her grounds crew assignment, her sweating nakedness on display as her bare feet trod the blades of that awful double treadmill.  How he had berated her sinfulness then, and also later when she was summoned to appear before the committee in those special bra and panties which contained protrusions invading her inner cavities, bringing her to climax after climax while being forced to answer their questions.<br><br>It was only later that he found out that she was a modest girl who did not want to be naked, and who had been forced into that escalating series of humiliations by Dean Jorgon and Henry Ross who were trying to get her to renounce her scholarship.  And that, after Jorgon had resigned and Ross had disappeared and the whole injustice came to light, she discovered she had developed an allergy to clothes and shoes of any type.<br><br>What remarkable iron within those young features!  He wrote her a letter of apology but knew that was not enough.  He prayed for several nights trying to find forgiveness.  Finally he met with her in the faculty lounge and asked her forgiveness in person.  For a person of his pride it was not easy.  She said nothing for a long moment, and then to his surprise she embraced him tearfully.<br><br>That experience profoundly changed him.  Also, events in the outside world over the past couple of years had convinced him that fundamentalism was perhaps not the way to go.  Fortunately most of his congregation followed him as he edged leftward.  The lengthening hair was but a trivial sign of it.  He peppered his sermons less and less with condemnation and more and more with social justice and compassion.  It turned out not to be that hard.  Support in scripture was certainly easy to find.<br><br>The idea that came to him to set up a clothing closet had such an obvious and questionable origin that he resisted it for a while, but it was simply the right thing to do.  In this often cold climate there were many poor people, not so much in town but in the surrounding area, that would benefit.  He was aware why he got the idea, through his partial embrace of Freud.  Herr Remmler's mentor had made some penetrating observations.  Rev. Stipend wanted most of all to give Tami Smithers clothes.  Setting up the closet was a sublimation of that desire.  Sublimation, he now knew, sometimes had its uses.<br><br>Tami and Yvette emerged from the aisles, Yvette carrying jeans, a coat, a flannel shirt, and tall leather boots.  Tami carried a furry, Russian-style hat.<br><br>‶You can take more,‶ he said, then realized he was actually talking to Tami.  What a cross she had to bear.  Yet she carried it almost joyfully.<br><br>Tami seemed about to turn back, then said, ‶No, this will do.  Thank you.‶<br><br>‶Any time, my dear -- Tami.‶<br><br>Going back to the car, Yvette remarked, ‶For a cleric he is a nice man.‶  Tami laughed.<br><br>Another quick jaunt in Tami's cold little metal crate and they were back at the house.  Tami sent Yvette into the shower.<br><br>Yvette came out wrapped in a towel, with another around her hair.  ‶Come over here.‶  She followed the voice to the master bedroom where Tami had her ‶new‶ clothes laid out on the now completely made-up bed.  Tami was rummaging through a drawer.  As she bent over with a total lack of bashfulness, the brown asterisk of her butthole was almost in Yvette's face.  Yvette tried not to look.<br><br>‶You probably want some socks under those boots,‶ Tami said.  ‶Rod has some extras.  Sorry I don't have any women's underwear.‶<br><br>‶No?‶<br><br>‶No.  I don't own any clothes of course. . . I'll be in the kitchen, calling the help center.‶<br><br>Yvette took her time with dressing.  She couldn't help but smile as she presented herself to Tami in the kitchen.  Though second-hand, the shirt, jeans, the coat, even the Russian hat, looked very good on her.  This Tami had excellent fashion sense.<br><br>She felt like a little girl getting ready for a party as Tami fussed over the blouse and the coat.  Absently looking at the jiggling bare nipples, she said, ‶Tami, your body is most fine.  You could make a million dollars dancing on the circuit.‶<br><br>At this her clothesless host just smiled.<br><br>A few minutes later, the old VW, back in town, parked on the main street.  They were about to get out and Yvette, sensing their time together was about to end, could not resist asking.  ‶Tami.  How can you stand being without clothes in this weather so cold?‶<br><br>‶It's mostly in the mind,‶ Tami replied, as if having been asked this question many times and having rehearsed and refined the answer.  ‶To some extent my body has gotten used to it.  In the cold weather I eat like a pig and my metabolism is higher.  Of course I can't stay out for, like, hours or anything like that.  Or if it's super-cold.  Keeping moving is important.‶<br><br>‶How long have you been like this?‶<br><br>‶This is my fourth winter.  The first one was rough.  The second one, I kept testing my limits, seeing what was possible.  By the third winter, I knew how to handle the cold so automatically, that I hardly thought about it.‶<br><br>They were getting out of the car now.  A tall woman in stylishly bohemian clothes and stiletto heel boots stopped by.  Next to her was a much older woman with a cane, in a big fake-fur coat and a green flowery hat.<br><br>‶Hi, Tami,‶ Assistant Dean Vanessa Congi said.<br><br>‶Hello dear,‶ the lady in the green hat, Professor Emeritus Mildred George, said in her scratchy old voice.<br><br>‶This is my friend Yvette,‶ Tami said graciously as she shuffled around the back of the Beetle to turn off the bypass switch.  Yvette shook hands with each, a little ladylike clasp.  As the naked girl came around to where they were, Professor Congi said, ‶That's a beautiful shade of hair, Tami.‶<br><br>‶Oh thanks.‶  Tami looked down at her pubic patch.  This made Yvette half cover her eyes.<br><br>‶I see your nails all match your hair color,‶ Mrs. George said admiringly.<br><br>‶I did them myself.‶<br><br>‶It looks professional.‶<br><br>‶Gee thanks,‶ Tami said, blushing over and above the usual flush from the cold.  As they looked down she lifted a foot and spread her toes.  The plum-colored toenails, graced with crystals of fresh snow, sparkled in the bright morning sun, a strange and beautiful sight.<br><br>Professor Congi looked a bit further up.  ‶Did you also color your clitoris?‶  She remembered what Tami had been like as a sophomore.<br><br>‶No,‶ Tami laughed, looking down there with the rest of them.  She spread her labia with her thumbs.  ‶That's just my lips.  See, on cold days she stays inside.‶  The little pink clitoris, lighter in color than the lips or the hair, poked out wetly and tentatively in the cold brightness as the two older women, bundled in their winter clothes and boots, looked appreciatively, Mrs. George leaning on her cane.<br><br>‶Hi!‶ Professor said playfully with a little wave.<br><br>‶Hi hi,‶ Tami said in a high-pitched singsong, with little jerks of her internal muscles making the clit jump up and down twice.  The older women got quite a kick out of that.<br><br>Yvette, feeling faint, stood up and looked at the blue sky and took a deep breath.  After some minor chit-chat the two grown-ups left.<br><br>As they were getting Yvette's bag out of the car, her mind returned to the main subject of her curiosity.  ‶And this fourth winter?‶<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶You said how you dealt with going through the first three winters.  This is your fourth.  How is it?‶<br><br>‶Well,‶ Tami said, standing next to her.  ‶Now -- it's -- fun!!‶<br><br>She kicked snow up with her toes, pressed it down on the other foot, then all in the same motion with a soccer player's skill kicked the little snowball right into Yvette's face just as she said ‶fun‶!<br><br>‶Eeeek!‶  Yvette brushed it away but it was followed by another.  She ran behind the car, laughing, and decided retaliation was necessary.  When she emerged a big sloppy snowball hit Tami right on her tanned concave tummy.  This elicited a left-handed curveball that hit the shoulder of her coat.<br><br>The two young women ran around and around the Beetle, Yvette clumping around in her boots, bits of snow flying back from Tami's toes.  It was not a fair fight, of course.  Tami seemed to be a natural pitcher, and could produce an ‶eeek!‶ whenever she hit Yvette's face or neck.  Landing snowballs on Tami's naked skin, already used to the cold, did not have the same effect.<br><br>The Quebecois girl was flushed and disheveled when Tami brought her into the help center, but was cheerful and smiling which would make her easier for the case manager to work with.  ‶Thank you, thank you, merci,‶ was all Yvette could say as she said goodbye to her naked new friend, hugging her tightly, enjoying the soft feel of the breasts crushed against her coat, and even betraying a sniffle or two, only partly from having been out in the cold." },
      { title: "Chapter 5", content: "‶I have come into your life to redeem your image of bio majors,‶ said Gretchen, a tall, blonde, blue-eyed, somewhat chunky girl Tami's age.  ‶We are not all dweebs.  We are not all virgins.  We do not all spend our time trying to make Tami Smithers miserable with fourth-grader antics.  In fact, most of us are not any of that.‶<br><br>Gretchen had made this declaration to Tami three years ago during their freshman year, sharing a salad in the dining hall after a particularly odious episode of abuse from Gretchen's classmate Lorinda and her friends.  On that occasion Tami, having been outfitted for the day with the bristle bra and dildo panties ostensibly for scientific purposes, defended Gretchen against chatter that was too loud not to be overheard, spreading their opinion to half the world that Gretchen had faked a sprained ankle to avoid a big exam.  Standing in the middle of the circle of dweeby girls outside the bio building on a gray spring day, the 18-year-old Tami labored to articulate her protest amidst the internal frictionings and vibrations activated by the remote controls that had somehow made their way into their hands.<br><br>Gretchen, hobbling unnoticed toward them on crutches, would never forget the scene.  ‶She's -- ohhh! -- more dedicated than you -- ohhh -- will ever -- beeeee!!!!!‶  The girls squealed with delight as the last word stretched out under the influence of the vibrations and bristlings as Tami crested.  ‶Woo hoo!  Another one!  Up to fifteen!‶ said Betsy, reading the LCD display on the tiny pubic covering.  ‶Come again, baby!!‶ Lorinda joined in, immediately renewing the assault.  Tami's body bounced up and down like a marionette, her feet slapping crazily on the cold concrete, as they coordinated their attack, sliding the rheostats up and down in unison and enjoying Tami's words cadencing up and down accordingly.  ‶You are acting so -- imm -- mm -- mature . . . If she d - didn't have to g - go to the same class she wouldn't -- OHH!‶ (she arched her back here) ‶have anything to do with youu . . . Kchkk . . .Eeeeeee!‶  Her eyes bugged open as the rear dildo vibrations were shot up to maximum.<br><br>They saw Gretchen and fled.  At the risk of letting her crutch drop the lame girl put her arm around Tami's bare shoulders as her quaking gradually ceased.  When Tami was breathing more or less normally and it seemed none of the dozens of remotes at large were in range, they went to the dining hall, Tami walking stiffly under the influence of the dildos and bristles that still rubbed on her and within her with every step.<br><br>Since then Gretchen, who had been hanging out with Tami but had not gotten close, became a good friend, and after the graduation of Jen and Rebecca and Marisol, probably her best friend on campus.  Tami, without any effort, inspired deep devotion in anyone who got to know her, and Gretchen was no exception.  From a different but equally conservative background as Tami -- Gretchen was from a straight-laced dairy farm family in upstate New York with a fiancé in the Army -- she and Tami put their work ethics and majors together and developed a joint term project, developing a biodegradable polymer from which fabric could hopefully be made that both insulated against cold and breathed in the heat.<br><br>So it was that they could be found together, at 10:30 a.m., in the biochem lab in Rockley Hall.  Gretchen, in goggles and an apron, had poured the contents of a test tube onto the aluminum substrate.  Tami, holding her goggles up to her eyes because her allergy did not allow her to put the straps around her head, watched from behind, glancing downward to make sure her feet were not touching anything on the floor that looked like a chemical stain.<br><br>The solution partially dried on the aluminum amid a slight cloud of smoke.<br><br>‶We're getting there,‶ Gretchen said.<br><br>‶Do you think my nucleotide formula was correct?‶<br><br>‶I assume so.  Your calculus is a lot better than mine.‶<br><br>‶Maybe we need less alkyne,‶ Tami said.<br><br>The solution was supposed to dry almost immediately, then be rolled into a thread for weaving.  This was the third try and they were getting close.  Their professors had already given them an A for the project but both had further ambitions for it.<br><br>Tami looked at the clock and smiled.  ‶It's almost showtime.‶<br><br>Gretchen smiled behind the goggles.  ‶You're really making me go through with this, right?‶<br><br>After cleanup they were on their way to Thayer Hall, where the ‶Department of Fashion Technology‶ classes were held.  Professor Wanamaker, looking quite the denizen of the fashion world with his ascot and paisley shirt, sat in the back of one of the basement classrooms while his Reinventing Fashion class did their midterm in-class reports.<br><br>There were three scheduled today.  Tami, who was only minoring in Fashion but, being Tami, was headed for an A, was first up.<br><br>Bracing her hands behind her on the front table where her papers lay, Tami stood bolt upright in front of the class, giving them an unembarrassed full frontal view of her statuesque nakedness.  Her topic: measuring bra size.<br><br>‶My, uh, project is on a very basic topic, but I think one that maybe could be done better.‶  Tami had little trouble with public speaking, having been Vice President of the student government in her sophomore year.  ‶I think you girls, anyway, could identify. I remember --‶  she looked up at the ceiling, maybe a bit uneasily, her big toe twisting onto the dusty tile floor, ‶buying a bra that I was sure was the right size, only to get home and it was, like, too tight, or else I was swimming around in it.  Or maybe, did you ever,‶ she said, looking at a couple of the female students toward the front, ‶maybe you hadn't eaten all day, and your, uh, breasts‶ (one could tell that in this classroom setting she had stopped herself from saying ‶boobs‶) ‶were far apart, like this‶ -- she looked down and, cupping her breasts, separated them -- ‶and the bra didn't bring them together, or if you ate a lot of pizza or something, they were bigger and more mooshed together‶ -- the ideal model for what she was talking about, Tami compressed her breasts so that they met -- ‶and the bra pulled them apart?‶<br><br>Some sounds of agreement and nodding from the female students.  There were three male students, and being gay they were less interested, but polite.  Tami was popular with them too.<br><br>Wanamaker said, ‶So what is your solution, Tami?‶  Tami didn't need it but, after years of seeing students freeze up while giving oral reports, he automatically interjected to help things along.<br><br>Turning around to pick up the papers, giving the class a view of her beautifully formed butt, Tami turned back to say, ‶The problem arises from the, uh, conventional method of measuring bust size.  Look at page 137 of the Basics of Design text.‶<br><br>They could all see a slight sheen of sweat on Tami's face and her concave tummy, but this was not due to nervousness.  It was well known that in the winter Tami, with her increased metabolism, often felt hot after spending some time indoors.  Also this basement room was stuffy.  Tami looked at Claire in the back row.  ‶Claire, could you read the first step in that list, on the left?‶<br><br>Claire, a very thin Asian girl in a silk puff-sleeve blouse, white jeans and high-heel black boots, found the page and said, ‶You mean where it says measure rib cage, then across nipples?‶<br><br>‶No, before that.  The first step.‶<br><br>‶O.K.  'Step One.  Stand upright in a bra that fits correctly.'‶<br><br>She looked up at Tami who had a little smile on her face.  It sank in quickly.  Wanamaker laughed and so did some others.  With a big smile Tami said, ‶Now how it tells you how to measure the rib cage and across the nipples, but first you have to wear a bra that fits.‶  She was a little animated now, moving her hands, her breasts jiggling.  ‶It's like the joke about the germ killer that says, 'use only in well-ventilated area'.  But if it was well ventilated, there wouldn't be germs in the first place.<br><br>‶My solution involves some calculus,‶ she said, turning to the blackboard, making some of the students groan.  Wanamaker good-naturedly said, ‶O.K., people.‶  As she wrote Tami held the papers in her right hand, her butt jiggling ever so slightly, quarter-phase glimpses of her bouncing breasts sometimes being seen.  She was drawing a section of a cone, some curves, an integral... ‶Make it understandable, Tami.  I don't want to clip your wings but we've never had a math major in this class before.‶<br><br>Tami got into the explanation of it and most of the class could partly understand, or thought they did.  ‶My model is that of a parabola.  Almost all women have breasts that can be fitted into parabolic cups.  I made some computer models.‶<br><br>The room went dark and the big screen to the side lit up.  A purple torso with two blue parabolic solids jutting out with some equations on the bottom in a neutral font.  ‶Ooooo,‶ someone said teasingly.  ‶Finally, someone uses our new flat-screen,‶ Wanamaker said.<br><br>‶This is the paraboloid of a C cup.  And now, D, and double D, or E in the British system.  Here's B and A.‶  A few more images and Tami darted to her right and turned the lights back on.  ‶You can see that, with the breasts free and not wearing a bra, the cross-nipple measurement is plugged into the parabolic formula, and you translate that into cup size.‶<br><br>‶How do you know this would be comfortable for all women?‶  Wanamaker said.<br><br>‶Breasts are more pliable than even a lot women think, at least I believe so.  I'll show you.‶  Tami walked forward so that she was between the two students in the front row.  ‶This would be a spherical model,‶ she said, grasping her breasts from the front with her palms almost flat against the nipples.  ‶From there you can go to the paraboloid, then the hyperboloid.‶  She cupped her hands around her breasts, then squeezed a slight bit and then a bit more.  ‶Finally there is the cone shape.‶  She squeezed now so that her nipples were sticking out.  ‶This was the 'bullet bra' from the 1950's.‶  She stood in profile, both hands on one breast now, squeezing toward the base with one while the other pulled out on the nipple, extending out from her body quite a ways.<br><br>‶And those were very uncomfortable, I hear,‶ Wanamaker said.<br><br>‶But that's because of the materials used, which were specifically designed to extend the shape.  If the softer fabrics are used, and of course, if the bra size was measured correctly to begin with...‶<br><br>‶It sure looks like you're squeezing your tits out,‶ another girl said, then looked back at the professor.  ‶Sorry about the language, but it looks painful.‶<br><br>‶I ask everyone to try it, all you women, next time you're in the shower,‶ their naked classmate said.  ‶It's not as bad as you think.‶<br><br>Wanamaker thought of saying, ‶All I can think of is B & D pornography, where women get their breasts tied up and clipped,‶ but of course he didn't.  As a heterosexual male, he had a fascination with breasts that practically no one else in his field shared.<br><br>‶Anyway,‶ Tami said, ‶we're not talking about conical projections, like that bra Madonna wore in the '90's.  They would not be a good idea anyway just before you're period when you naturally have lumps, especially around here,‶ she said, lifting her arm and tracing the side of the mound under her shaved armpit.  ‶My model is with paraboloids.  And now, my real life model,‶ Tami said.<br><br>Gretchen, leaving her coat on the chair, got up from her place near the door.  Protectively draped in her white sweater, she bashfully folded her arms in front of her as she stood next to Tami, a tall girl slouching, looking down at her uneasy suede boots next to Tami's confident bare feet.<br><br>‶Gretchen is a bio major who graciously, uh, I mean was cajoled, into serving as my guinea pig.  Now up here on the screen, these are CG fill-ins -- NOT photos, I'll have you know -- of her breasts.  Note the measurements, plugged into the formula, and it shows she's a 38C.  Now here is an actual photo of her wearing the cotton turtleneck she's got on now. . . Of course, now she has a sweater over it.  Note the bulging on top in the photo.  Though she measured herself in the standard fashion, it came out to 38B and the bra did not fit.‶<br><br>The lights were on again and Tami and Gretchen looked at each other.  ‶I can tell you're nervous,‶ Tami said, glancing down slightly at her own erect brown nipples that had sensitivities well beyond being able to predict the weather.<br><br>As Gretchen bit her lip and took off her sweater, Tami said, ‶Here she is wearing a paraboloid bra I cobbled together in the dress lab, 38C.  Come on, stick 'em out,‶ she teased.<br><br>Gretchen took a deep breath and stood up straight, all five feet eleven inches of her, and turned this way and that.  Her breasts stood out proud and paraboloid.  No bulges or straps were visible.<br><br>‶It looks excellent,‶ Wanamaker said.  ‶Very nice lines.‶<br><br>‶Great set of guns, wouldn't you say?‶ Tami said.<br><br>The class laughed, and for a second Gretchen swayed this way and that, like a runway model.  Then her upbringing kicked back in and she turned to snatch her sweater and slip it back on.<br><br>‶That concludes my presentation,‶ Tami said, gathering her papers.  Gretchen scurried back to her seat.<br><br>‶Thanks, Tami,‶ Wanamaker said, but before Tami could sit down he added, ‶Let me say, that's beautiful hair color you've picked.‶<br><br>‶Oh thanks.‶  She looked down modestly, separating her legs slightly, pushing her pubic patch forward and placing her hands on both sides of it as if to frame it.  ‶It's called 'Plum'.‶<br><br>Wanamaker was at a momentary loss.  He had been referring to the hair on her head.  But it was the same color so he let it go.  Besides, come to think of it it looked good down there too.<br><br>After Tami sat down the professor, sitting in the back, used a few seconds of silence as most good professors know how to do.  ‶Thanks, Gretchen, for helping out, and good to meet you... Tami Smithers: A, as usual.  Good project, very inventive.‶  A few people clapped.  ‶Now the next, Claire, you're up...‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 6", content: "Scholar's, the bar the Campbell-Frank students went to, or at least those who were of drinking age, was hopping tonight.  It was packed despite the trouble one had negotiating the frozen slush that made the sidewalk an obstacle course.  The people having a smoke outside stood perfectly still so as not to lose their balance and slip as they chatted with each other.  Bill Patton and Howie, his old high school buddy who was visiting from Dartmouth, waited patiently to present their proof of age and get the backs of their hands stamped.<br><br>‶Are you sure she's here?‶<br><br>‶Pretty sure.  70 percent sure.  Friday nights all the regulars are here,‶ Bill said.<br><br>Inside it was very loud.  Oldies night.  Nirvana tunes blasting away, and everybody talking loud to be heard over the tunes.  It was hard to see more than two feet in front, with all the people.  ‶Hey Bob,‶ Bill said, suddenly colliding with a friend from the dorm.  He introduced Howie and they got to chatting, or rather yelling.<br><br>‶So is Tami here?‶  Bill didn't know her personally but everyone called her ‶Tami‶, except those close to her that might have more endearing names.  It used to be ‶Naked Tami‶, but with her popularity, it got shortened.<br><br>‶Saw her a minute ago,‶ Bob said, pointing thataway with the top of his longneck Budweiser.  ‶You have to keep a sharp eye.‶<br><br>Bill knew that well.  The eyes of half the guys in the bar were glancing here and there, looking for that glimpse of bare skin that was so conspicuous in this crowd of parkas and overcoats. Others looked downward, looking for the flash of bare feet darting through the thick forest of boots and sneakers.  Tami, being unburdened by any of these, could slip quickly through the crowd with ease, and slip across the entire bar within seconds, making her all that more elusive.<br><br>These Tami-watchers, dedicated as bird-watchers trying to sight a rare jaybird, suddenly found their efforts unnecessary as Tami hopped up onto the bar.  Standing upright, longneck in her hand, she naturally attracted everyone's attention.  The whole bar cheered, because she was Tami, the guys also cheering because, well, she was a naked girl.<br><br>She stretched her lips over her teeth and whistled loudly.  Then took a sip of beer as Justin, the bartender, cut the music as planned.<br><br>‶Attention everyone,‶ she said.  ‶I will now sit on this bottle.  Just kidding!!‶  A loud chorus of, ‶Awwwww!!‶ from the guys.  ‶No really, we have an alumna, or alumnae, or -- some kind of alumnimunim,‶ another sip, ‶who just got a job as prosecutor in the Boston D.A. office and I want to dedicate a song to her.  It's... it's...‶<br><br>‶Who -- is -- it?‶ a number of people shouted in unison.<br><br>‶Wandabitch!!‶ Tami shouted, breasts bobbing, then she pointed her bottle down at Wanda Percival, looking not quite like a prosecutor in her sweatshirt, parka and jeans, hefting a bottle of cola.  Tami bent down, in the process shaking her butt at some guys on the side who reflexively whistled, and pulled Wanda up onto the bar.  Wanda clumped up onto it in her hiking boots.<br><br>The naked girl and the new prosecutor faced the crowd.  Tami grabbed Wanda by the shoulder of the parka, and said, ‶You remember Wandabitch.  Let's hear it!‶<br><br>Indeed they did, or at least the juniors and seniors.  The chant was spontaneous.  ‶Wanda-bitch!  Wanda-bitch!  Wanda-bitch!‶<br><br>When it died down a bit Tami said, ‶The meanest, most vicious, rottenest R.A. in Campbell-Frank history‶ -- she looked at Wanda as she said this and then put her arm around her -- ‶is now the meanest, most vicious, rottenest D.A. in New England.  Don't mess with Wanda!!‶<br><br>‶Booooo!!‶  The boos were good-natured (mostly).<br><br>‶There's only one song for you.  I dedicate this to Wandabitch.  We love you!!  BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT HERE ANYMORE!!‶<br><br>She had to shout over the first notes of ‶Bad to the Bone‶ that now blasted out.  As the song went on and everyone went back to talking, the two young women hugged, Wanda wrapping the arm of her fur-lined parka around the small of Tami's bare back.  Both were a little bit teary-eyed.<br><br>Bill, Howie and Bob, having had a nice view of Tami to hold them for awhile, circulated around the bar.  A few minutes later Bob saw a flash of skin and happened upon Wanda and Tami speaking to a couple of others.<br><br>‶Where are you going to live?‶ Bob shouted to Wanda.  He glanced at Tami who was casually lifting her foot and turning the sole inward to check it.  Must really be disgusting, walking barefoot on this sticky, beery floor.  Sure enough, Tami's sole was black except under the arch.  She put her foot down again, not seeming to mind.  Probably she's used to it, just like she's used to the snow and the cold.<br><br>Wanda shouted, ‶Back Bay, probably.  Or maybe Comm Ave just near BU.‶<br><br>Bob, not having known Wanda well, was not really interested in this conversation; he just wanted to look at Tami.  But out-and-out gawking at Tami was simply not done.  Any Campbell-Frank guy would find that out pretty quickly.  After a few more words he said goodbye and went to find Howie and Bill.<br><br>Talk, shout, drink.  About ten minutes later Bob finally found them, near the benches, watching what was a frequent sight at Scholar's.  Tami, leaning back on a bench, was facing some girl who was sitting opposite with her long-lace boots planted in front of her.  Tami was doing that trick of undoing and tying shoes with her toes.  Arms draped behind her on the bench, one hand still grasping the longneck, Tami leaned back with her thighs wide open and her knees bent, skillfully lacing and looping the girl's boots from the bottom up.  She paused to take another sip and then resumed.  It looked like she was using all her toes.<br><br>Some, mostly guys, chose to stand behind the shod girl, facing Tami and studying the ripples of her abs as she worked, the wiggling of her breasts, the pussy that was slightly open between the wide-spread legs.<br><br>‶Man, how does she do that??‶ Howie said.<br><br>‶Practice, she can do anything with her feet,‶ Bill said.<br><br>Bob took a thoughtful sip and said, ‶Being barefoot for four years, she probably just learned to use them.  You could probably do it too with practice.‶<br><br>Bill said, ‶Howie?  I think I'll pass on seeing that.‶<br><br>They laughed.<br><br>Now the first girl's boots were all tied and people clapped.  Another girl, this one with sneakers, took her place.  Tami's big toes, anchored by her pinky toes, undid the big loops and she got to work.  Tami could do this on almost any kind of footwear, even after three beers.<br><br>The last glimpse Bob, Bill and Howie had of Tami that night was after they had left the bar and were walking back to campus.  They only made it about a hundred feet from the bar when Bill suddenly felt the pressure of a full bladder.  Drinking a lot of beer and then going out into subfreezing air will do that.  Bob and Howie stood around in the middle of the snow-covered town commons as Bill hunted through the tall shrubs for an inconspicuous spot.<br><br>As they waited they saw Tami with Wanda and another girl standing some distance away, near the convenience store.  The three were apparently waiting for someone to come out.  The other girl was smoking.  Tami, arms at her sides, listened to the smoking girl, now and then rubbing her feet on the snow and lifting her soles inward to check them, tilting them just so to take advantage of the nearby streetlight.<br><br>It was the kind of still winter night when sound carries.  So as not to be overheard, Bob and Howie spoke in quiet voices much unlike the yelling of a few minutes ago.  ‶How does she do that?‶ Howie said.  ‶She's standing there naked like it's not even cold.‶  He blew on his hands.  ‶Just my hands are freezing already!‶<br><br>‶She must have got used to it.  For a few minutes, anyway.‶<br><br>‶She's married?‶<br><br>‶Yup.  And totally faithful.  Don't even think about it.  She'd kick your ass if you tried anything.  I hear she's real strong.‶<br><br>‶When she said she was going to sit on that beer bottle, for a second I believed her,‶ Howie laughed.<br><br>‶Oh man,‶ Bob said, looking at the sky.  ‶I hear with her friends she does that kind of thing on a dare, especially if she's had a few.  I heard one time at an outdoor party, I think a birthday for one of her friends; she upended some beer into her pussy, then sat up, spread her legs, and squirted it out clear across the lawn.‶<br><br>‶Holy Christ.  Think of the muscles in there!  Her husband must be the luckiest guy in the world!‶<br><br>‶I'll say.  Or maybe not.  I'd be worried about her squeezing my dick off!‶<br><br>Howie laughed.  ‶So what's the story with her being naked again?  She's allergic to clothes or something?‶<br><br>‶She said nudism was her religion when she was a freshman. She must have been a crazy kid then.  Later she volunteered for some experiments, then at the end she found out she was allergic to clothes.  They've been doing therapy to cure it ever since.‶<br><br>Howie was speechless for a moment.  ‶Man, I should hope so.  She should sue the hell out of them for that.‶<br><br>‶That's the big mystery.  Why she never sued.  I suppose she wants to leave it in the past.‶<br><br>The girl with the cigarette dropped it in the snow and stamped it out.  A guy came out of the convenience store.  Tami, walking slowly and casually over the crusty, refrozen snow, followed them into his car.<br><br>Bill, sighing deeply, came back from the shrubs.  He caught the last glimpse of Tami's bare soles disappearing into the back seat of the blue Chevy.<br><br>‶Damn, missed her,‶ Bill said, adjusting his fly.<br><br>‶She might want to leave it in the past,‶ Howie said, ‶but she's a senior now.  What's she going to do when she graduates?  Is she going to stay here forever?‶<br><br>‶It would be rough, going into the outside world as a naked girl,‶ Bob said, his voice fading into the cold winter night as the three of them started on back toward campus." },
      { title: "Chapter 7", content: "Tami looked so beautiful, her eyes half-closed in that combination of love and ecstasy, the look she always had when she was atop him.  Rod gently rubbed her forearms up and down as her breath shortened and she began another ascent -- ‶going up‶ to that mountaintop of euphoria that she visited so often.<br><br>She knew he was a little tired tonight.  So preoccupied with work.  He was grateful to get home, and they did the usual thing, him tonguing her while she lay back on the kitchen table.  It didn't take much tongue work, fortunately.  He brought her to four orgasms in fifteen minutes, about the usual to hold her through supper.  He declined her offer to suck him, fearing that after he came he would fall asleep when he had so much work to do.  Then they cooked up a quick macaroni and cheese.  Tami further fortified herself with a tuna sandwich.  And a bowl of soup.<br><br>They spent the next two hours working, he in bed going over the plans for the next phase of the project that he was supposed to supervise, she on the computer finishing an English Literature paper.  English was not her favorite subject; she was sometimes afraid of the unthinkable, getting a B, but of course that possibility was remote.  Looking up at her at the computer table, he couldn't help but fall in love all over again despite his weariness.  Such a lovely, intelligent face, such a beautiful, golden body... He did not mind that so many others admired it, it made him proud.  He especially liked her response to the many well-intentioned suggestions that she get a tattoo.  ‶Absolutely not.  A tattoo would be on display all the time.  It would be a message to everyone who saw me.‶  Why ruin such perfection?<br><br>She still had the basic modesty that she always had, but had gotten comfortable with her nudity.  Of course -- she had no choice, did she?  She expressed it once to him during one of their post-sex chats.  They were lying on their backs, looking up at the ceiling, holding hands.  ‶I had a dream once where I was a serving maid for a king in a palace and I was naked all the time.  All the other maids were fully clothed.  For some reason I had to earn my clothes back.  The king and his rich friends kept visiting me in the kitchen, or walking by when I was mopping the palace floor or something, saying, 'All you have to do is this floor, or be a good server at the next feast, and you'll get your clothes and shoes back.'  And I was ever so industrious, saying to the other maids, 'All I got to do is this job,' and when it got done the king would say, 'Just one more thing and you'll get clothes', and give me another task, while the other maids just rolled their eyes at my stupidity.  All those men really wanted to do was look at my body, stringing me along.  Well, f**k that.  I'm not going to be that stupid.‶<br><br>That was only the second time he ever heard her use the ‶f‶ word.  ‶So how did the dream end?‶<br><br>‶I'm not sure.  I think I just escaped.  Hopped out the window and into the meadow.  Naked and free and smart.  I wasn't going to bargain with God any more.  That was what that dream was about.‶<br><br>Still basically modest, but not above flaunting her body when he was around.  He remembered the graduation party for his class.  It was at a swanky estate the college owned not far away -- formerly lived in by that creep Henry Ross.  Rod was out there on the lakefront patio with the full bar and the buffet table, sipping a soda and trying to stay interested in what his Architectural Design professor was saying.  He glanced around the crowd of students and professors and administrators, wondering where the hell was Tami?<br><br>He looked out to the pond and saw, far away near the marine dock on the other side, a fish or goose or something splashing in the water.  Looking at it more he saw it was not a fish.  It was someone swimming toward them.  As he sipped and looked a smile started across his face and grew and grew.  By the time Tami was a hundred feet away everyone's attention was drawn.<br><br>Like it was nothing, she got to where her feet could touch bottom, then walked up to the transfixed and silent crowd, water coursing off her hair and chin and now her nipples and now her knees, her copper sleek wetness the most beautiful sight of his life.  Casually she hopped her naked dripping self up onto the patio, greeted a couple of people she knew, accepted the offer of a big cloth napkin to quickly dab herself dry, then went up to Rod and gave him a full-body hug and a kiss on the lips.  And then ordered a martini and took her place among the suits and dresses, blending in with the party as the general buzz of conversation gradually returned.  What an entrance!<br><br>Water was definitely her element.  Another vivid memory was last May when he came to meet her when she got off work.  She was on that grounds crew job, the replacement for her gymnastics scholarship.  She probably could have sloughed it off, but being Tami, felt obligated to continue.  So she had always put in her twenty hours a week.  The day had been brutally hot.  Sweating buckets in his suit, he found her hefting uprooted shrubs into a chopper while the chopper driver, union labor no doubt, sat up in his cab.  She grunted with every heave of the heavy shrubs, her body stained with dirt and sweat and leaves.  As always, she had an audience, people stopping for a moment before going on with their business.  When Tami saw Rod and knew her time was up, she said, ‶Hit me Jose!‶  Another worker, walking by past a water pipe, picked up the hose and trained it on her.  She danced and spun around as the water pelted her all over, with her trademark ‶Woo - hoo!‶ as Jose laughed.  One could feel, with some envy, her delicious sense of relief at being clean and cool.  As she put it later, ‶Only I get to experience that!‶<br><br>She was now proud of being naked, though the fact her condition had been forced on her was never mentioned when she was around.  By now it was an open secret around campus that as a freshman she had declared nudity her religion and been cajoled into various research that left her with an allergy to clothes and a greatly increased sex drive.  And that she had spent her first summer making it back from California without clothes or money or outdoor gear, just her bare body.  But not all the details were known, certainly not the more unpleasant ones.  The original reason for her nudity -- that she had been caught streaking on a sorority dare her first week, then to avoid expulsion frantically gave the excuse that nudity was her religion, which turned out to make the college afraid to expel her on First Amendment grounds, causing Dean Jorgon and Henry Ross, the campus attorney, to coerce her into an escalating series of humiliations to get her to admit that the religion claim was a hoax -- had never gotten out.<br><br>As to her family back in Providence, information was tightly controlled.  She was absolutely clear that they should know nothing except for her decision to go naked and her allergy which was being cured.  It would greatly concern her if they found out she had been so mistreated and been through so much shame and abuse.  Even as to that horrible summer, the cover story she had fed her parents during her calls, that she was doing a project for one of her math professors -- they had never learned anything to the contrary.  Fortunately there was little danger her parents would find out anything.  Except for Tami and Rod, they didn't know anyone up here, and on the rare occasions that they spoke to one of her teachers, she would take the teacher aside first to make sure no hints of anything but a happy life leaked out.<br><br>Her current life really was happy though.  One time a half-drunk guy at a party told her, ‶Too bad you can't wear clothes.‶  Rod felt about to slug him when Tami, draining her beer, said, ‶Too bad you can't be naked.‶<br><br>Professor Congi, always well-meaning if a bit dense, once asked her, on a hot sunny day outside the Student Union, ‶There are probably some advantages to being naked.‶  Tami, basking in the sun, said, ‶Too many to list.  Es gemutlich.‶  Which he then explained, trying to translate as Tami looked on in amusement, meant ‶Naked is warm and fuzzy.‶  They laughed at that.  Another awkward Congi comment that they performed a judo move on to make it turn out well.<br><br>Tonight Rod's mind had been filled with these thoughts as he watched Tami zip through her assignment.  There was nobody faster on a computer; her high school had been little more than a vo-tech school, with everyone taking typing and data entry.  As with any fast typist, using a mouse slowed her down, but she inventively solved that problem by placing the mouse on the floor.  Blazing away at the keyboard while working the click buttons with her toes, she flew through anything she was doing.<br><br>By and by Rod had gotten tired with his work and at a certain point he had lain back in his pajamas and closed his eyes, the blueprint falling to the floor.  A few minutes later he felt gentle hands pulling down his bottoms, the warm engulfing mouth, and he smiled...<br><br>Now, with Tami on top of him, he watched as she crested and jerked through a series of spasms. What's that now -- number ten?  Rod chided himself.  Tami hated being kept score of.  She came down slightly from the last orgasm, but only slightly.  He knew what she wanted to feel and kept his hips thrust up.  He held her hands down on the bed.  In this way she could rub her clit against his pubic bone and stay on the brink.  She liked doing this usually around the middle of their lovemaking.  Eyes half-closed, breathing in short gasps, he could swear he felt her heartbeat on his dick as she lay suspended on the brink of orgasm, now and then giving into it, then coming down a bit, only to go up again when she chose.  All during which he felt the end of his dick flicking back and forth against her cervix.<br><br>She could stay suspended like this for half an hour or more.  It was difficult sometimes for him to hold his ejaculation, the pulsing of her inner muscles felt so good massaging his dick, the cervix relentlessly flicking his sensitive penis head, but being so tired tonight, he did not feel himself approaching the danger zone.  Not that it was always ‶danger‶ -- ‶Rod, you can go again!‶ Tami often said after he came, milking his softening dick with the supple internal muscles of her pussy, or her mouth, until he had another erection.  Tonight, though, he felt like after one load he would be soon fast asleep.<br><br>His mind wandered to his work difficulties as he looked up at her surfing along the edge from crest to crest.  He liked working with building materials but as a newly minted engineer he was learning that dealing with people was just as important...<br><br>She knew his mind was elsewhere.  She gave a little glance down and said, ‶it's -- uhh -- going to be all right -- lover -- ohhh... Fill me up, Baby.‶<br><br>She shifted her feet and pivoted on his dick so that she was facing away from him.  He moved up and started on her doggy style.  He could penetrate very deeply in this position, and had to be careful not to go sideways and poke an ovary, something which he'd heard was as painful as getting a poke in the balls.  Now he began to get a rhythm and emit the low groans that always turned her on.  With a short, sharp breath, she launched into what she often saved as her last orgasm, the longest and most powerful one.  ‶Ohh!  Ohh!  Ohh!‶  He counted six spasms and then he let himself go, filling her up with his semen that seemed like the last of his energy and power draining from him, leaving him spent.<br><br>They lay there, waiting for sleep.  As always she lay on top of the covers while he went underneath.  For a long time now, being under a blanket had been too suffocating for her.<br><br>But he was actually too tired to get to sleep.  Wordlessly they both got up, he getting into his pajamas again, and padded to the kitchen for some decaf tea.<br><br>As she often did, she sat cross-legged on top of the kitchen table.  She had become quite the table sitter over the past couple of years.  He sipped, and played idly with the pubic hair in front of him.  Finally she spoke.<br><br>‶You're worried about work, aren't you?  What's going on, Baby?‶  She stroked his smooth shaved scalp.<br><br>He looked up and put it the best way he could manage.  ‶My boss is hard to get along with.  Very, well, bossy.‶<br><br>‶Why is he like that?‶<br><br>‶Well Babe, he's what you might call an 'alpha male'.  Head of the herd.‶<br><br>‶Alpha male?‶<br><br>‶Right.‶<br><br>She sipped.  ‶Or as we women call it, an insecure jerk.‶<br><br>Rod laughed and kept laughing.  He had never heard that female viewpoint and it was refreshing and liberating.  ‶Yes.  That's exactly what he must be.‶<br><br>‶Rough to deal with that kind of person, I bet.‶<br><br>Rod recognized this as a counseling move Tami probably picked up from Marisol, who had been with the campus crisis intervention service.  Still, it was effective in getting him to open up.  ‶Yes.  Sometimes I think he already knows he will answer 'no' before I even talk to him.‶<br><br>‶Is he like this with everyone?‶<br><br>‶In a way.  But with me, the impression I get is, he thinks I'm unqualified.‶<br><br>‶How can that be?  You have a degree and one year of Corps of Engineers service.‶<br><br>Rod exhaled.  ‶He thinks I got the job just because I'm African-American.  I just know it.‶<br><br>‶Did you?‶<br><br>‶Did I what?‶<br><br>‶Did you get the job because you're black?‶<br><br>One could never lie to Tami.  Rod searched his mind.<br><br>‶Yes, I think I did,‶ he said finally.  ‶They have an affirmative action obligation, and the other guys who applied, I saw them during the interviews, they seemed older and more experienced.  And white.  And they hire me, a black kid almost right out of school.‶<br><br>Tami scratched a nipple and stirred her tea.<br><br>‶So what do I do now?‶ Rod said, looking up at her.  Then he looked a little lower and couldn't help himself.  He stetched up and kissed one sun-darkened nipple and then the other.<br><br>She cleared her throat and said, ‶What you do is be the best damn engineer that insecure alpha jerk ever had.‶<br><br>Rod nodded to himself.  ‶Yes.‶<br><br>‶It's a gift that history has given you.  Think of your ancestors.  'I am the dream of the slave'...‶<br><br>Rod smiled to this reference to the famous Maya Angelou poem.  ‶Indeed.‶<br><br>Continuing the quotation, Tami said, ‶'I rise; I rise!'‶<br><br>The smile on him was now ear-to-ear and he was almost in tears.  ‶I rise!‶<br><br>They looked at each other and sipped one last sip.  A moment passed.<br><br>‶Speaking of which,‶ she said, lying back and wrapping her nimble feet behind his ears, ‶can you take me up again Baby?‶<br><br>‶Of course, Babe,‶ he said, putting his tea down and gently moving in with his tongue..." },
      { title: "Chapter 8", content: "Up on the fourth, top floor of Thayer Hall, in the office of Department of Fashion Technology Chair Albert Girardo, that person sat with Professor Shel Wanamaker as they absently gazed out the big bay window that overlooked the bright snow-covered campus.<br><br>Then Girardo, an old guy in a turtleneck sweater, black pants and moccasins, looked down again to leaf through the portfolio, as if he were looking at photos of persons with two heads.  ‶There's only one word for these: weird.‶<br><br>‶Also inventive, ingenious, possibly groundbreaking if you ask me,‶ Wanamaker said.  ‶Come on, admit it.  If you didn't know it was Tami Smithers --‶<br><br>‶I just can't get my mind past it.  Clothes designed by someone who can never wear any.  There's no denying there's some kind of genius here, but it's a genius from another dimension.  How long has she been 'au natural'?‶<br><br>‶Three and a half years.  Not one stitch, not so much as a pair of flip-flops on her feet either.‶<br><br>‶Is this a pant or a very long boot?‶ Girardo said, turning the portfolio sideways and then upside down.  ‶I hate to say it, but she's probably forgotten what clothes feel like.  Maybe she doesn't really know what she's doing any more.‶<br><br>A moment went by.  ‶We've got to send someone to the International.  We haven't sent anyone in five years.‶<br><br>‶That's because we haven't had anyone good enough in five years,‶ Girardo countered.  ‶And even that last time, it was a close call.‶<br><br>‶You know the problem as well as I do.  If we keep on not sending anyone, they'll drop us from their panel.‶<br><br>‶Where is it this year?‶<br><br>‶Montreal.‶<br><br>‶Oh Christ!  I forgot.  Right in our goddamn back yard.‶<br><br>‶So this is something we might have to do.‶<br><br>‶She's not a major,‶ Girardo said lamely.<br><br>‶And...  We've sent submissions from students minoring in fashion before.‶<br><br>Girardo put the portfolio down.  ‶What if she makes the cut?  We can't send a goddamn naked girl to a goddamn fashion award show.  And what if she wins!!  What if she wins!!  The most prestigious fashion industry fellowship in North America, and it goes to a naked woman!  They'll get publicity like never before, but not the kind they want -- a naked woman who will be bopping around the campus of --‶<br><br>‶They would never give the fellowship to a naked woman.‶<br><br>‶Then aren't we setting her up to fail?  And besides, there's no way she's going to win.  Even if she was clothed.  They'll give it to one of those inbred French kids like they always do.  The odds are a thousand to one.‶<br><br>‶We could make that clear to her when we tell her.  She could handle that.  Fashion isn't the center of her life.  Her being a minor is actually an advantage as to that.‶  Wanamaker continued, ‶Time is short.  You know how I feel.  We should tell her we want to submit her as our candidate.  The deadline is in three weeks, and we have to give her a chance to put together her submission portfolio before that.  She won't win, but at least we'll stay on their panel.‶<br><br>‶Here she comes,‶ Girardo said, looking out the bay window.<br><br>‶Where?  Oh.‶  On the main concourse, in the middle of dozens of students going here and there for the next class, the naked girl, easy to pick out of course, was happily chatting on her cell phone, bookbag flung over one shoulder, hanging down to where it bounced against her bare buns as she walked with the swiftness of someone who was used to a tight schedule.<br><br>‶Seems like she's in a good mood,‶ Girardo said.<br><br>‶She usually is.  Everyone loves her too.  And she's got a statue named after her.‶<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶Ever see that girl sticking her arms out like she's about to fly?  Near the Union?‶<br><br>‶I hardly ever go there.‶<br><br>‶It's called 'Tami Takes Flight'.  Latimer did it.‶<br><br>‶When was that?‶<br><br>‶The year you were on sabbatical.‶<br><br>‶Oh... Well that's certainly interesting, though not relevant... Look at her,‶ Girardo said as Tami broke into a little skip, going off the path to take a short cut toward them, kicking up snow with her toes.  ‶She's traipsing through that snow like it's summer and it's sand on a beach.‶<br><br>‶A nude beach, it would have to be.‶<br><br>‶Right.  My point is, how is a person like that supposed to know what anyone wants as far as clothes go?  The International is not a bunch of dilettantes who design monstrosities for the Oscars red carpet.  They affect real mass-production decisions, like what the chain stores will carry.  The first thing a person wants clothes for is warmth.  And there she is,‶ he said, motioning toward the approaching Tami, ‶skipping barefoot and naked through the snow... What's her needs status?  They take that into account these days, or least they're supposed to.‶<br><br>‶She's married, to a recent engineering graduate, who's working for base pay on his first real job.  She's from Providence -- that's another thing in her favor.  Her family is working class, she has a younger brother in Iraq, no other source of income aside from her father's Navy pension and his hardware store, which according to our search is not doing too well.‶<br><br>‶Think she knows that?‶<br><br>‶Probably not.  I hear the father is proud of her but is a real stubborn, Irish beer drinking kind of guy.‶<br><br>‶Not your typical designer background.‶<br><br>‶I'll say.  She also had a couple of close friends who died in 9/11.‶<br><br>‶What, that plaque in the admin building?  What's their names again --?‶<br><br>‶Mandy Rabinowitz and Jeffrey Dillon.‶<br><br>‶Oh right.  The kid who had the show on the 68th floor.  Man.  What a horrible loss.‶<br><br>They both sat in silence.  Before they were ready for it, they heard the door to the stairwell close shut and the approaching slap of bare feet.<br><br>Though their door was open, they saw a bare arm reach around and knock.  ‶Come on in, Tami,‶ Wanamaker said.<br><br>She moved into the doorway slowly and politely.  ‶Hi Professor, hi Mr. Girardo,‶ she said with a little nod.  ‶How did you know it was me?‶<br><br>Wanamaker said with a smile, ‶We heard the stairwell door close.  Everyone else takes the elevator... I told Mr. Girardo about your presentation on bra measurement.  It was excellent as always.‶<br><br>A blushing ‶Thanks.‶<br><br>Putting on sociability, Girardo looked up and said, ‶That's a wonderful new hair color you've selected, Ms. Smithers.‶<br><br>To his surprise Tami looked down at her crotch and opened her legs slightly.  ‶Thanks.  It's called 'plum'.‶<br><br>Girardo gave a quick and pointed look to his colleague.<br><br>Sitting right next to where Tami was standing, Wanamaker tried very hard not to notice the dark red curls right near his face.  Or the interesting fact that her pubic lips, jutting out slightly, were the same color as the surrounding curls.  He cleared his throat, looked up at her face, and said, ‶We've been enjoying your... portfolio.‶<br><br>‶Oh that,‶ Tami said.  Then perhaps thinking she shouldn't have been so dismissive, she said, ‶I hope it's O.K.‶<br><br>‶It's more than O.K, Tami, it's very... inventive,‶ Girardo said, paging through the computer graphics and freehand drawings, accompanied by more explanatory text than usual and, very unusual indeed, mathematical equations of some sort.<br><br>‶Thanks.‶<br><br>‶This uh, tank top or whatever it is,‶ Girardo said, resisting the urge to turn the damn album upside down, ‶design 17A.  How did you get the neckline so high with so little material?‶<br><br>‶Well it's in the equations there,‶ Tami said.  She dropped her backpack and turned toward it, apparently not aware that her butt was sticking in their direction.  She fished a kind of ruler out.  ‶Let me show you.‶<br><br>Girardo had some kind of vague memory from his 1950's high school days of this sticklike thing Tami now waved in front of him.  ‶The neckline is a catenary, which you get by calculating the hyperbolic sine -- ‶<br><br>‶The hyperbolic -- what?  What is this thing?‶<br><br>‶It's a slide rule.  I got it off the internet.  These are really great, in fact they're beautiful.  This one's a Hemmi.  You see the SH scale here, you read it along with the C scale for radians -- ‶<br><br>As Tami went on and on in what seemed to Girardo like a foreign language, his mouth slowly opened in utter incomprehension.  Halfway through he realized Tami's left breast was almost slapping him on the side of the face as she leaned alongside him so they could both see these sticks she was sliding back and forth.  Wanamaker looked on in amusement.<br><br>When she was done, Girardo said, ‶I'm afraid it's been a while since --‶  Actually, he had never, ever been able to --<br><br>Tami stood up and started over.  ‶The slide rule is based on logarithms rather than linear relations.‶  Her fingers danced along the scales as she explained.  ‶See how the distance from 1 to 2 is the same as from 2 to 4?  It's because that distance is a factor of 2.  From 4 to 8 is also the same.  Now let me set it to  show 6 divided by 3 is 2.  See?  Without moving the scales you see at the same time that 12 divided by 3 is 4, 38.4 divided by 3 is, 12.8, and so on.  The whole operation of division unfolds before you in one panoramic sweep!‶<br><br>Tami was trying to light a bulb over Girardo's head with this picturesque phrase but there wasn't even a bulb there to turn on.  ‶Oh,‶ he said weakly.<br><br>By way of nudging Girardo in the right direction, Wanamaker said, ‶Tami, I wonder if you have any ambitions for your designing talent.‶<br><br>Tami thought for a second, then said, ‶I've designed dresses and clothes for my friends.  It seems whenever there's a wedding or a formal dance I get called.  It's just my minor, though.  My major is math, and my project is math with biochemistry.  My friend Gretchen and I are working on a biodegradable, toxin-proof fabric that holds heat in the cold and breathes in the heat.‶<br><br>‶That would be quite an accomplishment.‶<br><br>‶I heard about that project from Professor Ling,‶ Wanamaker said.  ‶That's Gretchen Spaulding, right?‶<br><br>‶Yes, Gretchen and me.  What we want is to develop something that can be used by our troops in Iraq.  My brother tells me it gets both very hot and very cold there, at least where he is.  Gretchen's fiance is there too.‶<br><br>‶I hear they need equipment there,‶ Wanamaker said.  Then, perhaps tactlessly, ‶I hope they're safe.‶<br><br>‶Joe is in a part of the country where not much happens, and Roger, that's Gretchen's fiance, he's training helicopter pilots.‶<br><br>‶I see,‶ Girardo said.  ‶Well, good for you.  And good for Gretchen too.‶<br><br>‶Thanks.‶<br><br>There was an uneasy silence, at least uneasy for the two professors.<br><br>‶Well, Ms. Smithers,‶ Girardo said, ‶we just wanted to say that we're very impressed with your work, not only on your biochem project, but also in our classes.  I hope you stay interested in this field of endeavor.  See you around.‶<br><br>‶Thanks again.‶  She picked up her backpack and started to leave.  From out in the hall she said, ‶What happened to that cartoon thing?‶<br><br>‶The what?‶<br><br>‶You know, that old magazine thing?‶<br><br>She was referring to an old National Lampoon item entitled, ‶What high fashion would look like if designers were heterosexual.‶  It had a picture of a so-called designer in a sweatshirt and jeans, pointing to his new ‶design‶, an invisible dress on a naked woman.  ‶And if she gets cold, she can always wear a car,‶ he was saying.  Girardo, who was gay, had put the item up some years ago as a joke on himself.  But he took it down recently out of sensitivity to Tami's plight.<br><br>‶Um, it was time to change the board a bit,‶ Girardo said.<br><br>‶Oh.  Too bad, it was pretty funny.  Well, bye.‶<br><br>They heard the bare footsteps receding and then the stairwell door close.  Soft descending footfalls faded into silence.<br><br>Wanamaker said, ‶I knew you'd chicken out.  You won't get many more chances.‶<br><br>Girardo sighed and said, ‶Shel, you know I'm always swayed by you.  I have to admit, strange as it is, this girl's work is exceptional.  She probably really does deserve to be our candidate.  But a naked fashion designer... This is the weirdest situation I've ever been in.‶<br><br>‶I think you're being hyperbolic.‶<br><br>‶Oh shut up.‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 9", content: "The second, mezzanine level of the college library was quiet on this dark afternoon. The sound of the heavy rain outside was all that could be heard, a rain that was quickly turning the snow into slush. A slush that this time, according to the forecast, would not freeze overnight. It was taking a while, but the deep freeze this north country was famous for had broken and it was warming up, if ever so slowly.<br><br>Tami Smithers was parked at her usual table in her usual position. One leg curled up, the other heel up on the table, her foot facing in, markers of various colors slotted between her toes. With her left hand she was grading papers from the remedial math class she tutored, selecting the appropriate marker according to her own system. Red = incorrect, Black = correct but incomplete work, Blue = correct, Green = helpful comments.<br><br>Next to these papers were a couple of textbooks. Her backpack was on the chair next to her. She worked quietly in the quiet library.<br><br>Another creature lurked nearby.<br><br>At first it was just a shadow in the stacks behind her. Watching, waiting...<br><br>It was Rosaria, tall and athletic with cropped hair, travel pouch around her waist. In wool jacket, leotard top, tights and long wool socks over her duck boots, looking like the Latina lesbian she was. She silently circled in front of the table and, when Tami looked up, she leaned across the table and kissed the big toe.<br><br>Standing back at attention she whispered, ‶My Queen.‶<br><br>Tami smiled and whispered, ‶In a minute.‶<br><br>A quick glance down told Rosaria the reason. Tami wanted to give her students' work her undivided attention. Rosaria sat down at the next table and pretended to text message on her cell phone.<br><br>A moment later Tami put the papers away, took the markers from her toes, stretched her arms back, her breasts riding high on her chest, and sighed. Rosaria's mouth almost watered at the slight scent that issued. No doubt it had been several hours since the Queen's last release.<br><br>Gracefully she removed the chair next to Tami, bent under the table, and sat cross-legged in front of her altar. It was then that Tami emitted a quick, sharp gasp. As Tami read her text with quivering hands Rosaria did what she had learned so well to do. A moment later the sudden long breaths, then the jolting hips, told her she was successful. Tami turned the page as Rosaria laved the engorged lips for a few seconds with the Queen's nectar and then gently rolled them back into her mouth. In less than a minute Tami went up again. The edge having been taken off, this one was longer, more peaceful.<br><br>Rosaria kissed the palace entrance gently, then scooted around behind to plant a kiss on the naked girl's butt. In response Tami got up on her knees, transferred one knee to the next chair and bent forward, her head over the edge of the table as she kept reading. Rosaria separated the chairs and, tall girl that she was, could sit cross-legged while reaching up to insert her tongue in a different place. Queen Tami was very considerate of her subjects and kept herself clean and well-irrigated for the benefit of those who wished to enter her palace from the rear. Now she bestowed on Rosaria yet another reward, the sound of her Queen's pleasure. ‶Mmmmmm...‶<br><br>All the while Tami kept reading, now and then emitting an ‶ohh. . .‶ or a little gasp. Now her subject inserted fingers into her pussy so that the tongue could play off against them. And, of course, the G spot, playing off the fingers of the other hand pressing rearward against the clit. Soon Tami was shaking violently and, another gift, Rosaria sensed her laying her forehead down on the text until the spasms were over. Then with a deep breath and a slight smell of sweat, Tami, future valedictorian that she was, went back to her assigned reading for her English Literature class. That she could concentrate on it and be able to retain it afterwards was in no way taken as a sign of disinterest. It was just part of her mystique.<br><br>It was some five minutes later, when Rosaria, exploring the delights of Tami's rectum, was in the middle of enjoying Tami's fifth orgasm of the session, that Ms. Tami Smithers was approached by Sarah Wickland.<br><br>Sarah Wickland, in-law of Henry Ross, the evil college lawyer, author of Tami's freshman year torments, who had escaped outside of her reach as well as of everyone else's. Sarah Wickland, law partner of Brian Cook, whose ‶rent‶ at his Pacific coast estate had been to have all his female tenants stay naked, a sore trial for Nina West and company but just a part of everyday life for Tami. Sarah Wickland, whose clients tended to specialize in bondage and discipline, and included the Cronenberg School, and Taft McNamee and his trade in pony girls.<br><br>Yet for all the strange things she had seen in her business, Sarah was quite unprepared for what she now witnessed as she drew near. Glad to see Tami after a space of two years and, expecting that Tami, having finally trusted her, would be glad likewise, she stopped when she saw the look of orgasm on her face and, upon further viewing, the crossed legs visible behind her on the floor.<br><br>She stopped. Then she continued. She signaled behind her and another woman, a little older than Tami and strikingly beautiful, obediently emerged from the stairwell and followed her.<br><br>Not sure how she should handle this situation, Sarah smiled as she stood at the table. Tami smiled too, or tried to, while keeping her eyes determinedly open. In the clutches of orgasm the look in her eyes changed instantaneously. She was a surprised friend, a sleepy fawn, a scared child, a lost soul, a witness to a birth, the Creator of the Universe, an eager girl scout, a sprinter straining for the finish line, a proud countess, a gambler counting cards -- fear, love, death, life, redemption . . . every emotion except the one Sarah expected, shame.<br><br>‶H - hi Ms. Wick - ck -lannnd,‶ Tami said.<br><br>‶Hi Tami. You just won't call me Sarah, will you? They told me I could find you here. Is this a, uh, bad time to talk?‶<br><br>‶N - not at all -- ohhh!‶<br><br>Sarah pulled up the chair across from Tami and sat down. ‶I bring you greetings from Taft McNamee and his board of directors.‶ As she spoke the other woman, in a bulky black leather coat and spiky black boots, approached but stayed standing behind her. She wore a studded collar that nicely set off the gorgeous face.<br><br>Tami looked up and nodded to her with some effort.<br><br>‶This is Katie, one of the ponies from the farm. You might remember her. She was your stable mate for a short time.‶<br><br>Tami's head jerked a bit as she looked up again. There might have been a look of recognition but her kaleidoscope eyes made it hard to tell. ‶Hi.‶<br><br>Katie looked at Sarah, who said, ‶You may speak.‶<br><br>Katie said, ‶Tami, you were called 'Naked' when you were with us ponies. I have been elected to say on behalf of all of us, thanks to your bravery the lives of all ponies are greatly improved and we will always be grateful.‶<br><br>Had Rosaria been listening, she would have found this exchange quite arresting. But she was in another world. Tami experienced the noodlings of Rosaria's tongue in her rectum, and the fingers bringing her to another orgasm, as she continued to engage in conversation.<br><br>‶Th-thank you,‶ Queen Tami said from her throne. ‶H - how is M - Mr. Cook -- ohhh...‶<br><br>Sarah looked down. ‶I'm sorry to say that Brian passed away a few months ago. He never did recover from that stroke.‶<br><br>Tami's body quaked on the brink but she reached around and firmly placed her hand on Rosaria's head. Rosaria understood what that meant. She withdrew her tongue and hands, even though it meant leaving Tami quivering and unsatisfied, only a few licks from orgasm.<br><br>‶That m-makes me very sad,‶ Tami said, controlling her metabolism.<br><br>‶Yes,‶ Sarah Wickland said. ‶It seems like the creator of our entire universe passed away.‶" },

      { title: "Chapter 11", content: "Sarah and Tami looked at each other and then looked down as if in respectful silence. Then Tami looked up at Sarah and motioned behind her and Rosaria once again drew her fingers up front into her crotch. She inserted her tongue deep into Tami's rectum, making Tami flinch and gasp. Sarah, having watched Tami's all-fours orientation, already had figured out what Rosaria had been doing and knew that she was simply resuming her prior attentions. During this entire time Tami did not break eye contact with Sarah.<br><br>Sarah was about to instruct Katie to speak again when Tami launched into a climax, especially violent due to having been left near the peak. Tami seemed waiting for Sarah to say something but it was Sarah, ironically, who was too distracted to continue. The quaking naked student and the well-dressed lawyer looked at each other across as wide a gulf as two human beings can look. When Tami had come down again Katie spoke.<br><br>‶We bear a gift for you.‶ She looked to Sarah, who said, ‶Tami, your trials while you were trying to prove that you had been falsely corralled made a great impression on the farm and indeed on the entire pony girl culture. You were tested by Taft and his board and did not betray your parents even while the tail you were wearing was being made to press against your ovaries. Taft had told me that this was the maximum level of pain that any master was allowed to inflict in his or her pony, equivalent to a man being hit in the testicles. Further neurocerebral research shows that is incorrect. In fact, the pain you underwent is more equivalent to a man having his testicles placed in a vise and gradually tightened until they rupture.<br><br>‶This discovery, as well as your example, had quite an effect on the pony farm directors, particularly the men. It forced a change in the pony system. As you know, it is an entirely voluntary and humane enterprise. Key to this is the new model of tail. We would like you to have one.‶<br><br>Katie, drawing from a bag hitherto concealed within her coat, brought out a highly polished wooden shaft about a foot long with a beautiful, multi-colored tail of what looked like horsehair about twice the length of the shaft, and carefully draped it across the table.<br><br>‶UHH!!‶ It was Rosaria's strangled scream, issuing from behind Tami.<br><br>Tami, eyes wide open, moved forward a bit and Rosaria fell backward to the floor. The naked girl quickly leaped back and picked Rosaria up, without much effort hefting the tall young woman and sitting her on the table. Rosaria had her hand to her mouth and was in tears. Sarah and Katie looked upon all of this with puzzlement and alarm.<br><br>Rosaria put her head against Tami's breasts as Tami held her head close. ‶I'm sorry, Ro.‶ She looked up to Katie. ‶It's not your fault, Katie… Let me see.‶ Rosaria tentatively stuck out her bruised tongue. ‶Looks O.K. Don't worry.‶ Again, Tami held Rosaria against her breasts. Then looked up. ‶Sorry for the interruption. Seeing this… thing… well it was, like, a shock. My anus contracted.‶<br><br>‶I should have asked her to take her tongue out first,‶ Sarah said. ‶I'll never forget what Figvee said to me. 'Her rectal tone is amazing'.‶<br><br>Tami smiled as if she should feel she was being complimented. Meanwhile Rosaria disengaged from Tami's embrace and said, ‶I think… bleahhh… I think I'll be all right. Her thphincter is tho thexy.‶<br><br>She giggled which gave everyone else permission to laugh, including Katie.<br><br>Tami took the tail into both hands. ‶This was the most humungo thing that was ever in my butt,‶ she said objectively. And that was saying a lot. ‶I was so totally impaled, like a specimen of a butterfly.‶<br><br>Sarah brought forth a little remote and pushed a button. Amazingly, the wood was not wood, it was a convincing plastic imitation. In Tami's hands the tail began sinuously twisting, like a snake. The naked girl gasped and then, after a long moment, started to giggle. ‶This is so weird!‶<br><br>‶Tails used to be for pain,‶ Sarah said. Now they're for pleasure. The protrusion you see coming out now is designed to rub against the G spot and various other places in the vaginal wall through gentle pressure on the rectal wall. Now masters control their ponies not through punishment but by withholding the reward of orgasm.‶<br><br>‶Reinforcement, rather than punishment,‶ Tami said. ‶Or I think. I'm trying to remember back to that Intro Psych course I took.‶<br><br>‶Precisely. And reinforcement is a more powerful motivator. Our ponies have become orgasm addicts, and to get their reward they will do things for their masters that they didn't in the past. Everybody wins.‶<br><br>Tami looked at the tail in her hands again, apparently deep in thought.<br><br>‶It is yours, Naked,‶ Katie said, ‶whether you want to use it, or just keep it as a token of our affection and gratitude.‶<br><br>Tami smiled. ‶'Naked'?‶<br><br>‶That is how I remember you.‶<br><br>‶Your pony name was never officially changed, so that's how you still appear in the farm records,‶ Sarah said. ‶Of course, your status is listed as 'released from contract'.‶<br><br>Katie said, ‶I remember how you wrote that call for help on that post-it and reached around with your toes to put it on the stable door.‶<br><br>Tami said, ‶I thought you were sleeping.‶<br><br>Katie smiled. ‶We real ponies are more aware than you think.‶<br><br>Sarah said, ‶Katie is quite an intelligent woman. She and her master have become a professional writing team, writing in technical journals, in the field of heuristics, I think.‶<br><br>‶Ohmigod… Amazing!‶ Tami enthused. ‶I took a course that last year. Wow. I feel like I should get your autograph.‶<br><br>Katie said, ‶I even wrote a story about you. It's about how you got into clothes again.‶<br><br>Tami looked at her a long time. A thoughtful, faraway look.<br><br>Sensing the visit had run its course, Sarah said, ‶Tami, here's my card. I gave it to you on a previous occasion but, um, you didn't exactly have a place to put it. Don't be a stranger. And of course here's the remote.‶<br><br>And with that, Sarah and Katie said their goodbyes and left. Rosaria went back to Tami's embrace and they sat there for a long time, in the quiet library mezzanine with the wind and the slushy rain pounding away outside." },
      { title: "Chapter 12", content: "In the Student Union, along the wall farthest from the snack bar, at one of those tables that were usually empty, seven young women, of various styles of dress, their winter coats draped on their chairs, sat silently as papers were distributed.<br><br>Another meeting of the Tami Lickers.<br><br>They had tried other, more dignified names, such as The Priestesses of the Temple, or The Queen's Court, but none had stuck. As a kind of code they had shortened the painfully obvious name to ‶the TL's‶.<br><br>Georgene spoke. ‶This shows the full clitoris. As you can see, it's not just the 'man in the boat'.‶<br><br>‶Tami refers to it in the feminine,‶ Myra, a scholarly-looking black girl in glasses and a granny dress, said.<br><br>‶That's a good idea… But as you can see, it's actually a pretty big structure. The clit is like the tip of the iceberg. The bottom of it is the G spot. You can feel it yourself.‶<br><br>‶Actually I hate poking around in there, at least in my own,‶ Marianne said.<br><br>‶I know… But the important thing is, when you get into Tami's front chamber, try to feel the G spot — it's like bifurcated.‶<br><br>‶I've felt it, when I licked her on Tuesday,‶ Jeane said. ‶It's like two little grapes, almost, connected by a stem.‶<br><br>Georgene said, ‶The important thing is, don't be too poky. Tami responds well to stroking that's gentle. As she gets excited you will feel the two 'grapes', like, get a little firmer and more prominent. Tongue the clit at the same time. I haven't experimented a great deal, and actually I haven't licked her all week.‶<br><br>‶Poor baby,‶ said Marianne in a pitying voice.<br><br>‶Yeah I know, I've just been so damn busy. I only see her when she's outside walking to classes.‶<br><br>‶Then just do her there!‶ said Spica, a freshman in a punk hairdo and outfit.<br><br>‶You KNOW she won't let you do that,‶ Marianne said.<br><br>Barbara, a grad student who was about 30, spoke to Spica in her usual slow and thoughtful manner. ‶The administration tolerates what we do, because they know Tami needs it. But Tami doesn't want to cause them embarrassment and all kinds of other problems by the sight of her being licked in public. That's why we have to find her in semi-private spots like her library table.‶<br><br>‶I think Rosaria's finding her there now,‶ Marianne said. ‶At least that's what she told me she was going to do.‶<br><br>‶Jen McIntyre was in town, I hear,‶ Spica said.<br><br>‶Really? Man I've been out of touch,‶ Georgene said. Jen, foremother of the TL's and a bottomless spring of useful information, was quite a celebrity to this bunch.<br><br>‶She had to leave though,‶ Spica said.<br><br>‶Damn, we'd like to talk to her about some pointers,‶ Marianne said.<br><br>‶Next time I see Tami I'll try to get Jen's cell phone… Well, getting back to the G-spot, has anyone found whether alternate clit and G-spot strokes work better?‶<br><br>Spica said, ‶I did simultaneous licks and strokes yesterday and she came and came and came.‶<br><br>‶That's what Tami does,‶ Marianne said.<br><br>‶I counted 17 times,‶ Spica added.<br><br>This met with calls of ‶Brag! Brag! Brag!‶<br><br>‶Just don't tell her. Tami really hates it when people count,‶ Jeane said.<br><br>‶Why is that?‶ Marianne looked at Barbara.<br><br>Barbara thought for a second and said, ‶I don't know.‶<br><br>‶When you really get into it, you lose count yourself,‶ Teresa said. ‶You're in such another world, just you and her.‶<br><br>There was a general murmur of agreement. Except for Melissa, a blonde girl who looked like a model and was new to the club. She sat silently on the side and was taking this all in. She looked at the handout and studied it intently.<br><br>She spoke up. ‶I wonder how that feels like,‶ she said, ‶to come so many times, like that?‶<br><br>Marianne said, ‶I actually asked her that once. She said it was like being lifted up into the sky, and looking down on all of life from above.‶<br><br>‶Strange,‶ Jeane said.<br><br>‶I kind of feel like I'm up there with her at times,‶ Georgene said.<br><br>‶It's what it's all about,‶ Marianne said.<br><br>Spica said, ‶That's not how my own orgasm feels.‶<br><br>‶Well of course it would be different,‶ Barbara said. ‶If you have thirty or more orgasms a day, you develop a different perspective.‶<br><br>‶Oh gosh — you think she has that many?‶ Spica said.<br><br>Barbara shrugged. ‶Just an estimate, between us and what she does at home.‶<br><br>‶I'm surprised Rod isn't dead by now,‶ Jeane laughed.<br><br>‶What about her nipples?‶ Melissa asked.<br><br>‶Gentle rubbing between the fingers, after you start the buildup,‶ Georgene said.<br><br>‶Can I suck them?‶<br><br>‶Of course, she responds well to that, even a little mild biting. But watch where you are. It can't be too public. That's why it's best to work from below.‶<br><br>‶What if somebody comes by? What if they want to talk to her?‶<br><br>‶Just continue. She can converse through an orgasm. She doesn't want you to stop. It's hard to explain, but she kind of feels that asking us to stop would be impolite to us.‶<br><br>‶She's very considerate. I would hate to have my Tami licking interrupted.‶<br><br>‶A very good, kind Queen,‶ said Marianne, with equal parts of whimsy and seriousness.<br><br>After a brief lull, Georgene brought out a little plastic box. ‶O.K., let's get the beat.‶<br><br>Spica started snapping her fingers in rhythm. Others followed, some trying to push the beat faster, others trying to slow it down, but all snapping more or less together. Far across the room, some guys at a table looked over momentarily.<br><br>‶O.K., stop.‶ Then Georgene pushed a button on the box. It was a metronome. Tick – tick – tick – tick –<br><br>‶Shoot. Too fast again,‶ Jeane said.<br><br>This was part of the training they gave themselves. The metronome was set to tick every 0.8 seconds — the length between orgasmic contractions, according to what they'd read. They knew that, by licking just ahead of the beat, they could extend Tami's orgasms by a few spasms. So predicting the next spasm was key.<br><br>After the business of the meeting was over they got back to regular small talk.<br><br>‶I got a dress code letter yesterday,‶ Jeane said.<br><br>‶Oh God. The crackdown continues,‶ Barbara said. ‶What did you do? Show a bit of ankle?‶<br><br>‶I had on a pink tee and they must have seen my navel poking out,‶ Jeane said. ‶All this, under my coat that was probably open for a few seconds. That was the part they underlined, anyway.‶<br><br>She was referring to the campus dress code, which this year was starting to be actually enforced. It was an old dreary document prohibiting bare midriffs, backless or strapless tops, torn jeans, very short shorts, and the like. Any student seen violating it would get an intracampus note with the relevant provision underlined.<br><br>‶Last week I took off my shoes in the library and they dinged me. I couldn't believe it,‶ Spica said.<br><br>‶Were you wearing socks?‶<br><br>‶No.‶<br><br>‶Well there you have it. Is that a big deal to wear socks?‶ Marianne said.<br><br>‶Claudia got dinged for wearing a tube top — under a shirt!‶<br><br>‶Was the shirt open?‶<br><br>‶Well yes.‶<br><br>‶All she has to do is keep it closed. Her own fault.‶<br><br>‶Remember back in October on that nice day when they dinged Roger because he was playing frisbee in bare feet on the grass?‶<br><br>‶That was ridiculous.‶<br><br>‶If they enforce the no flip-flops part when the weather gets warm, there will be a massive revolt.‶<br><br>‶I don't think they'd be that stupid.‶<br><br>‶Well what did you expect? This is still basically a conservative Baptist college. Us, and Congi, we're practically the only exceptions.‶<br><br>The conversation was halted by the approaching sound of bare soles on the cold tile, and the clip-clop of boots. It was Tami and Gretchen with sodas, Tami also with a hero sandwich. Gretchen was toting an umbrella and her overcoat and boots were wet. Tami's hair was disheveled and wet but her skin was already almost dry, just a few drops on the small of her back.<br><br>‶Guten tag,‶ Tami said, placing her soda and hero down. As she stood there she stretched and sighed, apparently unconscious of the near-swoon that the TL's underwent upon seeing her tan, concave tummy and navel.<br><br>The TL's worshipped Tami's body, had made drawings of it, taken pictures of various parts of it (with Tami's permission), knew every naked inch in detail, inside and out. Jeane, whose proclivities were in that direction, even had pet names for each of Tami's toes. Other common nicknames for her various body parts were ‶nubs‶ (nipples), ‶forest‶ (pubic hair), ‶winkie‶ (anus), ‶slopes‶ (the bottom curves of her breasts), ‶knob‶ (cervix), and ‶vault‶ (rectum). Tami's body was not only their place of worship but also their playground. As Spica once inartfully but enthusiastically put it, her pussy was their soccer field, her cervix was their monkey bars, her anus the slide into the play shed, her rectum the shed itself, her pussy lips the ropes. Her clit and G-spot together were the see-saw. The TL's celebrated Tami and in so doing celebrated themselves, the beauty and strength and capacities of the human female.<br><br>After Tami stretched, Myra said, ‶Your forest is beautiful. I like that color.‶<br><br>Tami looked down and slightly parted her legs. ‶Thanks. It's called 'plum', according to the box.‶<br><br>‶Wow, did you get every single hair? Even the ones near your winkie?‶ Spica asked.<br><br>‶I sure did,‶ Tami said with pride. She turned around and bent over, spreading her butt cheeks, cheerfully displaying the last hairs on her perineum. They were plum color, every single one. Further down, a space of clear, tanned skin, then the darker brown skin around her much-photographed anus.<br><br>‶Beautiful job.‶<br><br>‶Thanks, it took a long time,‶ Tami said as she turned back around, again not seeming to notice the near-swoon of her audience. Or perhaps having gotten used to it.<br><br>Tami and Gretchen pulled up chairs. Tami got right to work pigging out. As she did, a couple of the TL's leaned over and kissed her on the forehead as she smiled through munches.<br><br>Sessu, an architecture major from Japan, walked by. He waved to the TL's and bent down to kiss Tami's knee. ‶My Queen,‶ he said, smiling good-naturedly, then walked on. No male had tried to become a TL, it being unspokenly clear that Tami, faithful to her husband, would never accept it. It was a standing joke that the Queen's male subjects were restricted to kissing her on the knees, though in fact friendly hugs and kisses on her cheeks (the cheeks of her face, that is) were permitted as with anyone.<br><br>Tami practically inhaled the sandwich. As she was finishing she said, ‶Sorry Gretchen, about that class report.‶<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶That joke about the guns. I was trying to put you at ease but it was stupid.‶<br><br>‶Oh… Well that's O.K.‶ Gretchen was glad she hadn't had to bring it up herself. She had been really quite embarrassed by the presentation, more than she expected, and Tami's little joke hadn't helped. She decided to add, ‶Apology accepted.‶<br><br>‶What's this about?‶ Marianne said.<br><br>‶Nothing,‶ Gretchen said.<br><br>Some more small talk. Seeing a book half-out of Spica's bookbag, Jeane said, ‶What is that?‶<br><br>‶The Kama Sutra,‶ Spica said. ‶It's an Indian book of sex positions.‶<br><br>Gretchen looked at Tami and rolled her eyes.<br><br>Looking at the pretzeled couple on the cover, Barbara said, ‶How could you possibly do that without throwing your back out?‶<br><br>‶Well you old folks have to worry about that,‶ Spica teased.<br><br>‶It looks painful to me,‶ Jeane said. ‶Tom and I tried something like that once and I almost broke his dick off.‶<br><br>Talking about sex again. What girls do when they're together, at least some girls. Gretchen politely excused herself.<br><br>‶I'll catch up with you,‶ Tami said.<br><br>After Gretchen left, Marianne said, ‶It's more like an athletic event than making love,‶ looking at the cover.<br><br>Barbara said, ‶Call me old-fashioned, but there's no getting around the fact that missionary is the most intimate position.‶<br><br>‶I think it's when we go down on each other,‶ Jeane said. ‶He looks up at me, and I look up at him.‶<br><br>Some thoughful silence. Then Barbara said, ‶What do you think, Tami? What's the most intimate position?‶<br><br>Tami thought, leaned back on her chair sipping her soda, then swung her foot up onto the table, wiggling her toes slowly in thought. Playing with the straw, she said, ‶Anal sex.‶<br><br>‶Akkk,‶ Myra said. ‶That's painful.‶<br><br>‶It takes some practice,‶ Tami said.<br><br>‶How can you say that's the most intimate?‶ Myra said.<br><br>‶Because you're opening yourself up to him totally, surrendering your body to him, above and beyond what nature intended, a place not designed to accept a penis.‶<br><br>That thought stilled the conversation for a bit. Then Tami said, ‶I have to go. Auf wiedersehen.‶<br><br>‶Bye, Queen,‶ Marianne said.<br><br>Tami smiled and stood up. After tossing her empty soda into the waste can with a breast-jiggling jump shot, she gave them a royal bow, then grabbed her bookbag and walked out with a relaxed, upright pace that was decidedly queen-like and regal." },
      { title: "Chapter 13", content: "The wind and icy rain continued to pelt the quad.<br><br>One might think that, of all people, changes in weather would affect Tami, whose naked body had no protection from the elements, the most. In fact it seemed to affect her the least. Summer or winter, hot sun or cold rain, gentle breeze or gale-force wind, Tami walked across the quad with pretty much the same pace, on this occasion her feet splashing casually through the melting slush, her upright frame accepting the cold shower from above, her hair unconcernedly plastered to her shoulders as it got wetter and wetter, rivulets of water ski-jumping unnoticed off her stiff nipples, her tan skin sleek and wet.<br><br>Everyone else trudged slowly, shielding their faces from the rain, struggling with balky umbrellas, lurching ponderously in ponchos and raincoats, heavy steps in heavy boots. Tami passed through them easily, having learned the truth: that short term exposure to these conditions, once gotten used to, is not harmful.<br><br>True, it was only in warm weather that Tami exhibited what Jeane's boyfriend Tom called her ‶earth mother‶ walk — slow, languid, shoulders thrown back, breasts arched out as if in offering to feed the whole world, soles broadly pressing against the earth as if joining it, arms swinging gently at her sides.<br><br>But most times her walk was that of the high achiever she was — a bit quick, purposeful, sure of where she was going and intending to get there on time.<br><br>On this afternoon Tami glided effortlessly through the rain and into Rockley Hall, where in the basement lab she found Gretchen leaning over a table. Gretchen turned around upon hearing Tami dropping her backpack. Gretchen's smile was so broad that it made her goggles slide up.<br><br>Tami knew what that meant. Watching where she stepped, she made her way over to the lab table where Gretchen proudly showed her an entire tub filled with golden brown thread.<br><br>‶Woo hoo!!‶ Tami yelled, and she picked up the surprised Gretchen, who outweighed her by some 40 pounds, and twirled her around and around in a tight hug. ‶Come on, let's go!‶ She tried to pull her by the hand.<br><br>Gretchen made her wait while she cleaned up. Then she covered the tub and started for her coat and umbrella. ‶I'll go,‶ Tami said breathlessly, ‶take your time.‶<br><br>A minute later a naked girl could be seen running across the freezing puddles of the main concourse, holding a closed tub above her head, breasts wobbling wildly from side to side in rhythm with her strides, a big smile on her face. Even those well used to seeing Tami in all her moods wondered what was up and looked back at her after she passed. Others moved out of the way so as not to get hit by the wide-angle splashes from her tough bare feet.<br><br>As to Gretchen, she did take her time, deciding to record the day's work, though with a hand shaking with excitement. She battled the elements and finally made it to the dress lab in Thayer Hall. There she found Tami, as expected, seated at a sewing machine. Nearby was the high-speed automatic loom, where almost all the fabric had already been woven.<br><br>Tami was using the sewing machine she preferred, the real old style one she had found in a closet and reconditioned last year, the one operated by a see-saw pedal on the floor. She had one eye on a printout of one of her computer generated boot designs. As she worked the see-saw pedal with one foot, her other foot was up on the table where the thread was guided into the machine between her second and third toes, which grasped tightly and then let slack as required.<br><br>Tami finished with what looked like a sock. She stuffed it into an unlined rubber boot she had been keeping under the machine.<br><br>‶OK. You know what to do,‶ she said.<br><br>Gretchen bent down and slipped off one of her waterproof Uggs. A bit bashfully, she took off her white sock, exposing a pale white foot. She put on the new boot and stood up.<br><br>‶How does it feel?‶<br><br>Gretchen looked down at the boot next to Tami's foot and wiggled her toes. ‶Strange. A little like cotton, but kind of like I'm in steel wool.‶<br><br>Tami looked down thoughtfully, in the process flicking a lingering drop of rain from her right nipple. ‶That's not necessarily a bad thing… It's good that it feels unique without being uncomfortable.‶<br><br>The two young women walked out of the dress lab and a bit down the hall, all the while looking at Gretchen's foot. They sat down in one of the little alcoves that dotted the hallways. Tami sat up cross-legged as Gretchen turned the boot as if modeling it.<br><br>This was a below ground level floor. High up on the wall was a little window half-encrusted with melting snow, sustaining the patter of raindrops.<br><br>‶It's bunched up a little bit at the toes,‶ Gretchen said.<br><br>‶That's just my fault. I was in such a hurry I didn't cut it right.‶<br><br>‶Do you think this material will ever get to Joe and Roger?‶<br><br>‶Actually I hope they're home before then. Joe comes back in three months.‶<br><br>‶Roger comes back in four. Oh Lord…‶ Gretchen shook her head. ‶I hope they're safe.‶<br><br>They sat awhile in silence. Tami clasped her fingers with her toes with the same ease that anyone else would clasp their hands.<br><br>As their minds wandered a bit, Gretchen looked at the nearby candy machine. Resist… resist… she was a chocolate addict and was trying to reform. Suddenly she realized that this was the perfect time. She had thought and thought and thought about it…<br><br>‶Tam, I'm going home the weekend after next. Want to come with me?‶<br><br>Tami looked at her for a moment. ‶What?‶<br><br>‶Come see my family. I've told them about you.‶<br><br>‶About me?‶<br><br>‶About you being my good friend,‶ she quickly said. ‶I'd love for you to meet my folks, and the rest of the clan. It's about a two hour drive. We can go Saturday morning, come back Sunday night.‶<br><br>‶You mean Jim-Bob and all that?‶<br><br>It was Gretchen's standing Waltons joke about her family. She was the second youngest of seven.<br><br>Gretchen looked down at the boot and then made herself look up at her naked friend.<br><br>Tami smiled. ‶If it's OK with you, it's OK with me.‶<br><br>This was a relief, but it also would have been a relief if Tami had said no. Gretchen was trying to treat Tami as a regular good friend. Her upbringing said it was just courteous to invite her. But then —<br><br>Suddenly Tami looked up at the window. ‶Whoa! This is the perfect time! Let's go outside!‶ She hopped out onto the floor with a determined double slap.<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶There's freezing cold puddles out there now. It's like the perfect way to test whether it holds heat!‶<br><br>Gretchen's mind quickly changed gears. ‶Tami, it's a mess out there.‶<br><br>‶Exactly. Who knows — this might be the last time it's that cold outside. It might be an early spring. And in the cold water the loss of heat will be the most acute. Wicking properties!‶<br><br>‶Uh, yes…‶ Gretchen had to admit that Tami was right. And so she followed her naked friend as they ran out of the building.<br><br>Unfortunately Gretchen had forgotten her umbrella, but a few minutes of freezing rain on her head was a small price to pay for what would be a great breakthrough. Tami took her by the hand out to the grass, where there were still soft patches of snow. Hunting around, they found a large puddle that looked especially deep.<br><br>And so it was. Planting the boot in it, the water came halfway up. There must have been a rut here. It was so wide that Gretchen had to stretch a bit to keep her other foot out on the relatively firm snow. Tami stood in the puddle next to the test boot, the water up past her ankles.<br><br>Tami said, loudly so as to be heard over the rain, ‶Does your foot feel cold?‶<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶Does… your… foot… feel… cold?‶<br><br>Gretchen saw Tami's bare foot submerged in the freezing cold water right next to the boot, icy mud swirling from between her toes.<br><br>‶Does your foot feel cold?‶ Tami shouted again. Sometimes Tami could get a little impatient and testy when she was excited.<br><br>‶Oh Tam…‶ Gretchen thought of her foot in the boot and sock and could not stop looking at Tami's bare toes in the icy puddle.<br><br>Tami appeared to recognize the problem. She climbed out of the watery rut and said, ‶I'll be at the doorway. Wait one minute if you can. Feel your foot!!‶<br><br>Gretchen took a deep breath and looked down, finally undistracted. She wiggled her toes again. Then closed her eyes, trying to feel. Yes, her foot was staying warm. There was no chill, or at least very little, possibly due to the poor fit of the sock. She felt the cold rain pelting her hair and face and vowed to endure…<br><br>Sixty seconds later she was splashing back to Thayer Hall, each step a great effort trying to lift the test boot, and the Ugg on the other foot, out of mud that was like glue. Tami was in the doorway as promised, but came out to the sidewalk to meet her. ‶Well?‶<br><br>Gretched smiled as if to bring warmth to her friend. ‶Yes! It's nice and warm and snuggly!‶<br><br>‶Yes! Yes!‶ The two friends, rain pouring down on their heads, hugged. Tami once again picked Gretchen up and twirled her around, the water from their wet hair spraying out in a double helix around them, prompting a second glance from the passersby as they trudged slowly through the wind and the icy rain in their umbrellas and boots and raincoats." },
      { title: "Chapter 14", content: "Rod was lucky this day. They were ready to work on the new dam, had all the kinks worked out, but the rain came and would not let up. There was no planning or paperwork to do while waiting; it had all been done. So he got to go home early.<br><br>Driving back home he realized how tired he was. He was doing better recently. Inspired by Tami's pep talk, he had quit trying to decide whether his boss was a good boss or a bad boss or whether he was being treated fairly or unfairly. Instead he decided to act like a major league rookie who knew he was lucky to be invited up to the big time and determined to do the best job he could. As a result things were going more smoothly. His boss seemed to be easing up on him.<br><br>Looking at his watch he saw that Tami would be in the middle of one of her ‶therapy‶ sessions over at the Chalfont Institute. He thought about stopping by. Dr. Kantor, a pleasant but boring man, had said hi to him now and then when he came to pick Tami up. He had also met Dr. Abu Jamal, who after Dr. Schnitzer retired had become the new director at Chalfont. A rather high-strung guy from Pakistan. Both were undoubtedly well-meaning, obviously feeling obligated to cure Tami after all that she had been through under their roof.<br><br>They had seemingly tried everything. Tami didn't say much about it, but when he pumped her for details she told him about the talking therapy, the behavior modification therapy, hypnosis, the testing of her skin responses. The last time he came by, Tami was in a lab room standing up on an exam table, stretched out into an ‶X‶, grasping a long metal bar near the ceiling, wires taped to her skin, while Dr. Kantor and his assistants positioned loops of fabrics around her body. He could see the goose bumps, the stiffening of her already erect nipples, even her pubic hair seemed to stand on end when the ‶covering‶ got too close. These therapies seemed very mild and tentative, but they were the experts, not him. Also, to be fair, they probably didn't want to risk causing any further harm.<br><br>He decided he was too tired to go to Chalfont and went straight home. He fell on the bed without taking off his clothes and was soon asleep.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>It was a scary, uncomfortable feeling. He felt decidedly out of place with his suit and attache case, following El Hamad down the stone steps. As special American envoy this was the most important assignment of his life. But thus far El Hamad had been rather chilly and almost brusque, with little of his famous charm.<br><br>The passageway got darker and the steps more uneven. A sentry followed him.<br><br>Yet another, increasingly narrow stairwell down, and the air got downright chilly. As they passed under a bare light bulb he could see his breath in little clouds. Finally they reached the rock bottom, the subbasement.<br><br>It took his eyes a while to adjust to the darkness. It was an enormous room divided by a stone wall. The floor was rocky and uneven, as if bedrock had been chipped into to create this level with no attempt to make a true floor. He could feel the pointy outcrops through his shiny, leather-soled shoes which slipped and bent as he tried to keep up.<br><br>He sensed her dark silhouette as they approached. And then was spooked by dull green flickers that turned out to be her eyes. The sentry lit an oil lamp on the wall.<br><br>It was recognizably Tami, but this naked girl was almost his height. Standing upright, legs apart, her dirty bare feet cuffed to rivets in the rock. Her skin was brown, in fact almost as dark as his own, contrasting with her green eyes in the flickering light. Her arms were drawn back, a heavy chain connecting her wrists to the wall behind. Her breasts were enormous, standing straight out like brown mountains over her concave tummy. Her nipples, gigantic and stiff in the cold, were pierced with rough thick iron rings three inches across that hung down in the chilly air. Below, one could dimly see her abundant pubic bush.<br><br>‶Irish,‶ El Hamad said. ‶Strong race. She could kill me with her bare hands, and probably wants to.‶ She looked at him with undisguised hatred, her tummy breathing in and out with her passion. Then as he feared, she turned her gaze on him.<br><br>‶What was her offense?‶ he said as blandly as he could.<br><br>El Hamad shrugged. ‶I forget.‶<br><br>He looked around. Except for them the entire level was empty. ‶Is she being punished?‶<br><br>‶No, this is her usual position when not performing hard labor.‶<br><br>‶Where is her cell?‶<br><br>El Hamad looked at him and waved his hand. ‶This IS her cell. She sleeps with one ankle cuffed.‶<br><br>There was no bed, no toilet. She slept naked on these pointy rocks?<br><br>‶It's very cold down here,‶ he said.<br><br>‶Like I told you, a strong race. She's been naked for three months now. Hard labor keeps her toned. Of course, we have a purpose.‶ El Hamad took out a flashlight and took him behind her. He gasped. Coming up out of the floor at an angle was a rusty iron shaft about two inches thick that disappeared between her taut butt cheeks.<br><br>As if to increase his consternation, El Hamad asked his sentry, ‶What's the penetration?‶<br><br>‶Eight inches.‶<br><br>Open-mouthed in astonishment, he just couldn't forsake his duty and said what he had to say. ‶You must be aware that this violates the Geneva Convention.‶<br><br>El Hamad laughed. ‶Oh really. And what country are you from?‶<br><br>He bit his lip. This was untenable. His country was aware of El Hamad's human rights abuses, and had been willing to look the other way because they needed his help. But now El Hamad was rubbing this outrage right in his face.<br><br>He saw a way out. This might be a vital interrogation. ‶What information do you hope to get out of her?‶<br><br>Another laugh. ‶This is not a spy movie.‶ A small recorder emerged from El Hamad's pocket. Resplendent in his full-dress uniform, he faced the the naked prisoner. She spat at him.<br><br>El Hamad laughed and wiped it off with a handkerchief. ‶Good thing we'd rather have you alive… Now confess to the bombing.‶<br><br>She glared at him, her huge breasts heaving, the rings rising and falling.<br><br>El Hamad slowly twisted one of the rings ninety degrees. She was stoic but by the time he twisted to 180 degrees she was clearly trying to hide her pain.<br><br>The recorder came out again. ‶You know the words to say. Whether you actually did it or not is of no moment. Say what needs to be said.‶<br><br>She refused. The sentry, with a hammer from his coat, struck the iron shaft fiercely. The clang reverberated through the dank empty basement. The naked prisoner tried to shift her feet and stifled a cry, her breasts bouncing ponderously. The pain in her abused sphincter and rectum must have been horrible.<br><br>She looked right at him with green fire in her eyes. She had not said a word. Was she demanding that he help her? Or condemning him for not doing so?<br><br>Now, the sound of rushing water from behind. He turned around — was the basement being flooded?<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rod awoke with a start. He found himself still in his suit and shoes, lying on the bed. He staggered to his feet, disoriented. He had had dreams about Tami before — sometimes as a naked superheroine, saving the world in comic book fashion from evil, sometimes as a naked Olympic swimmer whom he was coaching, often as a naked Queen on her throne whom he approached in supplication, even as a naked paper girl who delivered the newspaper every day. But this was the first time his dream-Tami had been imprisoned or abused.<br><br>It was past seven o'clock. He had been asleep for four hours. Glad he was in the comforting real world again, he lurched to the bathroom and the sound he knew so well, of Tami taking one of her bubble baths.<br><br>She had just turned the faucet off with her foot. This was one of those old-style free-standing tubs with legs. Lying fully submerged except for her head and her bent knees, her eyes closed, a little smile on her face. ‶Mmmmm…‶ Despite the bubbles he could see almost her entire body, her breasts buoyant.<br><br>She opened her eyes as if expecting him. He told her about his dream.<br><br>She giggled, a low, womanly giggle which made the water ripple. Lifting her feet up to the sides of the tub and wiggling her bubbly toes, she said, ‶Fortunately my circumstances are not quite that desperate.‶<br><br>He put the toilet cover down and sat next to the tub. He noticed the unadorned third toe and picked up the wedding ring she had she placed on the floor. ‶I think it's getting too tight,‶ she said. ‶It gets uncomfortable sometimes.‶<br><br>He looked down at her. ‶You don't seem to be gaining weight.‶<br><br>‶No,‶ she looked down at her tummy. ‶The rec center takes care of that.‶<br><br>Rod watched absently as Tami's nipples broke the surface and then submerged in the little ripples, and thought again about his dream. ‶You were in a dungeon. That was like at the pony farm, right?‶<br><br>‶No, I wouldn't call it a dungeon. They kept us in a stable with straw on the floor but everything there looked pretty expensive. The food was certainly better than here.‶<br><br>‶Ho ho,‶ Rod said with a smile. A reference to his disastrous attempt at lasagna last night. Which Tami, with her winter appetite, ate anyway.<br><br>‶So what were you working on today?‶<br><br>‶Dragging seedlings out to the campus lawn. It was a slippery, muddy mess in that rain. I fell three times. I needed this bath b-a-a-d.‶<br><br>‶No, not the grounds crew, I mean at Chalfont.‶<br><br>‶Galvanic skin tests.‶<br><br>Rod exhaled in exasperation.<br><br>‶And,‶ Tami said with a smile, ‶we got the polymer to thread. I made a boot out of it. Gretchen put her foot into a puddle and said it kept her warm.‶<br><br>‶Great! — So where is this headed?‶<br><br>‶Ling told me the government is interested. They might send us some things to sign.‶<br><br>‶Wow…‶<br><br>‶And not only that,‶ Tami said, ‶I got an interesting gift from a visitor. Look under the sink.‶<br><br>Rod at first did not know what this huge object was that he was dragging out of the cabinet, but as he supported it in his hands he suddenly looked at it in horror. ‶God… this isn't…‶<br><br>‶It's not exactly what they stuck in me. Mrs. Wickland says it's improved and they're not into punishment any more. There's a remote there too. Push the purple button.‶<br><br>Rod found the remote and dropped the huge tail in surprise as it buzzed. ‶So now this is a vibrator?‶<br><br>‶Ja. Sehr nett?‶ Which meant, ‶Very nice?‶<br><br>Rod held it in his hands. ‶I can't believe this whole wooden part went inside you.‶<br><br>‶I had had a lot of practice at the time.‶<br><br>Rod remembered Tami's account of the huge dildos pistoning into both her holes at Chalfont under McMasters's direction. ‶It seems impossible.‶<br><br>‶No, it's possible.‶<br><br>He thought again about the old plantation grounds, the pony girl system. That the slaves were there by choice made it in way worse. ‶What a sick enterprise. Playing master and slave.‶<br><br>‶I had a dream about it once that wasn't too bad.‶<br><br>‶Oh really. I suppose you were the lady of the manor?‶<br><br>‶No, I was the barefoot Irish kitchen girl. You were a field slave out picking cotton.‶<br><br>Rod cocked his eyebrow. A black person and a white person would have different ideas about such a dream.<br><br>‶We would wink at each other, and one day we both escaped into the countryside, made love under the stars, and built a little hut to live in.‶<br><br>‶If I was a field slave I wouldn't get a chance to see you, much less wink at you.‶<br><br>‶It was a dream, Rod!‶<br><br>Well maybe that was not so bad. Tami sat up in the tub, water coursing from her nipples, and kissed Rod's adorable shaved head. He watched as she settled back in. Her famous pubic fronds, buoyed by the water, waved to and fro like wheat in a lazy summer wind. Plum-colored wheat, of course.<br><br>‶Got home early?‶ she said, sliding down some more.<br><br>‶Yes. No work at the moment.‶<br><br>‶Me too. It's a night for chilling out.‶<br><br>He took one last look at her submerged charms and then started out the bathroom.<br><br>The ominous whoosh of water into a cave. He looked back and she had braced her feet against the sides with toes spread. He knew this well — she was a cobra rising to pounce. He tried to make a run for it and almost made it into the kitchen. But fifteen feet was well within her range. She raised her body up and a long thin squirt of bath water arced out from her womanly depths and hit him square in the back of his jacket. The female hunter-gatherer had once again arrowed her prey.<br><br>‶Damn,‶ he laughed. The only thing to do was swear revenge." },
      { title: "Chapter 15", content: "In the kitchen, his wet jacket drying on a chair, Rod puttered around for something to make for supper. It was his turn again. He decided on what he was good at, salad with hard boiled eggs, cheese, and a side of toast.<br><br>As he was getting out the lettuce he heard the splashing and dripping of water. Tami was getting out of her bubble bath. She used to try to invite him in with her but the tub wasn't really big enough and, besides, she liked the water really hot, which he found suffocating.<br><br>‶Aiee! Damn!‶ she suddenly shouted.<br><br>When he got there he saw his dripping nude wife looking at a big white towel on the floor.<br><br>‶That thing is like fire!‶ she said. She reached down for it but drew her hand away at the touch.<br><br>Rod picked it up. It felt like the same old towel as always. The two searched for an explanation. ‶Maybe you're allergic to the detergent. Did you buy a different brand? I know I haven't.‶<br><br>‶No.‶<br><br>He went to the linen closet. Unfortunately their other towels (all four of them) were in the dirty clothes hamper, leaving just some scratchy wash cloths. He threw three to Tami. In spite of his concern, Rod always found it sexy seeing her dry herself off.<br><br>He put the white towel in the hamper, intending on doing the wash later, then went back to the kitchen. Now a voice from the living room. ‶Rod.‶<br><br>He found her there sitting cross-legged on the upholstered couch, leaning against a pillow.<br><br>‶I don't feel so good. I feel… I don't know, like I'm going to throw up.‶<br><br>Now he was really concerned. In all the time he knew her Tami had not once gotten sick. In Pilgrim Hall she was famous for it. They both figured it was because the constant exposure to the elements had toughened her. It was something she cited with pride during her embrace of ‶the theory of nudism‶ last year.<br><br>He didn't know what to do but she seemed so confused as to be helpless. He pulled her up by the hand and led her to the kitchen. Once on the cold tile floor she sighed. Then she sat down on it, breathing deeply. She opened her eyes and seemed to have recovered. Then she drew a glass of water.<br><br>‶Rod,‶ she said, ‶let's get some air.‶<br><br>Tami led him out the back door. The half moon was out. The forecast had been wrong; it looked like it was freezing up again tonight. They stood on the re-freezing crusty snow in the back yard. He watched as she took some more deep breaths, exhaling in little clouds of condensation, over her nipples that were stiffening with the cold. Wisps of mist emanated from her body, still hot and moist from the bath. Then she squatted and peed. She never had a bashful kidney when it was just her and Rod, or some of her close friends. Sometimes they would stand in a circle around her, conversation going on without interruption as she relieved herself.<br><br>Rod and Tami both watched the steaming yellow hole that formed in the snow.<br><br>As the jet of urine slackened she looked up and said, ‶I want some eggs. Let's go eat at the Plaza.‶<br><br>In this town, that meant the Plaza Diner, three blocks away on Water Street. The snow crunched under her feet as she slowly sauntered to the side gate with an even gait.<br><br>‶Wait, Babe, while I get my coat.‶ Rod also changed into his boots.<br><br>In a minute they were walking hand in hand down the small side street. He tried not to look over at her. Fortunately she seemed OK. By the time they got to the diner and she waved to Theo, the owner, and they got their favorite table at the back, it was back to being a normal night.<br><br>It would be too much to call the three-eggs-and-steak plate the ‶Tami winter special‶, but that would have been appropriate, because hardly anyone else ordered it. Rod picked at his own pancakes as she started wolfing it down.<br><br>He brought up something that had been bothering him. ‶I still can't believe you were so… casual about accepting that tail thing, that monstrosity, as a gift from that lawyer. Don't you remember what they did to you?‶<br><br>‶It was mistaken identity. Anyway, it seems like it was a hundred years ago.‶ She leaned over and rubbed his scalp like it was a Buddha's belly and she was wishing for good luck. In the process her breast leaned into her potatoes. She wiped it off with a napkin as she said, ‶What am I supposed to do, relive it over and over? If I dwelt on all that old stuff I'd go crazy.‶<br><br>She had a point. That summer was three years ago, almost. She was just turning 19 then. From 19 to 22 is a long period in a person's life. More than 22 to 25 was, as with him. It was a condescending thought, and Tami had been through enough trauma and shame for several lifetimes. But nonetheless true.<br><br>Rod wondered about that dream he had. What did it mean? That Tami was being tortured inside and it was up to him to help? Yet she seemed so well-adjusted to what life had handed her. Except for Henry Ross and Dean Jorgon and a few others, all of whom were gone, she had forgiven everyone involved in her freshman year torments. As she put it once, they were simply under mistaken impressions created by a couple of bad people. She was even on good terms with Homer Winant now, that clever creep. And who was Rod to say that this peace of mind was not real? It certainly seemed real to him. She never had unsettling dreams, like the one he just had.<br><br>As she sipped orange juice she giggled.<br><br>‶What.‶<br><br>‶I was just thinking — what if I wore that tail around campus?‶<br><br>All Rod could think of was how uncomfortable it would be, but he saw how it might be funny and played along. ‶Maybe just to parties?‶<br><br>‶Or special occasions. Like graduation.‶<br><br>Now he did laugh. ‶Your valedictorian speech.‶<br><br>He thought about sitting in the audience, using the remote to bring her to orgasm after orgasm as she spoke. Maybe he shouldn't be turned on, considering her freshman year experiences. But still…<br><br>Stuffed for now, Tami sat back and put her feet up on the opposite seat, on each side of Rod. She fondled the sides of his jeans with her toes.<br><br>‶How are your fans doing?‶<br><br>‶Attentive as ever. Spica keeps bringing up the idea of an after-hours get-together.‶<br><br>‶Who?‶<br><br>‶Spica. She's a freshman. I don't think you've met her yet.‶<br><br>‶Is this the 'Tami-thon' idea again?‶<br><br>‶Kind of.‶<br><br>The two of them had never gotten each other's views on this long-standing proposal because neither was sure what they thought about it themselves. But now Rod found himself saying, ‶If they want to do it at our house, that's O.K. I'd like to be there, though.‶<br><br>Tami looked at Rod. ‶It sounds too, like, intimate for you not to be there. Think of it as having Jen and Leisha visiting. The expanded version.‶<br><br>‶I don't know if we can afford all that fine wine.‶<br><br>‶Not for me.‶<br><br>‶No?‶<br><br>‶No, I prefer keeping my senses sharp. Like when I'm with you.‶<br><br>So there he had it. The marathon, multi-tongue party idea had been OK with Tami all along.<br><br>Tami said, ‶You know, about this tail… If it does what Ms. Wickland says it does, it would come in handy, like the bra and panties from Chalfont.‶ Which she couldn't wear any more.<br><br>The tail would certainly mean less work for him every night. He could just watch, or maybe work the remote, while her immense sexual thirst was quenched, instead of doing all that work of humping from below, from above, licking, sucking, always holding back, managing her orgasms so to speak. Instead, he could hold her hand as she spasmed to her heart's (or clit's) content, and just ‶come in‶ for the finish.<br><br>‶The important thing is that I am with you, Babe.‶<br><br>Tami inserted a sausage in a hole in Rod's pancake, which made him chuckle. ‶You know I was doing all sorts of tasks while wearing that tail thing. Chopping branches, pulling buggies…‶<br><br>‶Babe, please — I don't want to hear about it.‶<br><br>‶My point is, sometimes I think it's all work for you and all pleasure for me.‶<br><br>‶I don't have your capacity.‶<br><br>‶Still. The tail will free up my hands and mouth and everything, to give you pleasure.‶<br><br>‶You DO give me pleasure.‶ At least as much as he could stand, considering he could only come once or maybe twice a night. Sundays, which they tried to reserve for being alone, he could usually come four times during the course of the day.<br><br>‶What I'm thinking of is the TL's,‶ Tami said. ‶They don't ever want pleasure for themselves. All they want is to make me come a lot. And it's not like they're playing me like a pinball machine like you say. It's kind of selfless. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but the way they get into it seems almost mystical.‶ She finished the last of her toast and then looked out the window into the black night. ‶I'm too much on the receiving end. I should devote myself more to pleasuring you. Be an RL. A Rod Licker.‶<br><br>Rod did not know what to make of this strange turn of the conversation. After a moment, he changed the subject.<br><br>‶How's Joe doing?‶<br><br>‶O.K. It's a crummy situation all around but at least he's not getting shot at and he enjoys what he's doing.‶<br><br>‶And what's that? He's with the 101st, right?‶<br><br>‶Yeah, but he's in ordnance. The guys who repair stuff and put it back together… I'm still amazed that Joe found his calling so quick. He used to be a total klutz mechanically. I told you about the time I had to run all the way to church to jump-start the car on Christmas morning because he didn't know how.‶<br><br>Yes, Rod remembered that story, from her freshman year.<br><br>‶And his grades were never very good. Then after high school he decided to enlist. He was inspired by 9/11, of course, but then when they put him in mechanic school he suddenly took right to it. Really the first thing he's ever tried that he was a 'natural' at. . . If only they could have kept him at Killeen, instead of going to Iraq. They're really stretched for troops.‶<br><br>‶Yes. I hear. My cousin's there.‶ Actually a rather distant cousin, from relatives in Detroit.<br><br>‶Oh right, I forgot. Well a friend of Joe's tried to get a hardship transfer back to the States because his uncle died. He couldn't get it. You have to be practically the only remaining source of support for 23 disabled children. Well,‶ she said, stirring her coffee, ‶at least Joe'll be back soon.‶<br><br>‶May?‶<br><br>‶Either that or early June.‶<br><br>‶I'm curious. How did your father react to his picking the Army instead of the Navy?‶<br><br>Tami chuckled, while wiping a drop of ketchup off her nipple. ‶That business about competition between the services is really not true. At least not with Dad.‶<br><br>The diner was almost empty on this winter night. Tami's position at their table was always facing away from the door. This way, if an out-of-towner walked in, which was unusual, he would see only her bare shoulders and naturally conclude that she was in a strapless dress. Now Rod saw a couple of scary-looking guys come in and sit at the counter. Maybe not scary. They were more like goofy and loud, and Tami's shoulders caught their attention.<br><br>Rod choreographed the situation as he usually did. Before they got too curious he asked for the check, then got up and made a show of flapping his coat around before putting it on, blocking the view. Tami got the signal and shot out the back door. Rod followed and the two walked back to the house along the path hidden behind a row of shrubs.<br><br>When they got back they sat around in the kitchen while Rod examined the tail minutely and tried the remote. There was a purple button but also a small touch-pad like a laptop has. Running the finger along the touch pad caused a little bump to travel along the shaft at the same speed. They both laughed at this, amazed at the ingenuity.<br><br>She got up on the table on all fours. Maybe some day she could accept this huge thing inside her again, but he didn't dare try that yet. Instead he got out one of Tami's selection of regular size dildoes, dabbed it with lubricant, and slowly worked it into her anus.<br><br>He hadn't done work in Tami's back door in a while. For now, he satisfied himself with using the tail as a big vibrator, pressing it against her clit as he worked the dildo in and out. He was rewarded with several short, sharp climaxes. Small climaxes for Tami, but no less satisfying to see.<br><br>Back in bed, he tried training the vibrating tail on her clit again as he slowly screwed her from below. Unfortunately the vibrations on his dick were too direct and his dick went numb, which was pretty funny. He ended up not coming himself, finishing the evening by licking Tami to several long, slow, rolling orgasms." },
      { title: "Chapter 16", content: "Melissa, the new TL, smiled as she sat down at one of the chilly concrete tables in the Student Union courtyard. Tall, blonde, beautiful, she looked like a model and instinctively dressed like one, this time in a black carriage coat with blue scarf, black snow cap, straight leg jeans and long black boots. Every passing guy gave her a long look, but she was used to that and ignored them, focused on the object of her desire and thanking her luck.<br><br>It had become cloudy and a bit windy, but the courtyard was still filled with students and faculty during this lunchtime hour. Some were sitting at the round tables, some were standing, but none were at the table in the middle except Tami Smithers, lying on her back right on top, arms and legs spread out, snoozing.<br><br>The morning had been sunny and gloriously warm, a preview of the spring that was still some weeks away. Melissa had heard that Tami had taken an early lunch with some friends, sitting cross-legged on the table as she often did, and then as they left dropped off into one of her famous midday naps. When Melissa heard the news, the sun had disappeared, the clouds had come out, the temperature dropped. She had rushed over. Fortunately the cold hadn't awakened Tami yet.<br><br>This was not an unusual scene and the people in the courtyard took the naked slumberer in stride, almost as if she were a sculpture of a naked woman that was always there. They drank coffee, ate, chatted about their business, only a few glancing at the naked form, mostly passing guys who stopped by on a pretense but were careful to get going lest they be thought gawking. A few brave persons began to sit at Tami's table, careful not to be too near a bare foot. In the process of turning in her sleep, Tami had been known to kick over sodas and worse, one fine autumn afternoon having upturned a plate of spaghetti into a professor's lap. All the while without waking.<br><br>She was bound to wake up soon. Continuing to nap in this chill would be impossible even for her. Melissa watched, entranced, at the sight of pubic hair being ruffled by wind in the midst of the crowded courtyard. Tami stretched and turned onto her side, facing her. Her nose twitched, then little twitches of the hands. Tami's pinky toes extended. Her breasts trembled ever so slightly, the stiff nipples pointing right at Melissa. Tami must be dreaming. What was she dreaming of? There was always speculation. Maybe she was dreaming of running. Maybe of gymnastics, her old sport. The most common speculation, oddly, was the most ridiculous: that she was dreaming of wearing clothes and shoes.<br><br>Now Tami lay on her back again, legs straight out, arms stretched over her head, sticking out from the end of the table. Her nipples poked up to the sky. It was hard to believe that she could sleep like this, bare skin scraping against cold concrete, but everyone knew she had slept on all kinds of rough surfaces during her legendary cross-country journey. Now her legs separated again, one knee slightly bent. Melissa could see the lower lips parting ever so slightly, perhaps the nub of her clit showing, she wasn't sure. Tami's mouth opened and Melissa suppressed a giggle as Tami started snoring. There were other smiles too. On the inhale Tami sounded like a revving motorcycle.<br><br>Now that guy in the wheelchair from the administration, whom everyone called Homer, wheeled up with a tall guy in a suit and with Assistant Dean Congi. All were wearing overcoats, Congi in suede gloves. They stationed themselves in front of Tami, practically between her spread legs, and chatted, then turned to her as if expecting her to wake.<br><br>Wake she did, cutting off in mid-snore, opening her eyes, blinking back into a consciousness of her surroundings, then lifting her head to say hi to the three with a total lack of surprise. With her legs still spread, she spoke a little in that position, just her head lifted. To look her in the eye they probably had to look right past her open pussy. Yet Tami made no attempt to close her legs or change position until a minute later, when she laid her head back, stretched like a yawning cat, then sat cross-legged to continue the conversation. Midway through she gave Melissa a thril by idly scratching one of her big, dark brown, permanently erect nipples, making her breasts dance for a second.<br><br>The exchange was obviously cordial, though Melissa couldn't make out what they were talking about. Soon Homer, Congi, and the tall guy left. It was time to make her move.<br><br>She decided not to be hokey with any ‶my Queen‶ business, it being her first time. ‶Hi Tami,‶ she said, standing next to the table. She slowly extended her hand, being unable to resist a quick glance down at those nipples whose sensitivity made further words unnecessary. Tami smiled a royal-looking smile and allowed Melissa to help her off the table. As Tami stood up she brushed bits of concrete grit off her butt cheeks. Then Melissa led her from the courtyard, up toward the library walkway. Tami kept up with her as they went up silently.<br><br>Tami had nothing with her. She kept her things in a locker in the Union with a combination lock, walking without carrying anything whenever possible. Nobody knew why this was. Maybe it reminded her of her journey across the country with no money or clothes or things, just her bare body. It just added to her reputation, the icon of female strength that the TL's all but worshipped.<br><br>Melissa had planned it well and the area turned out to be deserted. It was the series of concrete tables on the edge of the big plaza outside the upper library level, near what was technically the main entrance but rarely used because the whole plaza was so out of the way. She guided Tami to one of the tables and sat Tami down at it while she herself sat on the bench.<br><br>Tami's pussy was at her eye level and she looked up as if asking permission. Upon seeing the silent smile Melissa began. She kissed the plum-colored forest, the opening to the royal palace, then stood up to kiss and then tenderly suck each nipple. Tami closed her eyes, her head back, and began to breathe deeply. Melissa grabbed one bare foot in each hand and intertwined her fingers with the rough cold toes. The toes clasped back with amazing strength.<br><br>Now a gentle series of kisses down the tan, concave midriff, on the navel, and down the thickening forest. A hot breath on the lower lips. Melissa's hands wrapped around the taut butt cheeks and her breath quickened as she inhaled the first scent of Tami's secretions. Her tongue inserted, at first pointed and now flat against the inner lips, and she got her first taste of the famous nectar. Not sweet, not bitter, a mellowed yet distinctive essence, grown-up womanly and frisky girlish, so hard to describe yet so immediately recognizable, this essence of female. She burrowed deeper, remembering what she had learned, flat tongue side to side, regulating her own breathing, and now, an occasional swipe of the clit, rewarded by the little gasps above.<br><br>She continued for a couple of minutes before a slight grinding of Tami's pelvis told her it was time to ‶take her up‶. More determined, deeper burrowing, now up and down to include the clit, the nerve-rich uniqueness of the female, the only body part devoted exclusively to sexual pleasure, and now Tami found her own rhythm, and the two women synchronized their breathing, together in the ancient dance, and the naked goddess now cried out over and over, gasping as if for air but also to the skies and to the earth. Now the bare feet braced against Melissa's thighs on the bench and the great arching of the pelvis, the inhaling of air between clenched teeth, and now the great waves beat upon the shore, one after the other. Melissa was with her all the way, spasm after spasm, holding on for dear life, as if hugging a little motor boat bouncing across a choppy sea, as Tami took her up with her. The last irregular spasm spent itself, and now Melissa slackened just a bit, then returned to the flat tongue rhythm, keeping the naked girl on the plateau.<br><br>They were together up in the sky, whirling around this axis of tongue and clit. Now Melissa darted in, way in, and pulled the butt cheeks apart and in toward her, and her Queen moaned continuously as the tongue melded into her femininity, as if the tongue reached all the way in to snake around each ovary to caress and stimulate it, to secret itself into the cervix and all the way up the uterus, to the essence of the female and her gift of life. Melissa felt a hot sweat on her face, hotness under her many clothes, privileged to be present at this sacred moment, as Tami crested again and exploded with a loud cry.<br><br>Tami and Melissa traveled through the ages, looked down on empires and civilizations as they rose and fell, the projects and intrigues of men, while they themselves flew on, ageless and all-knowing and indestructible. Their joy was the joy of the universe, the pulsating, orgasmic surge of life. They were the sun and earth, earth and moon, and now they were a double sun revolving around each other, setting the universe ablaze with light, spiraling out radiation and hot sun spirit. . . Tami caressed Melissa's hair, her supple feet wrapped around and caressed the coat and scarf around her shoulders and back, the embrace mutual.<br><br>Thousands of years went by, and countless eruptions, as like a volcano Tami quaked and subsided and quaked and subsided. Now Melissa felt the call of ambition. She inserted her fingers way, way in, then gently hooked upward, finding the little twin grapes and pressed them toward her tongue. Tami lurched. ‶Ohh!! Y – yes!‶ Melissa tongued the clit, then pressed, working the clit and G-spot like a see-saw, as the pelvis shook and shook some more in unbearable escalating tension.<br><br>Now Tami's legs shot out straight with terrific force as if dealt a death blow. She shrieked as the first jolt hit, the first of a new and stronger series, and Melissa wrapped her arms more fully around her butt in a looser yet more all-encompassing embrace. Shriek after shriek echoed off the cold concrete architecture of the big deserted plaza. Melissa could not keep count but imagined someone might be watching, counting the contractions of this prolonged orgasm with awe and envy. With each jolt Melissa felt herself shooting up to the heavens with Tami like an astronaut in a rocket.<br><br>After it was over Melissa looked up, tongue still inserted in its home, to survey the quietness of Tami now lying back in rest on the table, breasts heaving with the recapture of oxygen, sweat drying, her body a strewn landscape after a violent storm. Now for a little comedy. Melissa flicked up to the clitoris to see Tami's whole body jolt upward. Another flick, another jolt, making Tami giggle, her belly and breasts jiggling. More flicks, in a steadily quickening rhythm, and now Tami's body jerked and jerked and she laughed and trilled like a bird, and the Queen bestowed her last orgasm on her subject like that, light-hearted trilling and laughing as she went up and then came down, like the last act of a Shakespearean drama, after all the heights and depths of drama, a little comedic epilogue to make the audience go home happy.<br><br>Melissa rested the side of her head on Tami's forest, like a child at her mother's breast. Now she separated, lying back on the back of the bench. Her tongue was sore, but only a little, and her whole body, recovering from the experience, was pleasantly tired and a little sweaty. She became aware of the chilly wind again and was grateful for the coolness. She held her hand up to her nose to whiff the drying scent. She had never felt so satisfied, so… fulfilled.<br><br>Now she found Tami hugging her. ‶Thanks,‶ the naked Queen said softly, ‶I'm glad you came.‶ After a tender moment Tami separated and said, ‶What time to you have?‶<br><br>‶Uh… Five minutes to two.‶ It seemed like but moments but in fact they had been in commmunion for almost half an hour.<br><br>‶Gotta get going. See you around.‶ And with that Tami sprinted off across the plaza, pumping her arms like an athlete, her soles a sandpapery whisper on the concrete. She passed a few people coming this way and waved as they waved back. Just before she turned out of site at the far end, her fingers scraped the back of her head, as if to unstick hair that had gotten sweated on. And then with a final flick of an upturned sole she was gone.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Marianne watched, more or less helplessly, as Tami hefted the big trunk onto the top of her little BMW. At least she was of some assistance when it came to tying it down, holding the rope down with her thumb as Tami did the knots. Soon the loading was done and Marianne, up until now a TL, stood there in her sweater coat and jeans and sneakers, car keys in her hand, looking down at Tami's bare feet and legs on the wet gravelly shoulder, then again at her car, aimed down High Street in the direction of the interstate ten miles away.<br><br>‶It still seems odd to quit in the middle of your last semester,‶ Tami said.<br><br>‶It's what I should do, Tam. My mother needs me at home.‶<br><br>‶She has the nurse.‶<br><br>‶Yes but she needs ME. I should be there. I think of all the times she took care of me when I was sick, all those years as a single parent, just me and her. Now it's my turn to take care of her.‶<br><br>That her mother would likely recover from her latest relapse was known to both of them. Of course Tami did not point this out.<br><br>‶It was you who put me in a place where I could make this decision, Tami,‶ Marianne said, deciding this was the time to look her full in the face. ‶When I first came here I was a spoiled kid, only interested in myself. To make any kind of sacrifice was just not something that would have occurred to me.‶<br><br>Tami did not correct her, tactfully, because both of them knew it was true.<br><br>‶But with you I learned selflessness. At first I thought Georgene was some kind of New Age airhead for talking about the mysticism of licking you. But as I got better at it, and more into it, and you took me up with you to see the whole world at a glance, all around us, without having to turn, with you holding onto me to keep me from falling, my perspective expanded. It went way beyond sex. You taught me how to give of myself. How one gets more out of giving than out of taking. Any good mother knows that. As I now realize. And it is high time I become a good mother to my own mother.‶<br><br>‶Best of luck,‶ Tami said. ‶Stay in touch. Tell your mother I said hi and we pray for her.‶<br><br>Marianne reached around Tami's bare shoulders and gave her the biggest, teariest hug she ever gave. ‶Bye, my Queen,‶ she said with a chuckle and a sniffle. She got in the car and turned the key and then stuck her head out the window to say a few more words.<br><br>She saw Tami waving in the rear view mirror and then the road curved and her permanently naked friend was out of her line of vision. Fortunately as she reflected on her long drive home, down past Brattleboro and Springfield and Hartford, the words she left Tami with, well-rehearsed, remained the exact words she had wanted to say. They were the words of a 21-year-old who was trying to be profound but was utterly sincere. ‶If we are lucky, we meet someone who shows us who we are, what the really important things are in this life, and how to pursue them in a way that is honest and worthwhile. It is hard to say in words because it cannot be taught in words, just by example. In the life that happens to be mine, that person was you, Tami Smithers.‶" },
      { title: "Chapter 17", content: "Homer Winant wheeled himself into the Recreation Center atrium, the big, high-roofed arena that held all the center's equipment, the weight machines, the gymnastics area, the pool, and the volleyball court, with an oval track running around everything. He liked to come here every once in a while, as he did now on this cloudy late winter evening, to see if everything was in order, the equipment in shape, the heat on.<br><br>He wheeled with his hands, hating those mechanized wheelchairs, and wore his trademark ‶Grafton Transmissions‶ baseball cap. But he was still in his suit, being a college bigwig now. He was the Assistant Dean for Administration, in charge of the physical plant, the dorms, the meal plans. As he put it, ‶I keep the lights on around here.‶ Actually he was just the ‶Acting‶ Assistant Dean; he did not have the advanced degree for a permanent appointment, despite having been encouraged to get one. Sitting in classes always bored him. And his job was not in jeopardy. When old Hicks finally retired, they were forced to admit that Homer Winant, who had been doing most of Hicks's job anyway, was the logical replacement. He knew the campus inside out. And he ‶knew where the bodies were buried‶.<br><br>Tonight the rec center was a sweaty cacophony, the thumping of sneakered feet along the track, the grunts coming from the weight machines and the clanking of metal, the soft patter of chalked hands and feet from the gymnasts on the parallel bars and on the mats. Homer wheeled up toward the most arresting feature of the rec center, set up on a raised platform overlooking everything else: a double treadmill of the kind once used for water power, with bars added overhead for the hands to push up on. The little sign called it the ‶full body flexer‶, but to the students at Campbell-Frank, it was known as ‶the Beast‶.<br><br>Tonight there was a small cluster of students hanging out in front of the treadmill, Georgene, Myra, Spica, Melissa, Sessu, Jeane and Tom. All dressed in the sweats, socks and sneakers required here. Homer wheeled up to them.<br><br>‶What's up?‶<br><br>It was apparent that they were having a conversation which ceased when Homer approached.<br><br>‶Not much, Homer,‶ Tom said with easy familiarity. ‶How are you?‶<br><br>Homer glanced back at the weight machines. ‶I might try some dumbbell work later on,‶ he said. ‶You, why don't you use this? It's a fine machine, if I do say so myself.‶ Which was true. Originally trod by Tami Smithers for that electricity generation project three years ago, the treadmill was designed by him to also provide a full-body workout.<br><br>He still congratulated himself on getting Hicks to agree to move it to the rec center. Better than have it gather dust in the Dixon Mill to look like evidence against him after the Tami Smithers situation blew up. He had also noticed that Ms. Smithers, at the time a sophomore, was developing a bit of a tummy and was freaking out about it. It got installed, and after some hesitation she became the most frequent user. And, along with everyone else, he noticed that the naked girl's tummy quickly slimmed back down, for which she could only have been grateful. Again, a stroke of genius on his part.<br><br>He now appeared to have her trust. He was aware, through his extensive grapevine, that her husband considered him a ‶clever creep‶. But the husband was graduated and off campus. Someday Tami Smithers would be too.<br><br>‶It's pretty hard work to get this thing moving,‶ Jeane said.<br><br>‶There's a dial, you can set it for as wimpy as you want,‶ Homer said, waving to the controls he had installed.<br><br>‶It's still hard,‶ Myra said. ‶That's why we call it the Beast.‶<br><br>‶Weenies. And don't call it that, you'll hurt its feelings,‶ he said, looking up to it as if pacifying a huge, well, Beast. ‶I'll see you, I've got to do real man things like sit in front of a TV and drink beer,‶ Homer said. As usual, he amused his audience. In fact he wheeled toward the rec center office, to shoot the breeze with the attendant.<br><br>Tom, a tall, skinny kid with wild hair and an attempt at a beard, leaned against the treadmill and looked up at the bars. Jeane looked at him and said, ‶Well, my manly man?‶<br><br>It was not that the treadmill was hard to turn, at least not on the lightest setting. Few admitted it, but most students were just too bashful for it. It was the setup of the thing, two treadmills three feet apart, with bars over each for the hands to push on. It stretched you into an ‶X‶ and pushed your chest and crotch forward. And it was on a platform to boot, easily seen from any point in the atrium. Even through sweats and underclothes, it exposed a guy's — or girl's — endowments, or lack thereof, to the whole world.<br><br>Tom, being dared by his girlfriend, smirked and climbed up. He planted one sneakered foot on each treadmill and put his hands on the bars. Jeane looked up at his crotch. ‶Oh baby,‶ she said.<br><br>What guy could not proceed, given such encouragement? He pushed down with his left foot and pushed up with his right hand. It took a loud grunt but he got it to move. The double treadmill slowly turned as Tom looked forward into the far distance, obviously too shy to look down at his friends as they stared intently. He felt like he was shoving his package out into everyone's face. But now he looked down at Jeane with a little smile.<br><br>There was a general turning of heads around them and the friends knew what that meant. Nobody slid in here faster than Tami, who needed no ID to get in and had no need to go to the locker room to change. She was easy to see once you turned to the weight machine area. Clanking away on the shoulder press, the total bareness of skin easy to pick out in the sea of sweatshirts and sneakers and shorts.<br><br>Myra and Sessu ambled over first. They said hi, idly watching Tami's breasts vibrate as their naked friend, on her back, hefted 120 pounds with only a moderate amount of effort, her plum-colored pubic hair almost in their faces between the legs that splayed apart at the end of the bench, her bare feet flat on the floor. Tami said a quick hi but then started focusing on her exertions and Myra and Sessu, perhaps shamed into exercising, found things to do on the other machines. Those nearby who glanced over saw Tami's face start to get red, her breathing get louder, as she continued her reps. Like any dedicated exerciser, once she got into the reps she was in her own world.<br><br>Seesu tried to read as much as he could into the little smile Tami had sent in his direction. He was afraid he was still a little on the outs with her, a rare situation here on campus. Only Lorinda and some of her immature friends were not on Tami's good side, who had gotten such a kick out of the teasing and abuse they had put the naked girl through. But lately even they had been a little subdued. Lorinda herself, now a senior like Tami, had even gotten into student government a little and even found herself in meetings with her. But according to her roommate, Jeane's friend Celine, she was still ‶a nasty bitch‶ to live with.<br><br>Sessu's concern had arisen from a recent incident. He hung out with the TL's and it was no secret that he wanted to be one, but as a male his desires had to be sublimated. So he hit upon a solution. He had spent some weeks hearing the TL's talk about a Tami-thon — a long session with all of them licking and sucking every part of Tami's body — and that had given him an idea. An architecture major, he had privileges at the metal shop and he spent several late nights staring at all that tubing, then once the idea was in his head he roughed out the drawings and got to work.<br><br>Not that the Tami-thon would ever happen. Georgene had hinted at something like it during one of Tami's pass-bys at the Student Union and Tami had seemed turned off. Not that the proposal was ever spelled out directly. The Queen's permission was never directly asked for. They were too afraid the answer would be ‶no‶ and they wanted to hold onto the fantasy.<br><br>So it was a bold stroke, perhaps do-able only by someone who could never participate, when Sessu asked Tami to come with him to the metal lab because he had something to show her. The TL's went with him as he escorted her to the art building and down the hallway scented with acetylene and burnt wood. She must have thought he had made a sculpture of her, based on the many drawings he did of her when she sat chatting at the Union.<br><br>She was puzzled as he introduced her to the jumble of tubing on the floor. Then, taking off his jacket, he eagerly got to work, fitting this tube into that, banging some struts into place with the ballpeen hammer, climbing on top of the lower rungs to put the upper crossbars in place, then the final touch of screwing the cushioned wood seats onto the four threaded uprights.<br><br>The structure was a bit taller than he was and, after shoving it to and fro to show how sturdy it was, he hopped onto it, his arms and legs stretched out into an X, his legs slightly forward as he bent at the hips, his boots resting on cross-bars. Now Myra and Rosaria took off their coats and got into the raised seats a little to the sides so that their faces were on each side of his chest. Jeane got into the seat behind so that she was staring right at his butt. Georgene got into the plushest seat, so that she was eye level with his crotch. Not that she looked at it, or the considerable hardness that had developed there. She turned her head and, like the rest, looked back at Tami, who stood with her hands at her side, one foot sideways on the dusty floor, silent.<br><br>‶Forgive me for taking your throne temoparily, my Queen,‶ Sessu said in his Japanese accent. ‶But I hope you approve of what I made for you. Think of it as the seating arrangement for your court.‶<br><br>Its purpose was perfectly obvious. With Tami perched as Sessu currently was, Myra and Rosaria could comfortably suck her nipples for as long as they wanted. Georgene, or whoever sat there, could sit before Tami's crotch and suck and lick. And Jeane could sit forward, arms resting on Tami's thighs, and noodle around in the rear chamber of the palace.<br><br>Tami stood stock still. Then her eyes got wet and she looked upset. Then she blinked a few times and said, ‶Uh . . . Thanks . . . Sessue . . . that's . . . interesting. Gotta go.‶ And she turned and walked quickly out, and from hearing the receding slapping of her feet they could tell she almost ran out of the building.<br><br>They were stunned. What to make of that? They were in a funk for two days, until finally the TL's couldn't resist their horniness any longer and went back to licking Tami, for which she seemed grateful. As for Sessu he was depressed all week. He thought about apologizing to Tami, but felt like she wouldn't wanted to be reminded. As for why she had reacted that way to his invention, they really had no clue.<br><br>That was a month ago. Since then he had gotten good signals from Tami as if all were forgiven, like smiling when he kissed her knee in the Union last week. And now this little ‶hi‶.<br><br>Tami finished her 50 on the shoulder press, then went to the bench press, the pectoral fly, with her hard nipples sticking out halfway across the atrium, and now was on the hip adductor.<br><br>Who could not watch? Sitting upright as the weights clanked up and down behind her, her legs went way, way, way apart, as far as the machine allowed, almost a ballet dancer's split. Guys came by and looked down, then said hi as they passed. Tami sometimes acknowledged them, sometimes not, being too focused. By now a thin sheen of sweat covered her, as if someone had atomized water over every inch of her body.<br><br>Tom and Jeane sauntered by. Tom was sweating too from his five minutes of agony on the Beast. He looked down into Tami's crotch before waving at her.<br><br>It was a good long look, maybe five seconds. In the well-lit gym he could see inside the lower lips that were well open as the weights pulled Tami's legs apart, the redness of the cave within. Every guy on campus was familiar with the sight of the interior of Tami's pussy. Mentally they compared it with that of their own girlfriends, if they had one. Jeane, like most Campbell-Frank women, had come to accept ‶the long look‶; it was practically a reflex for the average male. Tom told Jeane that he fantasized, not about Tami, but about her being naked like Tami was, and Jeane believed him.<br><br>Tami tolerated the looks too with an easy humor. Just so long as the guy was polite and it didn't go on to extended gawking.<br><br>Forty minutes later activity in the atrium was muted as Tami was into the last stages of her workout on the Beast. As she always did, she had put it on the heaviest setting. Arms and legs apart, heaving out sweat in waves that filled the whole room with the scent of her exertion, hands pushing up, her toes curling over the blades as her bare feet pushed down . . . those gathered around felt privileged to see such a perfect specimen of the female form as they examined her from every angle, some looking up at the straining breasts, others down at her concave tummy, or at the muscles of her thighs and calves, the strong feet, others looking from behind at her bare shoulders and tight butt, sweat running down her back between her cheeks, then emerging in rivulets down her legs. Spica, standing right in front, made no secret of smacking her lips.<br><br>The timer went off and Tami relaxed. The great apparatus slowly creaked to a halt. Homer wheeled up. ‶Hi Homer,‶ Tami said, catching her breath, looking down at him past her widely spread lower lips, her soaked pubic hair.<br><br>‶You're looking good, Tami,‶ he said with a smile, then he wheeled off.<br><br>And now the great moment, at least great for the TL's. They were chatting at the base of the Beast, and Myra looked up and said in a stage whisper, ‶Tami, I could just lick you all over right now.‶<br><br>Tami smiled. ‶That . . . would be nice. I have to get going though.‶ The flexing toes, curled over the blades, indicated her horniness.<br><br>‶Too bad,‶ Myra said.<br><br>‶I'd like to lick you too,‶ Jeane said.<br><br>‶Me too,‶ Spica said.<br><br>From her perch, looking down, the sweating naked Queen said, ‶Then why don't we get together sometime?‶<br><br>The mouths of the TL's dropped open.<br><br>As Tami dismounted, jumping down with a soft thud, she said, ‶My place sometime. Rod will be there.‶<br><br>Now that was a letdown. Having this man around would disrupt all that female energy. Not that this could be expressed to Tami. For one thing, she was always too down-to-earth to believe that ‶female energy‶ stuff. And he was her husband, of course.<br><br>By the time they had meandered to the exit with her, though, they had reconciled themselves to it. Having Rod around at the Tami-thon would not be so bad. They didn't know him well but he seemed to be a nice guy. Maybe he could help out with the refreshments.<br><br>Their ruminations were interrupted by the clap of thunder.<br><br>‶Shit!!!‶ Spica said, looking out at the icy rainshower. ‶I left my umbrella in the dorm.‶<br><br>‶Me too,‶ Jeane said. They had their things in the locker room but it was just coats and boots, no umbrellas.<br><br>Tami seemed to look at them in sympathy. Then she said, ‶Well, gute nacht,‶ and opened the door and sprinted out into the cold rain, her feet slapping the slush to both sides. They saw her sleek, wet body pass under the lights and disappear into the darkness." },
      { title: "Chapter 18", content: "Albert Girardo, Chair of the Department of Fashion Technology, just could not find that damn cubbyhole. At least that was what everyone called them, the tiny rooms overlooking the multipurpose room in the Student Union where they had those dances and other big events. Every student tutor had one, and the one he was looking for was 2-07. But they only went up to 2-06 and then there was the fire exit. So he had to backtrack . . .<br><br>He hardly ever came here. All his work was in Thayer Hall right next to his special parking place. On this sunny, melting-snow day he had unwisely worn moccasins and his feet got a little wet coming down that unfamiliar concourse. He got his first real look at that statue Wanamaker spoke about: ‶Tami Takes Flight‶. A good piece of work, abstract but not too weird. That was his motto, a good rule to live by in his field, how he and his department fought for and won a measure of respectability during his fifteen years at its helm: Don't Be Too Weird.<br><br>So this little errand cut across his grain in so many ways. But with a student who lived without the benefit of clothing it was just no surprise that all the usual rules were reversed. That she was a salt-of-the-earth, working class type, so unusual in his field, made her all the more unforgettable. He vividly remembered the last time he was down this way. It was last spring, a warm day in May, flowers in bloom. They hadn't cut the grass yet and the lawn in front of the Union was a bit overgrown. He had been roped into one of those godawful Department Head get-togethers, spending all morning in the multipurpose room with the twelve most boring persons on the planet.<br><br>It was a relief to finally get out, around lunchtime. Clouds were overhead, possibly threatening rain, and the air was heavy with the scent of growing grass, a gentle warm breeze. He approached the lawn and saw people lined in front of it, maybe two dozen, most still well clothed as if it were still a chilly spring, some more appropriately in shirtsleeves. He ambled up to the edge in his lazy, old-man way, and stopped short when he saw what they were looking at.<br><br>It was Campbell-Frank's only naked student, sleeping in the lush uncut grass. Other free-spirited students had occasionally dozed off there, in the sun, but always on blankets after a little picnic. And always clothed.<br><br>She was on her side, upper leg extended in front of her, in blissful slumber. Grass stains were on her soles. Her butt cheeks were parted and everyone could see her anus — was it winking at them in the breeze? Now she turned, pulling her leg across, and in the process uprooting some grass. It stayed between her toes as if she had grabbed it deliberately and now she was on her back, her legs splayed wide open so that everyone could see inside her womanly cave. She stretched her arms up and her tummy became almost freakishly concave, ribs visible over the tracery of well-developed abs, breasts high and firm with erect nipples poking up at the gray sky. A few strands of grass were caught up in her lush pubic hair. And now she sighed. ‶Mmmmmmm . . .‶, as earthy and natural as the scented breeze.<br><br>It was a wave partly of lust but also of wonder that riffled through the watchers. And envy, how it must feel like to roll naked in the grass. Two of those old Chalfont Institute professors stood next to him, one puffing on his pipe. You could tell those old German guys anywhere. ‶I'm jealous now,‶ one said. The pipe puffer said, ‶Ah Fritz, if Youth only knew, if Age only could!‶<br><br>Girardo had stayed to watch her lolling around for a few minutes and then she awoke, sitting up with wild hair, elbows on her knees, smiling a little absently at the people around her as if remembering an old joke. Then he left, as the crowd dispersed, some saying hi to the naked girl, others as if embarrassed at having been caught looking. Girardo was gay through and through, but a sight like that sticks with you no matter who you are.<br><br>Now — this one's 2-01, now 2-03, this must be the odd numbers corridor finally —<br><br>Her door was open and he hesitated before making his presence known. She was facing away from him, leaning back on her chair, reading a text, pencil in her mouth. One foot was way, way up over her head, the heel propped up on the wall in the tiny room. Only a trained gymnast, like she was, could stretch like that. The other foot was up on the ledge of the little window that looked down on the multipurpose room. She held a pen between the third and fourth toes that she tapped idly against the sill. Girardo was reminded of the student who did that project on toe rings a few years ago, who said, ‶Toes are the new fingers.‶ Well for Ms. Smithers, it was all the same.<br><br>Her desk was strewn with books, papers, a laptop. And what looked like a wedding ring, though it seemed too small to go on her finger. There was a shelf above that had some pictures and some type of geometric sculptures with magnetic sticks.<br><br>Finally he cleared his throat.<br><br>‶Oh hi Mr. Girardo,‶ she said, quickly swiveling around, putting her book down, and about to stand up.<br><br>‶Stay seated, please,‶ he said, quite surprised. Years ago students would stand up when a professor came in, but not recently.<br><br>She sat obediently waiting for him to speak.<br><br>‶Um, how are you doing?‶<br><br>‶Fine, busy as always,‶ she said. ‶I like it that way.‶<br><br>He looked at the upper shelf. ‶Did you make this? It's very pretty.‶<br><br>‶It's a dodecahedron. One of the regular polyhedrons.‶<br><br>‶Oh. A dodeca . . .‶<br><br>‶That means twelve. It has twelve sides.‶<br><br>‶Hmm . . .Looks like more than twelve to me.‶<br><br>‶The sides are pentagons. You have to stellate them to make it rigid.‶<br><br>‶Oh right . . . of course.‶ He looked at it for a moment as if knowing what she was talking about. ‶Tami, mind if I sit?‶ He grabbed a chair that had been out in the hall and sat facing her. She was upright in her chair, hands folded attentively. Her feet were on the floor, curled inward, the pen still in her toes.<br><br>‶Dr. Wanamaker and I agree, your portfolio is outstanding.‶<br><br>She seemed to blush. ‶Thank you.‶<br><br>‶We have a proposal for you.‶ Knowing he was about to explain something totally new to her, he went slowly despite her high intelligence. ‶There is something called the International Fashion Industry Foundation. It's a group endowed by various fashion houses, that acts as like a trade group, a clearinghouse of information, and also advocates for designer and models and other tradespeople. And every year the foundation has a, uh, competition for students. This year is the 37th annual. We would like you to invite you to make a submission, enter the competition. In other words, sponsor you.‶<br><br>She seemed stunned. ‶But . . . I'm not a fashion major.‶<br><br>‶That's not important. What is, is that we think you display an extraordinary amount of originality. Maybe it's you're, uh, situation . . .‶ He found himself glancing down at her clit and immediately regretted the reference. Her clit was poking out a little — he heard it always did, except when she was out in the cold and it retracted between those plum-colored lips. He thought he detected a faint whiff of female musk. Then he brought his mind back on track. ‶But you have a view to fashion that is unique and should be made better known, and should be further developed if you wish . . . We don't just ask anyone. We don't do this every year. In fact we haven't sponsored a student in five years. So you see what a compliment this is meant to be.‶<br><br>‶Gosh . . . thanks . . .‶ She was still in shock.<br><br>‶You will need to put together a submission portfolio. You can select from your existing one — the limit is ten designs — or make up a new one. Probably selecting from the one you have is best, because the deadline is only in two weeks. Dr. Wanamaker will help you out with the details.‶<br><br>Tami looked down.<br><br>‶That's the first stage. Then they select the ten or twelve best entries and present a fashion show, slash, awards ceremony. I have to say that they have several hundred submissions every year, so the odds of getting picked for the show are slim. This year it's in Montreal. And then, there's the prizes. First prize is a fellowship with room and board at a leading institution. This year it's somewhere that you especially might have an interest in.‶<br><br>‶What do you mean?‶<br><br>‶The fellowship, which would begin next fall, is in your home town, at the Rhode Island School of Design.‶<br><br>Tami looked up, nonplussed. ‶Rizdy?‶ Which is how Providence natives refer to RISD.<br><br>Girardo nodded. ‶Again, I have to say, excellent as your work is, the odds of getting chosen are quite long. But even being allowed to submit is an honor. We get to put forth candidates because our department is on the International panel. Only about sixty schools around the world are on it.‶<br><br>Tami looked at him and then looked over at a pad on the desk. ‶I — I don't know what to say. This is so . . .‶<br><br>‶Now Tami, you don't have to go through with this. I know you are involved in other projects and fashion is not the center of your life.‶ God, was that ever an understatement, he told himself.<br><br>‶Well yes, I was working on that polymer fabric with Gretchen — ‶<br><br>‶Maybe you can incorporate that into your submission. Ever think of that?‶<br><br>‶The fabric — it's designed for military use.‶<br><br>‶So? Does that mean you CAN'T use it to design regular clothes? Look Tami, the International is not a red carpet type fashion show like you see on TV. These are serious industry people who help decide mass production. What regular people wear. Practical stuff.‶<br><br>He told himself: I'm dropping hints that are so heavy that they're apt to break this poor girl's [bare] toes. Best back off. She will submit what she wants to submit, as weird as it may be. That is, if she accepts. Part of him wanted her to refuse. That would be a relief. On the other hand, Shel was right. Offering her the chance was really the right thing to do.<br><br>‶Rizdy . . .But can I go there if I'm . . .‶ She looked down at her breasts, the big dark brown nipples, toughened and always erect.<br><br>Quite unlike the little pink nips Girardo had seen on countless anorexic models. What would Tami be — a 34C? He was under no illusions about it — gay designers really would rather be working with breastless young men. One of Wanamaker's pet peeves. He kidded Wanamaker about his name and his lusting after certain models, his hetero desire for the female form, his breast fetish, but his colleague had a point. To be true to what they were doing, designers of women's clothing should use models who look more like this superb naked young woman.<br><br>‶From what I understand,‶ he said, ‶your allergy is being treated at the Chalfont Institute.‶ At least that's what Abu Jamal told him when Girardo called him last week. It was hard to understand that guy's Pakistani accent. He was polite but hesitant to give details. Girardo was well aware how sensitive the topic was over at that place, and couldn't really blame him for that.<br><br>‶Well yes,‶ Tami said uncertainly. ‶. . . Can I think about this?‶<br><br>‶Of course. When you decide, call Shel, Dr. Wanamaker. His extension is 2141.‶ To his surprise Tami brought her left foot way up, the one with the pen, and scribbled the number on the pad, all without moving her arms or hands.<br><br>‶Well let us know,‶ he concluded. ‶And if you accept, congratulations.‶ He got up and turned to leave.<br><br>‶Mr. Girardo?‶<br><br>‶Yes?‶<br><br>‶I — I don't know. But thank you very much.‶<br><br>He smiled. ‶You deserve it, Tami. . . And oh, before I forget.‶ He turned back to her. ‶The submissions are not secret, of course. The names of candidates are listed in the trade publications. So you might be, in fact probably will be, getting calls and offers to market your designs. It's O.K. to get into contracts, we don't have any business telling our students what or what not to do.<br><br>‶But we always suggest that the student create a brand name and logo for his or her work, and attach it to every design. Get copyright protection. The way I learned it was to mail the designs to yourself and keep the envelope sealed. That fixes the date you came up with the ideas. And be careful what you sign. Professor Konrad, two doors down from me, he's also an intellectual property lawyer and can advise you on common pitfalls.<br><br>‶But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me repeat, no matter how good you are, the odds of actually winning are very low. But I think you should give it a shot.‶<br><br>Tami seemed about to say something but then stopped. She looked down and stretched her arms downward, then placed them on her lap. She idly tugged at her pubic hair.<br><br>Then she looked up and said politely, ‶Thank you. I'll let you know in a few days.‶<br><br>‶Good.‶ Girardo left the naked student to be alone with her thoughts. And then passed her cubbyhole a few seconds later because he was lost. Tami had to get up and walk him back to the elevator.<br><br>As the elevator opened, a tall Latina-looking girl in sweat clothes came out. She gave Tami a little kiss and went with her back to the cubbyhole where they closed the door behind them." }
