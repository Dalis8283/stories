      { title: "Hyacinth's Buddy", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "She kept crying, clutching the pillow in front of her and her drawn-up knees, as if the pillow were an article of clothing.  But she had no clothing, nor did the three roommates who sat around her on her bed.<br><br>It was the first rule of the college: at Blanke Schande, female students had to be naked at all times.  They weren't even allowed shoes.  She knew this from the beginning, of course, months ago when she ordered the catalog and then called for more info and, as naturally as if she had asked about the meal plan, was told the truth.  And immediately hung up, but then as the days went on . . . It titillated her sense of adventure, and as much as she fought it, made her horny.  Walking around naked in front of all those guys!  She knew the power a curvy body like hers had over men, she saw how they jumped at doing anything for her when she went around in her little tube top or her low-rise jeans with the thong sticking out.  Life was so goddamned boring where she grew up, in a suburb of San Diego, and as a smart 18-year-old girl with much artistic talent, she just felt more and more drawn to this little college where she could study art and indulge in a secret fantasy . . .<br><br>August was only a few weeks in the past, but how long ago it seemed now!  It was clear by now that she had signed up for a tour of Hell.  It would be one thing to give the guys a thrill and then run back to the room and put on clothes, but to be constantly naked every minute of every day, with no relief, naked in the bathroom, naked in class, naked in the dining hall, naked walking through the quad . . . and to have guys staring at you and staring at you and still looking even after you had gotten sick of being looked at and just wanted to run and hide --<br><br>But of course that was against the rules too.  No female was allowed to hide or even cover her breasts or pussy with her hands.  Worse, every female student was to show any part of her body on request to any male student -- what was known as ‶presenting‶.  Theoretically this included a request for a close-up look of a girl's elbow, but of course, the requests all involved spreading legs.  And then taking a good hard look, sometimes three or four guys at a time, at a girl's most intimate parts.  At such times Hyacinth shut her eyes and felt her face burn red with shame.  It was bad enough showing her pussy.  But when they asked her to spread her butt cheeks to see her butthole, that really freaked her out.  She had been told during orientation to clean herself extra well in the shower; now she knew why.<br><br>And it was always the dorkiest, most obnoxious guys who asked to ‶present‶.  Some girls like Janie weren't bothered by it at all, eagerly opening up her legs, even on the quad, while laughing as if to say, ‶Go ahead and look -- you'll never get to actually touch this in a million years!‶  Then there was Jacqueline, a junior majoring in Human Sexuality, who calmly and without shame showed everything as if patiently instructing medical students.  But to most girls, especially the freshmen, it was an ordeal.  Two of Hyacinth's roommates were freshmen too, and they had cringed each time, so shamed that they hadn't wanted to talk about it afterward.  For Hyacinth it was beyond cringing; it was traumatic.<br><br>Half an hour ago had been the last straw.  That fat frat guy had asked her to ‶present‶ in the student union, right on top of a table.  And then a few others joined him, leaning forward as she looked forlornly at the ceiling, the tabletop cold and gritty under her bare back -- then as she spread open her pussy lips she could feel their breath down there and one of the guys erupted with a gutteral laugh --<br><br>She had jumped up, pushed her way through the guys, and tearfully ran back to the dorm, bare feet slapping up the stairs, and buried herself under her pillow.  She wailed and wailed, bringing the attention of the others.<br><br>Not an uncommon sound in the freshman dorms, a girl freaking out over her new life of permanent nakedness.  To help the female freshmen adjust, each was assigned to an upperclassman ‶Buddy‶.  Hyacinth's Buddy was Jessie, a junior with big glasses, red hair, and a very slim, white-skinned frame.  Now, watching the naked suffering girl, Jessie looked at her with sympathetic eyes.  This was Jessie's first freshman freak-out, and she concentrated on all she had learned during that training course.<br><br>The sobbing girl sniffled and shook her head, her messed up blond hair stiff with dried tears.  ‶I'm -- not going out there again.  Not w - without clothes.‶  She looked up at the empty closets, doors open.  It seemed cruel to have closets in this place because no girl had any clothes to put in them.  The washing machines downstairs were a waste too.  And that was not the end of their lack of privacy.  This suite was just four beds in one big room along with desks and computers, a kitchenette, and a bathroom with no door and an open shower.<br><br>Jessie reached out to hold Hyacinth's hand.  ‶I know it's hard,‶ she said.<br><br>‶It's not hard, it's im - POSSible,‶ she said, grabbing Jessie's hand but punching the other one down onto the mattress.  Then they could see her clench her butt and she closed her eyes.  ‶Clothes, please God, I want clothes, something to put on.‶  She looked down at her bare feet.  ‶And shoes.  And socks.  Please, I want to be covered up again.‶<br><br>‶You have to hold on,‶ Ruth, one of the freshman roommates, said.  ‶You have to stick it out.‶  Not that all did; one reason Blanke Schande admitted four women for every man was that almost half the women dropped out during the first semester.  Hyacinth had heard the testimonials of graduates, and had read that the women who graduated from Blanke Schande enjoyed phenomenal success once back in the ‶real world‶ of clothes.  But graduation seemed impossibly far away.  Right now, all Hyacinth felt was shame and panic.  She clutched the pillow more tightly, technically an improper covering up but something which Jessie had discretion to overlook.<br><br>‶I c - can't do -- that again,‶ she said.  ‶Especially not my -- my butt.‶<br><br>‶Yes, Hy, it was crude,‶ Jessie said.  ‶I heard about it.  The man is supposed to be polite when he asks you to present.‶<br><br>‶I don't care about crude or polite anymore,‶ Hyacinth said, becoming a little more calm.  ‶I want out.‶<br><br>Her choice, Jessie knew.  Yet what an opportunity she would be missing by dropping out!  It was like any homesickness by a freshman the first couple of weeks away, you had to acknowledge the feeling but urge that she stay.  Jessie had an idea.  ‶Why don't we work on it.‶<br><br>‶She said she wanted out,‶ said Kristin, the other roommate.<br><br>Jessie gave Kristin a stern look.  ‶That's her choice, but right now she's so upset.‶  Then looked at Hyacinth again.  ‶I have an idea.  Why don't we -- ‶  Wait, too fast.  ‶Why don't we have some salad and juice?  And chicken soup.  Definitely chicken soup.‶  Lunch, something normal.<br><br>While the sobbing girl stayed on her bed the other three padded around the kitchenette and set things up.  In a minute Hyacinth had been coaxed up and the four of them sat and ate around the table, feeling their bare butt cheeks against the cold metal folding chairs, their bare toes absently curling around the chair legs.  The food was good even though it was all low-calorie; with the steady diet of low-fat food, combined with the many exercise/sports classes the female students were required to attend, the nude quartet were in the best physical shape each of them had ever been in.  Even Hyacinth would have to concede that.<br><br>‶My idea,‶ Jessie said, ‶is for us to help you present.  I'll -- I'll do it first.  On the table.‶  At the sight of eyes rolling, Jessie said firmly, ‶I mean it!‶<br><br>Things were cleared away and Ruth was assigned to be the ‶guy‶.  She stood up and looked at Jessie sitting across from her.  They all knew this was a little hokey.  Ruth smiled and in a low grunty voice said, ‶All right, bitch!‶<br><br>Some giggling.  ‶No come on, really,‶ Jessie said.  No guy would get away with that.<br><br>Ruth took a deep breath, her bare tanned breasts rising and falling.  Then she opened her eyes, getting into the mood.  ‶I would like you to present for me, please.‶<br><br>Jessie slowly and carefully got up onto the table, her toes brushing past the other two girls right and left, and sat cross-legged, looking up obediently at Ruth.  Then she leaned back on her hands and spread her legs, each bare foot sticking out in the room, giving a clear view of her pussy, slightly opened.  ‶Is this how you want it?‶<br><br>‶No,‶ Ruth said, using words she had heard several times.  ‶Please turn over.  And spread your butt cheeks so I can see all of you.‶<br><br>Jessie, wanting to imitate the average freshman's shame, bit her lip slightly and then slowly turned over.  She put her face onto the table top, reached back and spread her lower cheeks.  As she looked past Hyacinth she gulped and stared at the far wall in a convincing portrayal of mortification.<br><br>‶Spread more.  You have a very cute butthole.‶  Ruth leaned forward, exhaling into Jessie's lower crevice.  Jessie pulled her hands apart more, stretching her wide rear valley with the coffee-colored orifice in the center.<br><br>Ruth felt that this was enough.  ‶Okay?‶ she asked Jessie in a stage whisper.<br><br>‶Yes.‶<br><br>‶Thank you,‶ Ruth said, the usual signal that presenting was over.  Jessie turned around and sat back up on the table top cross-legged.  ‶You want to try it, Hy?‶<br><br>Hyacinth looked down at her breasts and crossed her arms over them.  ‶We did this same thing during class,‶ she said, referring to the compulsory Anatomy and Movement (‶erotocize‶) classes that all female students had to attend.  ‶It's just different doing it for a -- a guy.‶<br><br>A knock on the door.  ‶Come in!‶  It was a girl Hyacinth had never seen before, a tall, lithe, deeply tanned girl with sharp features and long black hair.  She looked like an athlete.<br><br>‶Hi Wen,‶ Jessie said.  ‶Thanks.‶  The tall girl was returning a book.  ‶You know Wendy, from Alturas?‶<br><br>No, and as Wendy bent down the three at the table gave her the typical greeting Blanke Schande women gave to each other, a kiss on the lips.  No one knew how that custom started.<br><br>Hyacinth breathed in, which resulted in a loud sniffle that showed she had been crying.  ‶We've had a situation here,‶ Jessie said.<br><br>‶Bummer.‶  Wendy looked down at Hyacinth.  Hyacinth had heard about Alturas, that satellite campus way up north in the mountains, where it snowed five months out of the year.  Yet female students had to be naked up there too.  How did they stand it?  She had heard that they learned to endure being outside in the cold for quite long periods, but she couldn't help but believe that in such a climate naked women were helpless creatures who were reduced to scurrying between buildings as fast as they could.  Yet Wendy looked anything but helpless.  She looked strong enough to pick up all those creeps who had asked her to present and throw them halfway across the quad.<br><br>‶Wendy's on the rock climbing team,‶ Jessie said.  Then, to Wendy, ‶Hy's had a very bad presenting experience.  Perfectly legal but they were creepy about it.‶<br><br>Rugged as she was, Wendy's face softened.  ‶I really hear you.  I almost dropped out my first semester.  I just couldn't take it.‶  She and Hyacinth looked at each other for a moment.  Then Wendy walked around and bent down to place her arms around Hyacinth's neck, her face next to the stricken girl's.  ‶Think of us, all of us.  You have every other Blanke Schande woman to support you.‶<br><br>Hyacinth, feeling tears coming again, got up and turned to give Wendy a full-body hug.  And now the scraping of chairs as the others got up too, forming a great big hug of bare female flesh with Hyacinth at the center.  It felt so good, the warmth of another woman's naked skin against yours.  Below, bare toes slowly rubbed against each other.  Though none of the roommates had any lesbian tendencies, they enjoyed lying against each other on the same bed while watching TV or just talking or relaxing, skin against skin, as if the others' bare bodies were the only clothing they were allowed.<br><br>A clearing of the throat and Wendy disengaged herself.  It was a guy with a pleasant face and wild black hair, dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans, and hiking boots.  Not only his gender but his clothes set him apart, made him an alien being in this lair of naked females.<br><br>‶Hank, you got finished?‶ Wendy said.<br><br>‶Yeah.  I'm done with the registrar.  We can go back north.  Not,‶ he said, blushing, ‶like I'm in a hurry.  I can come back later.‶<br><br>‶No -- wait.  This is my boyfriend,‶ Wendy said, going over to him and kissing him on the cheek.  He lazily put his arm around her, his hand curling around her hip bone.  ‶He's also -- really something.‶  She playfully bit his ear and grabbed his crotch.<br><br>‶Ow,‶ he said.  ‶Careful, I'm still sore.‶ <br><br>‶You two must pork each other a lot,‶ Jessie said, deliberately being playfully crude, feeling herself on the same wavelength as Wendy.  The best thing right now for Hyacinth, seeing a man who was civilized and friendly.<br><br>‶This lady will kill me,‶ Hank said.  ‶Four times a day.  And my tongue is alwayth thore,‶ he said with a lisp, causing Kristin to giggle.<br><br>‶I love cock climbing, I mean rock climbing,‶ Wendy joked.<br><br>‶How can you -- live up there where it's cold?‶ Hyacinth said.  ‶And I don't see how you can rock climb with bare feet.  My feet are‶ -- she looked down -- ‶always chewed up just from the cobblestones.‶<br><br>Wendy, keeping her contact with Hank, stretched her foot out and put it on the table.  ‶You just need some more conditioning.  I can walk on anything by now.  Go ahead, feel it.‶<br><br>Hyacinth hesitated but then felt Wendy's sole with her thumb.  It was thick and tough, almost like the pads on dog's foot.  Wendy spread her toes and Hyacinth saw that they were tough too.<br><br>After a moment of saying nothing, Wendy looked at Hyacinth and said, ‶Why don't we get Hank to ask you to present.  As practice.‶<br><br>‶Just what I was thinking,‶ Jessie said.<br><br>Hank was so likeable and nonthreatening that after a moment of thinking Hyacinth couldn't help but agree.  ‶How about a voluntary presenting,‶ Jessie said.  It was an exercise they had done in the erotocize class.  By now Hyacinth knew the drill.  But in front of a guy!<br><br>Hyacinth went ahead gamely.  She was in the middle of friends and just couldn't let them down.  Up on the table she went, on her back, as Hank took his place in front of her.  The others gathered around as if they were other guys, though their nakedness rather upset that illusion.<br><br>Heels up against her butt, the girl spread her legs slowly and forced herself to look right at Hank.  She had memorized the words.  ‶Th - this is my vagina,‶ she said, placing her hands on the inside of her thighs to frame it.  She closed her eyes and took a breath to gather her strength.  Now, she opened her legs further and reached down to open up her lower lips.  ‶Go ahead, look inside me.‶  Hank, after a quick glance at Wendy, decided to get into the role and leaned forward, even saying, ‶Open up more, please.‶<br><br>Hyacinth pushed forward and up so that her pussy was almost in Hank's face.  She stretched her pussy lips apart more and did that thing with her stomach muscles from the class.  ‶C - can you see up in there?‶  Hank nodded.<br><br>‶This is my clitoris,‶ Hyacinth said, stretching up the top of her pussy and delicately grabbing the little fleshy structure and pulling it out.  She had never done that before taking those classes, in fact she probably wouldn't have known how.  But like all the female students she had become intimately familiar, through the use of mirrors and looking up into each other during the classes, with each little part of her lower regions.  She tugged on the little clit a couple of times, and the flush in her cheeks and the short quickening of breath were not things she could control.  Hank had two sensations, one of wanting to take over and lick her pussy, the other a twang of pain in his tongue from remembering his labors in trying to satisfy his girlfriend, who liked to be licked several times a day, often in public or near-public locations.<br><br>Hyacinth stretched out the clit to a maximum.  ‶Is this O.K.?‶ she said with a little gasp.  Hank nodded.  Now was when Hyacinth really hesitated.  Now was the icky part.  She froze.<br><br>‶Go ahead,‶ Jessie prodded.<br><br>Slowly Hyacinth got up and turned over on all fours, a quick and graceful motion that had been taught and practiced in class.  ‶Voluntary Presenting‶ and all its motions were looked on as a necessary part of any Blanke Schande female's education, though nobody ever did it in ‶real life‶, presenting themselves only upon request, and maybe only Jacqueline Leontieff ever presented using the exact V.P. protocol.<br><br>Hyacinth's face burned as she stuck her butt up toward Hank.  Now her hands nervously grasped each cheek and began to pull.  Bad memories were coming thick and fast now but she consciously tried to suppress them.  She knew her anal area was clean -- every girl was sure to clean there thoroughly in the shower, and before going out to meet a guy every girl was sure to show her private parts to her roommate to ask ‶Am I all clean down there?‶ -- but it was still horrid to display her most disgusting, private region to a guy.  It was so unfair.  Guys could wear clothes all the time, and not only did the girls have to be naked, they had to show all they had, every inch, every hole!<br><br>The sound of Hank's throat clearing reminded her that his was a friendly presence, which made it not too bad.  She continued with practiced words.  ‶This is my anus.‶  She spread her cheeks apart more and then, most difficult of all, turned her head around to look her observer in the eye.  ‶Go ahead, you can look closer.  My anus is always very clean.‶<br><br>Hank looked at Hyacinth and Hyacinth looked at Hank from poles apart.  The girl's eyes only partly hid the bottomless well of shame she was experiencing.  This was the worst thing for any Blanke Schande female, the eye contact during anal presentment.  In a tiny voice she said, ‶Is this O.K.?‶<br><br>Hank smiled.  ‶Yes, thank you.‶<br><br>Hyacinth released her butt cheeks and brought her hands forward to cover her face.  ‶Oh God,‶ she said, half in relief, half in tears.  But now with an increasing feeling of satisfaction at having passed a difficult test.  ‶Good job Hy!‶ Jessie said as the nude females gathered around and took turns kissing the teary face.  Getting her energy back, Hyacinth sat up and found herself in the middle of another group hug of female skin, interrupted now by the intrusion of scraping clothes and a hug from Hank.<br><br>.   .   .   .<br><br>It was breezy and a little chilly, at least by Southern California standards, when the four roommates gathered together at the benches outside the Student Union after dinner, snacking on chips.  A crowded place this time of day, gaggles of clothed males and naked females sitting at tables mostly with each other, though there were several ‶integrated‶ tables at which clothed and naked sat together.<br><br>And now Wendy and Hank, hand in hand.  Hyacinth braced herself.  The planned moment had arrived.  Hank, still holding Wendy's hand, walked over to Hyacinth and said, ‶Excuse me, you are very pretty.‶<br><br>‶Thank you.‶ she replied, feeling the blush on her breasts, her nipples stiff in the chilly air.<br><br>After a measured moment, Hank said, ‶Please present to me.‶<br><br>It wasn't the protocol, Hyacinth didn't describe her attributes, but the smooth concrete of the table felt rather nice on her bare back as she got up and spread her legs.  Guys gathered around, no doubt having heard about this freshman girl's earlier freakout and wondering what would happen this time.  She braved the stares, opened her pussy, fished out her clit and tugged on it.  And now she flipped over.<br><br>She could feel every tiny breeze on her sphincter, every face on campus seemed to be looking at her as she turned and faced her observer.  And there was her psychology professor, puffing on his pipe.  And God knows who else.  But then she looked over at Wendy, the rugged naked rock climber, who had to present too when asked, and yet was strong and confident and seemed like she could conquer anything.  Maybe some of that rubbed off on Hyacinth just then.  She was certainly feeling shame.  But there was also the feeling that just maybe, she would be able to survive the rigors of Blanke Schande College after all." },
      { title: "Hyacinth in the Mountains", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "‶Hi roomie!‶  Sarah's big tanned boobs almost filled the driver's window, her erect brown nipples practically sticking Jessie in the face and seeming to bounce halfway to Hyacinth, who was curled up in the passenger seat of Jessie's little Taurus.  The shy freshman, who had been half-slid down to the floor out of sight with her arms across her breasts, decided she should get with the Blanke Schande College program now that they were on a BSC campus, and slowly sat up, with a great effort putting her hands to her sides and even bravely squaring her shoulders.  Showing modesty was against the rules, though Jessie, her assigned ‶Buddy‶ and suite-mate, was very forgiving of Hyacinth's struggles to overcome her shyness, a shyness she never knew she had until she signed up for this crazy college where female students had to be naked at all times.<br><br>Crazy, but it worked.  This was a real college with real courses, professors, grades, lectures, though looking around in one of the lecture halls at all the clothed guys interspersed with the naked girls, hair draped over bare shoulders, breasts jiggling almost imperceptibly on their chests as they took notes, here and there bare feet splayed up on the seats in front, even their pussies in full view under their notebooks and laptops -- Hyacinth felt like she was in a dream, some alternate universe invented by a horny guy in which the girls were just eye candy without any thought to how they must feel if they had to be naked 24/7.<br><br>Yet the girls were happy, or at least most of them; the ones who couldn't take the nudity, and who went crying to the counselor's office with their hands over their breasts and crotch, had dropped out during those first rough weeks.  Now in mid-October it seemed that Hyacinth, at least, might make it through.  She still longed for clothes, and kept torturing herself by going to that corner of the library where the girls congregated to read romantic novels of women dressed in lavish finery.  Most of all she hated ‶presenting‶ on request to any guy who asked.  But all the other girls were naked too and were in the same boat.  Plus, she always had her suite-mates to run to and to hang out with, especially Jessie, who was like a big sister.  She loved hanging out at night in the suite watching TV with them, all lying together on Jessie's bed, a tangle of legs against arms against boobs against butts, feeling the bare female skin all around her.  Though none of the four girls had any lesbian tendencies, the feeling was just heavenly, better than the fluffiest blanket.  The girls were together in nakedness, a powerful bond forged between all the BSC women which enabled them to go on.<br><br>So even though she never met Sarah before, she recognized the extra twinkle in the brown eyes of the big-boobed girl as she smiled at her.  Hyacinth couldn't help but smile back as she straightened up further.  Making any motion to cover oneself was against the rules, but Jessie hadn't said anything while Hyacinth had cowered during that drive through town, this little cowboy town way up in the corner of the state, after that long, long ride up from the balmy beachfront world of the main BSC campus.  And of course Sarah wouldn't report anything either.<br><br>‶Hi, Hy!‶ Sarah said, that little joke that Hyacinth had always been used to.  ‶My old roomie tells me you're into the program, kind of.‶  She extended her hand, her boobs hanging over Jessie's lap.  Jessie grabbed them as if they were grapefruit that she was considering buying.  ‶I think you're getting bigger,‶ she said.<br><br>‶It's the mountain air, it makes everything grow,‶ she said, clasping Hy's hand, as if oblivious to her breasts being squeezed at the same time, an attitude which was yet another thing that the new girl was having a hard time getting used to.  Then she said something even stranger.  ‶In chem lab the guys ask to weigh them before class on that little sliding scale.  I'm up to left tit 1.3 kilos, right tit 1.2.‶<br><br>They were just outside the admissions building on the edge of this little campus.  This was after driving along a winding road through a redwood forest, passing the occasional guy and (naked) girl walking up or down.  Two guys now passed by, openly gawking at the scene, as Sarah, to keep her balance, stuck her foot out behind her and her toes almost brushed against one of the guys' backpacks.  Jessie and Sarah seemed to pretend the guys weren't there.  Hyacinth was glad it wasn't her breasts that were being grabbed and discussed!<br><br>‶Can I get a lift?‶  And then Jessie giggled as Sarah hopped onto the hood of the car.  And turned around on all fours and kept talking.  Hyacinth sat there open-mouthed as the car cruised up through a rustic little village of classroom buildings made up in log-cabin style.  And then there was the dining hall.  Students walking around, and older types who must have been professors.  And all the female students naked. . .  Was it some kind of admissions policy, or the constant exercise and ‶erotocize‶ classes, but why was every female so beautiful in both face and figure?  Or maybe it was something else, something in the mind . . .<br><br>Hyacinth had finally gotten used to this type of scene at the main BSC campus, but to see it played out in a new setting it was like this was some kind of alternate universe that she had entered through a different door.  She had heard the campus was expanding, and sure enough there was a dug out pit and some workmen -- and a naked girl, covered with dust -- carrying stuff in and out.<br><br>Jessie, the most sober and sensible of all the BSC females, was bemused as Sarah, a ‶wild woman‶, proceeded to live up to that reputation.  ‶The guys' dorm is to the right, the girls are on the left, it's smaller of course, no closets . . . You're really going to like going up the mountain with Wendy Mac and Hank, they're so cool, Wendy's a real superwoman, don't mind the others, they're O.K., too bad you can't go Jess . . .‶  And all this time as she spoke through the windshield, her big boobs bounced crazily here and there as the car trundled slowly over the rocky path.  Many of the guys, especially, stopped to look and Hyacinth thought of the sight being presented to them: the butt of a naked girl coming at them on top of a car.  ‶Presented‶ indeed.  Sarah was showing her pussy and butthole, ‶presenting‶, to the whole campus.  As for Jessie, she could only smile and try to keep an eye on where she was driving.<br><br>.    .    .    .<br><br>Maybe it was the crisp, sun-filled mountain air that filled her lungs and made her feel so alive and sights so vivid.  Or the soft scented carpet of pine needles that felt so good beneath her feet after stepping on all those stones.  But Hyacinth just couldn't help smiling as she looked up at Wendy Macalester -- or ‶Mac‶, as the girls called her -- dancing up the high vertical rock face on the single rope.<br><br>Hank was standing next to her in his big hiking boots and climbing outfit, holding a coiled rope and various climbing implements, and he was smiling too as he watched his girlfriend, naked and unadorned with any equipment, prance up away from them.  ‶Beautiful, isn't she?‶ he said, clearly in love, and in a way so was Hyacinth, admiring the skillful and strong girl as she bounced off the rocks, her toes grabbing an outcropping here, then splaying the other leg to grab another outcropping there, as if she were upright and dancing happily on moon in one-sixth gravity.  The muscles of her tanned shoulders and butt worked quickly and gracefully, moving deceptively fast and pretty soon she was up, up, way up onto the top of the cliff, then she disappeared.  A moment later, having undone the grappling hook and tied the rope securely so as to take all of their weight, she reappeared, on hands and knees so all they saw was her head and her taut, brown breasts.  Her yell of ‶come up!‶ pierced easily through the quiet clean air.<br><br>Scott, Ahmad and Tommy came up behind and now all eyes turned to Hyacinth.  ‶You first, Hy,‶ Scott said, maybe too eagerly.  ‶That way we can spot you.‶  Hyacinth's face burned with shame.  Yeah, right.  And also look up at my crotch.  Scott wasn't really a bad guy, but was a pimply gawking type who was doofy and mostly likely a virgin, probably quite an accomplishment here at Alturas where, it was joked, the girls had a reputation for being horny all the time and wearing the guys out.<br><br>Hyacinth felt Scott's breathing on her breasts as he helped Hyacinth into her belt and cinched it tight around her thin waist.  And then up she went.  She had never scaled a rock face before, but it turned out not to be so hard.  She was used to climbing ropes in her daily body conditioning course, and this was much easier, with part of her weight on her feet.  Her soles weren't as tough as Mac's but it didn't hurt at all as she went from one rock to the next.  She knew she was being looked at by the guys who were following below.  Fortunately when climbing rocks, she was told, looking down is not a good idea.<br><br>When she got to the top it was just her and Mac, naked women on top of the cliff and maybe on top of the world.  She felt the moment lost when Scott lumbered up and stood behind them.  Ahmad, originally from Syria, came up next, a shy guy.  Then Hank, who went to stand over next to his girlfriend.  And finally Tommy Chen, exhuberant as always, saying, ‶I love this place. . . Where now, Four O'Clock?‶<br><br>‶Four O'Clock‶ . . . she had heard some of the guys call Mac that.  Odd nickname.  The tanned athlete, pretty tall anyway but standing higher than the rest on a rock, pointed to a steep, rocky rise that ended with a grove of pines on top.  And off they went.<br><br>It was pretty rugged hiking, and then it turned into climbing  -- ‶bouldering‶ -- as they scaled from one rock to the next.  The girls, not carrying any equipment, just their naked selves, climbed crablike on spread arms and legs and found it easier going than the guys, pulling away ahead until Tommy complained.  ‶This isn't exactly fair, you know.‶  Which was a good point, so Mac and Hyacinth each strapped a backpack on, one strap just under their breasts and the other across their taut midriffs, leaving the guys with just carrying the ropes and climbing gear.<br><br>Hyacinth grunted as she hefted herself up onto another rock.  This backpack was heavy, though in her improved physical condition it was no big deal.  Up ahead of her Mac seemed impeded not at all.  And with the benefit of toes to grab with and no clothes to hinder them the girls seemed to be at an advantage.  Except for the shame, that is.  As Hyacinth spread her foot out to grab another rock, then spread the other foot the other way to grab another, she was blushingly aware of her pussy opening slightly and the air hitting her inside and also her butthole.  She knew Scott was staring right up inside her.  And looking at her anus!  She just never could get used to the idea, of her most private place being constantly on display in public, always looked at.<br><br>As she hefted up again she looked up at Mac, whose crotch was equally widely spread.  Even Mac's pussy lips looked strong, somehow.  And her butthole.  Mac paused for a moment unexpectedly and Hyacinth found herself right under her.  She couldn't help but look, in a kind of morbid fascination, curious as to what guys would look at.  Mac had a little birthmark just above the wrinkled little asterisk, and another a little off to the right and down.  Four O'Clock!<br><br>The shaming ordeal ended with all six BSC students up on the high land, looking into a grove of trees.  Mac knew the way and the rest followed wordlessly.  Hyacinth felt the hotness in her face but the blushing went to the back of her mind as she took in their surroundings.  The sun was hot on her shoulders and the soft wind was bracing as it brushed her nipples and filled her nostrils, sticks warmed by the sun cracking underneath her bare feet.  To the side, she saw the land fall off and a great vista of crags and hills that went on for miles, in the far distance the great grey figure of an immense mountain.  She had always thought the ocean and beach were beautiful, but this!  She had an odd urge to stand there and raise her arms out and pray, thanking God -- maybe thanking ‶Gaea‶, that Earth Mother Goddess a lot of the BSC females had gotten interested in -- for such beauty.  Maybe she would have done that if she was alone, but then she heard the guys' big hiking boots behind her.  Maybe another time.<br><br>.     .     .     .<br><br>Hyacinth carefully nibbled at the burnt marshmallow, then got her mouth around it and gulped it down, leaving just a gloopy white trace on the stick, and leaned against Wendy Mac for warmth and carefully put her dusty feet a little closer to the fire.  She looked at the big tent appreciatively, looking forward to burrowing into one of those sleeping bags they'd brought.  It was chilly already, even though sunset was still maybe an hour away.  An occasional wind kicked up and stiffened her nipples and raised goosebumps.  Of course, they had ended with marshmallows.  Hyacinth loved the smell of wood smoke and she looked at the grill where they had cooked ears of corn and hot dogs.  If only she had clothes.  Being naked she felt so vulnerable out in the elements like this.<br><br>On the other side of Mac was Hank, trying to negotiate a triple marshmallow that he had overcooked and was threatening to fall off the stick.  As he did this Mac's toes caressed his hiking boot.  These two were always showing some kind of affection.  Hyacinth was jealous.  She hadn't had a boyfriend since high school and though there were some fine guys at BSC, she couldn't imagine getting together with someone, with her being naked all the time.  It was almost like trying to run a race when you were already at the finish line, the guy already knew everything about you, at least on the outside.<br><br>‶Let's go for a walk,‶ Mac said, grabbing Hyacinth by the hand.  The others looked on as the girls got up and walked over a little hill and out of sight.<br><br>It was then that Hyacinth said, ‶It's too cold.  Let's go in the tent.‶<br><br>‶Nonsense.  Just keep moving, you stay warm that way.‶  That's what the Alturas women always said when they were asked about it at the BSC main campus, it had become a cliche.  So, hugging her hands, watching where she put her feet, Hyacinth tried to keep up with Mac, who seemed to know no other walking speed except fast.<br><br>Mac angled this way and that through a stand of trees and then went through a clearing and then into another stand and then another clearing, with Hyacinth trying to keep up.<br><br>It was a little circle of trees, almost perfectly round as if planted that way.  And tall thick shrubs.  When Mac came to them she turned and waited.  Hyacinth felt the late sun on her body and she was warmed by the fast walking, her arms now dropped to her sides as she came up.  Mac took her by the hand and they made their way between two of the shrubs, feeling them scratch against their breasts and thighs.<br><br>They were in the middle of a circle of stones with a big flat stone in the middle.  Out of the sun, the stones were cold against their bare feet.  In fact it was impossible to see out of this place, the shrubs were so thick all around them.  Above, the trees formed a circular canopy, the only place they could see out was directly above at the deep blue sky, amazingly dark blue even though it was still daytime.<br><br>Mac held Hyacinth's hand as they both stood on the round flat stone.  ‶Welcome to Tami's Clothes.‶<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶That's what they call this place, Tami's Clothes.  I know, it's like too weird.  Nice though, right?‶<br><br>Hyacinth looked around.  ‶It's like a . . . like a church.  No, more like a . . .‶<br><br>Mac shrugged.  ‶I'm not exactly spiritual, but there is something about this place.‶<br><br>‶It's like . . . no one can see us.‶  She and Mac looked at each other.  They both laughed as she said it, thinking the same thing.  ‶Like this is our clothes!‶<br><br>They calmed down and stood there, hand in hand, for a long time silently.<br><br>‶Who made this place?  It can't be just . . . natural.‶<br><br>Mac spoke slowly.  ‶It's just a story, but supposedly there was this girl named Tami who had to go to college naked all the time.  I don't think it was Blanke Schande, some other place.  Except she didn't sign up for it like we did, they forced her to do it, she didn't want to be naked.  I don't know how that could happen, but when she got older she created this place so that any girl who had to be naked could come here where she would be covered and no one could see her body.‶<br><br>Hyacinth smiled.  ‶You're right, that is just too weird. . . But it is nice to be here.  Even if there were guys right out there they couldn't see us.‶  She looked up at her athletic friend.  ‶I'm not like you, I go through every day wishing I could have clothes.‶<br><br>‶No, I want clothes too.‶  The two looked at each other.  ‶That's right.  I think any woman is like that, any normal one.  Every day I fight the urge to grab the shirt off the next guy who passes by and put it on.‶  She was quiet for a moment.  ‶Don't tell Hank that, O.K.?‶<br><br>Hyacinth thought for a moment and ventured a guess.  ‶Fighting that urge is what makes you strong.‶<br><br>Mac looked down at their bare feet, then looked at Hyacinth's pussy.  ‶I didn't mean to tell you that.  That's another thing they say about this place.  It makes you always tell the truth.‶<br><br>Hyacinth hesitated for a moment, but it really seemed like the right thing to do.  She drew Mac toward her and gave her a full body hug, skin against skin, warmth against the increasingly chilly air.  They stood there for a while.<br><br>Mac stood apart, still holding Hyacinth's hand.  ‶Time for the little ritual.  You should be initiated.  Go like this.‶<br><br>Hyacinth, curious, watched as Mac stood straight up, face to the sky, arms stretched out and up.  ‶Please God, give me clothes.‶<br><br>Mac's eyes were closed as she kept looking up.  In another setting Hyacinth would have thought this ridiculous and stupid, but not here.  She took the cue, arms out, face up.  ‶Please God, give me clothes.‶<br><br>Mac continued.  ‶Please God, make the earth and sky my clothes.‶<br><br>‶Please God, make the earth and sky my clothes.‶<br><br>‶It is the prettiest dress I ever wore.‶<br><br>Hyacinth felt strange saying this.  ‶It is the prettiest dress I ever wore.‶<br><br>‶Thank you God.  Amen.‶<br><br>‶Thank you God.  Amen.‶<br><br>Mac put her arms down and took Hyacinth's hand again.  ‶Corny, right?  Some women like to say ‘Gaea' instead of ‘God', but that would be just too much for me.‶<br><br>Hyacinth smiled.  ‶I agree.‶<br><br>‶Let's go.  Gotta keep warm.‶  And Mac jogged off, shooting through the shrubs.  Hyacinth followed her, braving the scraping branches, and they ran back to camp.  Hyacinth glanced back at the little grove.  Such a silly little initiation, and yet the more she thought about it, she had to concede being pulled back there . . .  Now she turned around and huffed mightily and the two naked girls laughed as they turned the trip back into a race.<br><br>.     .     .<br><br>It gets dark quickly in the mountains after the sun goes down.  By the time the two naked BSC women got back to the camp site it was also getting seriously cold.  Hyacinth was glad to see the tent flap open, with pairs of hiking boots set outside.  Inside there was a little electric lamp and warmth.  And, of course, the guys.<br><br>This was a pretty big tent, big enough to hold all of them easily.  Yet as Hyacinth took her place sitting cross-legged next to Mac she was intensely aware of the close quarters and the intense stares by Ahmad, Scott and Tommy on her breasts and her pubic hair, clearly visible.  She longed to cover herself but that was against the rules.  As for Hank, he was laid back as always, holding Mac's hand as they all sat in a circle.<br><br>‶How do you like it up here?  Rugged, you say?‶ Ahmad said.<br><br>Hyacinth smiled and blushed.  He was being polite but still staring at her.  She couldn't help but notice the large bulge in his pants and dreaded the prospect of it getting stiffer and more obvious.  ‶Cold,‶ she said.  ‶But beautiful.‶<br><br>‶Not half as beautiful as you are,‶ Tommy said.  The new girl found herself blushing again.  What a sweet thing to say!  Yet also an open acknowledgement of her nudity.  ‶Thanks.‶<br><br>Now an ominous clearing of the throat.  And now Scott said, ‶I'd like you to present for me, please.‶  He cleared the space in the middle of the tent.<br><br>Hyacinth's heart froze for a second, but then she saw that he was looking at Mac, sitting tall and tanned and strong and so invincible looking.  With a poker face Mac shifted over to the middle of the circle, then lay back and spread her legs.  Each bare foot extended to the edges of the tent in between Hank and Tommy on one side and Ahmad and Hyacinth on the other.  Then she lifted her pelvis seemingly right up into Scott's face.<br><br>Scott bit his lip and was entranced.  Mac looked up at him but he kept his eyes fastened on her slightly opened pussy lips.  After a long moment he said, ‶Thank you.‶<br><br>But Mac didn't close up; she increased her exposure, bringing her hands around and spreading her lower lips further with her fingers.  Now Scott was faced with a wide open vagina, a hole gaping open at him that he fervently longed to put his penis into.  Mac undulated her hips and pushed herself even further into Scott's face, only a foot away now.  A faint scent of female whiffed through the tent, and all four penises responded to this natural signal within the cramped quarters of their respective pants.  ‶N - no, that's enough, th-thank you,‶ Scott stuttered.<br><br>‶Have some mercy, Four O'Clock,‶ Tommy said, only half-jokingly.  And with a little smile Mac brought her hips down and retreated cross-legged to where she was sitting before.<br><br>This scene puzzled Hyacinth.  She was still puzzling when Ahmad said, ‶I would very much like for you to present to me.  Your face is beautiful and I am sure the rest of you is too.‶  Hyacinth steeled herself.  She knew this moment was bound to come.  With a little glance at Mac, who gave her a reassuring look, she scooted over to the middle and was ready to lie back when he said, ‶No, the other way.‶  Damn!  He wanted to see her butthole!  Not that he wouldn't see her pussy too.  Feeling awkward in her nakedness, all breasts and butt and bare feet, Hyacinth turned around and got on all fours.  This was a well-practiced pose, along with the rest of the standard presenting postures Professor Reddy had the girls go through to begin each ‶erotocize‶ class, but Hyacinth always felt awkward doing it ‶in real life‶.<br><br>‶Spread open, please.‶  And now she rested her head on its side and reached back to spread her butt cheeks.  Though the electric lamp did not provide much light Ahmad would see every wrinkle of her butthole up close, the stretched skin between it and her pussy, every little pussy hair at the bottom of her pussy, the beginnings of her lower lips, then the lips themselves.  She prayed there would be no female scent like with Mac.  And now she looked back at him, part of the prescribed routine.<br><br>Fortunately he didn't make eye contact, staring at her lower crevice appreciatively.  But now came another request.  ‶May I spread your buttocks further?‶<br><br>The college rules prohibited nonconsensual touching.  But this was a request occasionally made.  The request had to be specific about what was going to be touched and how.  The female had to answer affirmatively; no answer was to be understood as a refusal.  The rules were very clear about that.  Hyacinth looked up at Mac.  Again the small reassuring smile.  Well, it wasn't like he wanted to stick his finger in there.  Hyacinth cleared her throat and said, ‶O.K.‶<br><br>She felt the hands gently push her butt cheeks apart further.  She let go with her own hands and folded them under her turned face.  Ahmad pulled and stretched Hyacinth's buttocks this way and that, and the girl felt her sphincter tugged in different directions.  Halfway through, Tommy leaned over to look.  A little draft of cold air came in through the slightly-open tent flap and Hyacinth felt it hit right on her sphincter, which clenched reflexively, no doubt to the great interest and attention of the two guys.  She closed her eyes, bit her lip, trying to hold down the intense shame.  This was the lot of any BSC girl: to be naked all the time, and to have her most secret parts on display and examined closely by any guy at all.  Naked and not being able to do anything about it, totally in these guys' control.<br><br>But now she opened her eyes and looked up at Mac, strong and undefeated.  How could she be so?  Her thoughts were interrupted by Scott, who said, ‶Mac, I'd like to see you like that too.‶<br><br>The athletic girl got on all fours opposite Hyacinth; in the cramped tent this meant that her face was right next to the other girl's.  And she stuck her butt up toward Scott's face.  Scott didn't ask to touch her, content just to look as Mac spread her lower cheeks.  No one spoke.  There was heavy male breathing, the stirring of hard dicks within undershorts.<br><br>Mac turned her face and the girls were face to face, each looking upside down at the other's eyes.  Hyacinth blinked and her eyes got a little wet as the two naked girls looked at each other in comfort and commiseration and with another feeling, a feeling Hyacinth had felt when lying together with her roommates and a feeling that was in the twinkle in Sarah's eyes, a feeling of . . .<br><br>The moment was over when all four guys seemed to say at the same time, ‶Thank you.‶  Ahmad let go of Hyacinth's cheeks.  The two girls got up and folded their legs, going back to their spots.<br><br>Then Scott said impulsively, ‶Could you two do a sixty-nine for us?‶<br><br>Mac glared at him.  ‶NO.‶<br><br>Scott said, ‶Oh, come on.‶<br><br>Mac looked at Hank, who was already looking at Scott.  ‶Hey, man.  Give it a rest.‶<br><br>‶No really.‶<br><br>Mac shrugged and reached over into a corner to get a rolled up sleeping bag.  ‶No offense guys, but we're going,‶ she said, and before Hyacinth knew it she was being dragged outside into the freezing black night.<br><br>God it was cold!!  Hyacinth stumbled at first as Mac, the bag under one arm, pulled her farther and farther into the night.  Her bumped against unseen rocks and stepped on pointy clumps of brush.  She looked back at the lit, warm tent, the shadows of the guys' heads, realizing that a minute ago one could have seen the shadows of her and her naked friend presenting, and then the tent got small and went out of sight as Mac turned into a stand of trees and then up a little promontory and down the other side.<br><br>Hyacinth crouched and wrapped her arms around herself as Mac unrolled the sleeping bag with one motion and unzipped it while still in the air.  ‶Mac, it's freezing!  This is crazy!‶<br><br>‶Actually it's probably a few degrees above it,‶ Mac said.  ‶Don't worry, this bag is rated to twenty below.‶  She flung it onto the ground and opened the end.  ‶Hop in.‶<br><br>Hyacinth dove in to the sleeping bag, and though the silky waterproof fabric was a little cold, it was better than the freezing air outside.  She curled up into a ball, holding her freezing toes in her hands, but then moved over as Mac slid in next to her.  This bag was pretty roomy.  The two girls hugged each other for warmth, arms around each other, legs intertwined, the wonderful, precious feeling of full body skin against skin that all BSC women learned to treasure.  Hyacinth's face lay in the nape of the taller girl's neck.  She was conscious of the fur of their pussies resting against each other, becoming one tangled female forest.<br><br>‶Brrr,‶ Hyacinth said, though she was quickly getting warm.  ‶Eeek!‶ she said as Mac playfully pressed cold toes into her thigh.  The girls' breathing slowly quieted as their metabolisms relaxed.<br><br>After a moment, Hyacinth said, ‶What was all that about?‶  It was a little uncomfortable back in the tent when Scott asked to touch her, but she felt confident with Mac and Hank around.  But when Scott asked her and Mac to do ‶sixty-nine‶!  Not only was it icky, Hyacinth never having had any lesbian urges, it was like Scott considered them some kind of, not whores exactly, but performers who were there to do what he wanted.<br><br>‶Scott is a virgin and he's still not totally BSC yet,‶ Mac said, shifting a bit so she could hold Hyacinth's head against her shoulder.  ‶Sometimes he acts like he's walked into a living Penthouse magazine.  I'm sure Hank's having a few words with him right now.‶<br><br>‶Wow . . . a virgin.‶  Not that Hyacinth had been having any relationships during her time at Blanke Schande, being still too shy about being naked around guys.  But she had heard that at Alturas everyone was in bed with someone or other.<br><br>‶Yes, and it must be rough, living around all these naked women.  We've thought about one of us women making it with him, just to get him over that.  But it would be like leaving milk out for a stray cat, he'll just keep coming back.  Cruel as that sounds.‶<br><br>Hyacinth so enjoyed snuggling with Mac in this warm little cocoon.  Hints of cold air came in from the open flap above them.  Now she felt sorry for Scott.  ‶What a shame.‶<br><br>‶I think he'll be O.K.,‶ Mac said.  ‶Almost everyone here at Alturas is getting some.  It won't be long.‶<br><br>‶Mmmmm . . .‶ Hyacinth said as they snuggled closer in their cocoon, feeling their furry pussies against each other, then she felt a little embarrassed at being so vocal.  She hardly knew Mac, it wasn't like she was with her buds in the dorm suite.  Yet all BSC women were sisters in nakedness, they knew they had a bond even the first time they met, and Hyacinth decided it was nothing to be embarrassed about.<br><br>The taller girl craned her neck down a little and softly kissed Hyacinth on the lips, like the standard BSC greeting between females but slower.  Hyacinth found herself responding, embarrassed a little again.  She had done this kind of kissing before, but always with a guy.<br><br>‶So how do you like the naked life?‶ Mac said.<br><br>Hyacinth grunted.  ‶Don't ask.  Thank God I have my friends.‶  She shifted and lifted one of her breasts up to a more comfortable position.  ‶I hope I don't sag.‶<br><br>‶Don't worry.  What are you, a 34 D?‶<br><br>‶Good guess.‶<br><br>‶We play that game in my dorm,‶ Mac said.  ‶Even though it's a dumb idea, we end up wishing we had our bras again.‶  Another shift, limbs rubbing, bellies undulating against each other, another cold draft from above, welcome as they breathed in the clean forest air while being warm and snug below.  ‶Sarah is a 36 double-D, and she seems O.K.  It's the exercise.‶<br><br>To Hyacinth it seemed like her whole life at BSC was exercise.  Three sessions a day were required, the morning aerobics at 9, ‶Anatomy and Movement‶ (a.k.a. erotocize) at 1 p.m., then the full-hour workout at 7 p.m.  The morning session was in the main hall, on a platform in full view of anyone who was passing by, and there usually was a steady crowd of guys looking up, new guys coming up as the others left, now and then professors and staff and administrators, seeing the girls' sweaty naked bouncing bodies from every angle.  Hyacinth was in the best shape she had ever been in, and was secretly proud of the hard, concave belly she had acquired.  And it was a nice feeling of freedom to exercise naked.  But she still longed for her old sneakers and sweats, and would never get used to being up there naked and exposed, showing everything she had to anyone who wanted to look!<br><br>Hyacinth asked the question that had been on her mind all day.  ‶How can you stand it, when it snows?‶ Hyacinth said.  ‶I just couldn't step out in bare feet and in that cold air.‶<br><br>‶We keep moving.‶  Probably realizing this was the standard response Alturas women gave to their main campus sisters, Mac elaborated.  ‶No really.  It's not that big a deal.  The secret is to know that there's nothing to be afraid of.  You actually get used to it and don't mind it after a while.‶<br><br>‶I just can't believe that.  Isn't it dangerous?  Won't you get frostbite or something?‶<br><br>‶I asked that once from Tereshkova, she teaches physiology.  I said, ‘Aren't we pushing the envelope?'  She said‶ -- Mac tried to imitate a Russian accent -- ‶‘No, is not near enfelope.  We are nowhere near enfelope.'  She used to do hypothermic surgery in Russia.‶<br><br>‶What?‶<br><br>‶They put you under then chill the body to seventy degrees or something like that.  It helps prevent infection.‶<br><br>Hyacinth shuddered, and hugged Mac tighter.<br><br>‶Then there's Olga,‶ Mac said.  Hyacinth had walked by her when she and Jessie when they were walking to Sarah's suite in the dorm.  A chunky, tough-looking girl who was smoking a cigarette, somewhat of a rarity among BSC students.  ‶Olga's from Siberia.‶<br><br>‶God -- she doesn't go naked there too, does she?‶<br><br>‶No.  She gets asked that all the time.  ‘F--- no!' she says.  ‘It gets fifty below a lot of nights.  I'd be dead!' . . . She's got a mouth on her.  And she smokes these pukey cigarettes her dad sends her.  They smell like gasoline.‶<br><br>Hyacinth grimaced, remembering the smell.  She could sense Mac grimacing as well.  It was too dark to see anything in the sleeping bag but the two girls could sense each other's expressions.  Hyacinth turned her head and she knew Mac could feel her breath going down on the top of the taller girl's breast.  They couldn't see each other but could hide no secrets from each other.<br><br>‶Olga used to work in a hospital where she saw REAL frostbite victims, some had to have their hands and feet amputated, but that's because they were out in forty below all night without gloves, or got drunk on vodka and passed out in the snow.  Last year she went outside one night when it was five below, near that shower.‶  Hyacinth had seen the shower head on the corner of the academic building right on the little quad, no doubt used by some of the more uninhibited girls as the whole campus watched.  At the main campus there were showers all over, and Hyacinth swore she would never use one.  It was just too embarrassing, and too much a treat for the guys, though some girls who she thought were shy as she was sometimes succumbed to the temptation, a quick pass under the shower being just the thing on a hot day.<br><br>‶The shower was shut off for the winter but she walked right onto the ice patch and leaned back right under the light, stretched her arms out, and lit up.  She stayed there the whole five minutes or whatever until the cigarette was done.  We all watched from inside, shuddering.  I couldn't stand it finally, I opened the window a crack and yelled for her to come in.  She just shrugged, took her time, and when she was finished she just stamped the butt out with her foot and sauntered back in like it was nothing.‶<br><br>‶Amazing.  She must have a death wish.‶<br><br>‶I asked her later, she said, ‘At forty below, my hands and toes would be bit, at seventy below, I'd be dead.  But five below for five minutes is nothing.'  Of course, she had a tub of hot water waiting for her.‶  A little giggle, which Hyacinth shared in.  ‶She's right though.  You get tough after a while.  Something else too.  During the winter all us girls eat like pigs, and put on a little fat.  The guys get a kick out of it in the dining hall, seeing us girls go to the salad bar over and over.  Then spring comes and we get back to fighting weight again.‶<br><br>The two girls lay intertwined, listening to the wind rustle the branches outside.  Carried on the wind was a faint word or two from the guys in the tent, some distance away on the other side of the rise.<br><br>‶Gotta pee.‶  Mac scooted up and slipped away, her toes scraping past Hyacinth's breasts.  Hyacinth listened to the breaking of twigs under tough bare feet going into the distance, then heard the squirting onto the leaves.  She pictured the lithe athlete squatting down in the freezing forest, as casual and oblivious to the cold as a wolf, steam rising from the hot little puddle.  Then more snapping of twigs coming nearer, sandpapery sounds which were probably Mac brushing the dirt off her soles, and then her hard body slithering back into the sleeping bag, the chilled skin making Hyacinth shudder.  Still, she wanted to warm her friend and took the lead in wrapping herself around her.<br><br>Mac's mouth found Hyacinth's and they again kissed on the lips.  Now a silent moment.  Hyacinth knew what was about to happen and was nervous.  Their lips met again and Mac opened hers and her tongue explored, in a more artful way than a guy's would, yet still strong and assertive.  They were in their own world now, a world encompassed by the sleeping bag and the immediate surroundings, a world with only two persons.  The college, their families, anything anyone would think, these were all far away now.  The two girls were hidden, no one could see them or anything they did, clothed by the borders of their little universe.  Hyacinth found herself exploring as well and now they got more passionate, pressing their lips against each other's, grinding the fur of their pussies together, feeling their hard nipples meet and rub each other raw.  They drew apart, and Hyacinth felt the electric tickling of Mac's fingers as they danced barely perceptible whispers on her pubic hair.<br><br>Hyacinth lay her head on Mac's shoulder again.  ‶Did that feel good?‶ Mac said.  Hyacinth surprised herself by saying, ‶VERY good.‶<br><br>And now like a driver doing a jack-knife Mac rose and bent around and dove down.  Hyacinth sensed her head brushing past, felt the cold air from above, then the slightly chilled breasts and hard nipples and midriff and now the thighs coming down, felt one thigh bending and she put her head up on it like a pillow, the other thigh above, soft and strong at the same time.  She opened her thighs and felt Mac's head resting down there too, each girl a mirror image of the other, and she held her breath as she sensed the heat of Mac's pussy in front of her and now felt Mac's breath on her inner thighs and pussy and waited --<br><br>‶Oh!‶<br><br>Mac's skilled tongue drilled right into Hyacinth's core and she felt her lower body turning to jelly.  She hadn't known how ripe and ready she was and within seconds she was pulled over the waterfall.  ‶Ohh -- God -- OHHHH!!‶  The loud groans filled their little bag-shaped universe, she barely having a mind to think of how loud and uninhibited they were.<br><br>And when the spasms died down Mac went at her again!  It was joy, joy upon joy, the greatest pleasure she had ever known, as Hyacinth's body rocked side to side, half trying to escape Mac's insistent tongue, feeling like she was being driven out of her mind.  Finally after who knows how many crests Mac withdrew her tongue, then with long gentle strokes licked the entire length of Hyacinth's outer lips.  By then Hyacinth felt so grateful she had to give her back something, with all her skill and all her love.  She had never done this, but in the hot humid blackness in front of her she tried to imitate what Mac had done, finding the hard little knob of her clit, pressing against it, then flicking it up and down.<br><br>Mac's orgasm was a torrent of groans and shouts, of spasming thighs that squeezed Hyacinth's head like a nutcracker, but Hyacinth grabbed onto Mac's hips with an iron grip of her circled arms and would not let go, staying with the tall athletic girl until the last spasm.  Then she let go, her tongue a little sore, and rested her head back on Mac's thigh like on a pillow.<br><br>There was nothing but hot humid blackness and the gradual subsiding of long heavy breaths by the two nude young women.  Then Mac started absently playing with Hyacinth's lower lips with her fingers.  ‶Feel good?‶<br><br>Hyacinth laughed, a deep womanly belly laugh.  Her voice was low too, a well-f**cked voice.  ‶God, god . . . Jesus . . . Thank you . . . I never . . . oh god . . . That was wonderful!‶  And she drew forward and kissed Mac's moist vulva.<br><br>As they lay there in total darkness, each unable to see a thing, Hyacinth felt a question coming and got brave and answered it.  ‶That was my . . . my first time.‶<br><br>A low giggle from Mac.  ‶So good to be with you in our snug little world.‶<br><br>‶I thought you and Hank -- ‶  As the girls' breathing got back to normal, they got back to talking, pleasantly spent, still facing into each other's crotches.<br><br>‶Oh we are.  I'm a happy het,‶ Mac said.  ‶Hank has the God of All Dicks.  We're at it constantly.  I can't be a lesbian, I must have a dick in me.  I drink him too, twice a day.‶<br><br>‶Oh really?‶ Hyacinth was amused.  ‶Oooh!‶ she jerked a little as Mac pulled on her still-sensitive clit.<br><br>‶I'm addicted to his juice.  I make sure he eats a bunch of parsley each night, it makes it taste sweet.‶<br><br>‶How did you find that out?‶<br><br>‶Jessica, she was my ‘buddy'.  She's graduated now.  She hated giving head at first but got converted by parsley.‶<br><br>‶I'll remember that,‶ Hyacinth said with amusement.  ‶Next time I . . . I'm like you, a ‘happy het', of course.‶<br><br>‶Of course.  There's not too many lesbians at Blanke Schande, though a lot of us do this once in a while.  It's not. . .‶  Mac was thoughtful.  ‶It's not romantic, more like something . . . sisterly, friendly.‶<br><br>Hyacinth thought for a moment.  ‶There are some nice guys at the main campus.‶<br><br>‶So you haven't -- well I suppose you wouldn't yet.‶<br><br>‶No,‶ Hyacinth said.  ‶It's not kicked in yet, I have to wait a few more weeks.‶  They were talking about the special powder put on the pathways at BSC campuses, or mixed in with the sand put on the Alturas paths over the snow in winter.  Everyone was told about it at orientation.  Absorbed through the girls' bare soles, it contained a contraceptive and also a vaccine against several sexual diseases.  For new female students the contraceptive took two months to become effective.  In the odd case where a female student actually wanted to get pregnant, she would put in for an ‶antidote‶ pill which she would take every week at the health center.<br><br>Upon hearing this arrangement some girls dropped out of orientation, though this was often just a pretext because they were beginning to realize they really didn't want to go through four years of college in the nude.  But to most of the others it just seemed like good sense, no need to remember to take a pill every day.<br><br>For Hyacinth, it had not yet been two months, not that she was in a hurry to get it on with the guys.  There was still that shyness, that weirdness about trying to approach guys who had already seen you naked all the time.  But here in the blind humid femaleness of the sleeping bag, Hyacinth was not shy with this companion whom she could not see but could sense and feel in every other way.<br><br>Mac poked her finger into Hyacinth's pussy, making her jump.  ‶Ready to go again?‶<br><br>‶Oh God, you'll kill me.‶<br><br>‶I got six out of you, you can do some more,‶ Mac said.<br><br>‶Six -- OH!  God! --‶  And though she squeezed her thighs in a feeble effort to push Mac away, Hyacinth surrended to the assault yet again, laughing, moaning, exhausted, curious, wondering at this new experience and how normal and healthy and natural it now seemed . . . And in her trancelike state she found her own tongue, despite its soreness, stretching out to flick that clit again -- and they were once again whirling each other around weightless in their private black-hole universe and at the same time holding onto each other --<br><br>.    .    .    .<br><br>From somewhere Hyacinth heard the scrape of gravel from all sides.  She turned her head and felt the blast of light through her closed lids.  She squinted her eyes open and saw up around her a circle of guys, Hank closest, then Scott and Tommy and Ahmad, standing over them in their big hiking boots and jeans and sweatshirts.<br><br>She blushed and almost tried to cover her breasts, but suppressed the urge.  ‶Mmmm . . .‶  She nudged the warm softness under her and realized that she and Mac were lying on the ground, only their hips and legs still in the sleeping bag, exposed down to the hip bones like low-rise jeans, her head resting on Mac's breasts like a baby's.<br><br>The two women dragged themselves out of the sleeping bag into the chilly sunny mountain air and lurched to their feet, staggering and still half awake, naked in the middle of the circle of fully clothed, admiring males.  Hyacinth hugged herself, not so much out of modesty (though she was plenty ashamed) as from the cold.  The air could be fairly described as freezing, and she was sure she could see a little of her breath.  She had the intense urge to embrace Mac in a tender full-body hug, but resisted.  Mac took the lead as usual, slapping her breasts up and down and shaking herself awake, then bending over to straighten out the bag, giving everyone a clear view of her upturned butt and anus, her breasts jiggling as she made little steps forward on tough bare feet to roll the bag up.<br><br>Then Mac hefted the tied-up bag onto her shoulder and, taking Hyacinth by the hand, led everyone back to the campsite.  ‶Coffee's on,‶ Hank said, like a lieutenant reporting to his commanding officer.  ‶Good,‶ she said.<br><br>As Hyacinth sat with the others around the little fire, shrouded in a rough blanket which did little to protect her from the coldness on her butt from the big stone she was on, drinking the cowboy-style coffee Hank had made, munching on an apple, she glanced around, hoping nobody's eyes would meet hers.  It was just so obvious that these guys knew what she and Mac had been doing in that bag.  How could they not?  She dreaded any mention of it, felt her face get hot with a blush as she thought about it, and had a fleeting image of her and Mac casually getting into a sixty-nine on the ground, right in front of the guys, as they folded up their things and broke down the tent to get ready to go.  Ridiculous, tacky, like something nude dancers would do, or so she imagined, yet oddly appropriate.<br><br>Fortunately nobody said anything.  Instead, some idle chatter about the nice clean air, and as if in a hurry they were soon getting organized and heading back.<br><br>Down they went the cliff, the guys going first, and of course as Hyacinth held the rope and trod her way down all she could only think of her splayed-out legs and Scott, who was right under her, looking up at her spread crotch.  But looking down she saw that Scott's attention necessarily was directed downward to where he was heading.  Just a little ways and then Hyacinth stopped and looked at the top of the stand of trees in view, the last glance of ‶Tami's Clothes‶.  She looked up at Mac.  They smiled at each other, another secret they shared.<br><br>The sun was warm on her butt, though not enough to remove the chill.  It was COLD!  Hyacinth wished time would go by so she was once again in the yummy warm sunshine of yesterday afternoon, she found herself missing the near-tropical warmth of the main BSC campus.  She felt the goosebumps on her front, her nipples felt as hard as little rocks as they walked through the brush, the girls once again carrying the backpacks as the guys carried the sleeping bags and climbing equipment.  A creek was up ahead.  Suddenly Mac shucked her backpack and pranced up to the stream.  ‶Come on, Hy,‶ she yelled, to Hyacinth's horror jumping right into the waist-deep water.<br><br>‶No way!‶ Hyacinth said.  ‶That water must be freezing! -- No, no!‶  Mac had rushed up to her and yanked her hand.  ‶No, are you nuts!‶<br><br>‶It'll warm you up!‶<br><br>‶Yeah right!‶  Mac was so strong that Hyacinth couldn't shake herself free as she was pulled to her doom.  Behind, the guys ran to catch up.<br><br>‶EEEEK!‶  It was like liquid ice, the cold water of the stream, as it knifed into Hyacinth's crotch, numbing her legs and feet so she could hardly feel the rocky bottom.  ‶NOO!‶  Now Mac pulled her down and she was submerged!<br><br>It was so silly, so horrible, Hyacinth's screams started mixing with laughs as she and Mac took turns dunking each other, falling sideways and backwards as their numb feet slipped on the rocks below, drenching each other in the stream as the guys watched.<br><br>Walking onward a few minutes later, the towel around her head, the backpack scraping her shoulder blades, avoiding the little cactuses with feet caked with dried-on mud, Hyacinth realized that she felt a lot warmer now.  A good cold dunk was just the thing.  Just like so much at Blanke Schande, crazy but it worked.<br><br>.    .    .    .<br><br>‶Clothes, clothes, clothes, my whole life is clothes,‶ Keisha said, her dark brown body sweating all over as she put another shirt on the ironing board in the hot laundry room.  She wiped back her cornrows, then tied them back behind her, her breasts wiggling, the big black nipples dancing back and forth, then resumed her labors.  ‶These guys have so many clothes, I never realized it.‶  She turned up a collar and spritzed it with starch.  ‶This is it, the last day.  Next year, I'll sign up for something else.‶<br><br>Hyacinth watched, partly with bemusement, partly with delectable hunger, as she saw Jessie's friend toiling.  She felt like saying something along the lines of, It must be agony, being around clothes so much, yet not being allowed to put any on yourself.  But of course Keisha knew that and saying it might just make it worse.<br><br>Hyacinth was waiting for Jessie to clean up.  Jessie was outside at the shower, no doubt with guys watching, a scene Hyacinth could do without, so here she was, hanging out with another one of Jessie's old suite-mates in the basement of the men's dorm.  Keisha had been ‶purchashed‶ by this dorm at the last frat-sorority ‶slave sale‶, where in exchange for a donation to charity each girl had signed up for a task.  Keisha's was to do the laundry for two weeks.  A black girl signing up as a ‶slave‶ for a dorm of, mostly, white guys -- Hyacinth liked the absence of any sense of irony.  In the abundance of female skin at Blanke Schande, issues of skin color somehow disappeared.  Maybe it was just because naked women are good to look at, no matter what the hue.<br><br>It might have been against the rules, but Hyacinth just couldn't let Keisha labor alone, and soon she was helping her, folding the ironed clothes and putting the shirts on hangers. It was agony, of course.  Everything she touched, Hyacinth longed to put on, longed to slip one of these pairs of white tube socks onto her bare feet.  Her whole body tingled as fabric ran past her erect nipple.  But if Keisha could withstand it, so could she, damn it!<br><br>Now, back in the second floor of the women's dorm, Sarah's suite in fact, waiting to start the day-long trip south back to southern California and the main campus.  Jessie seemed to know everyone here.  She wanted to take Hyacinth along to say her good-byes, but the new girl preferred to sit cross-legged on the floor in the suite and watch TV.  As she half-paid attention to one of those MTV shows where they visit a rich actress and show you her mansion and swimming pool, Sarah came up from downstairs, carrying a notebook.<br><br>‶You look beat,‶ Hyacinth said, which was the truth.  Sarah's usual bubbliness was subdued by the all-nighter she had just pulled.  Her eyes were tired little slits, even her large breasts seemed a little droopy, her nipples soft and pale, as if as tired as her eyes.  ‶Big test at three.‶  Sarah turned wearily to look at the clock.  ‶Ten thirty.  I can get four hours sleep.  That's good.‶<br><br>A girl came out of the bathroom with a towel piled high on her head.  This was Marti, the dorm's fashion plate, acknowledging the visitor and then getting to the serious business of dressing for her eleven o'clock class.  ‶Marti, when you get back make sure I wake up at two thirty?‶ Sarah said wearily.  Marti nodded as Sarah went out to the porch that overlooked the campus where a large couch lay in the sun.<br><br>Marti started ‶dressing‶, Hyacinth watching out of the corner of her eye.  Combing her hair, braiding it, tying it back.  Make-up.  Mascara.  Earrings.  Now, some touch-up on her fingernails.  Finally, bringing one foot up to the table and then the other, touch-up on the toenails.  Women are the same all over and, even when clothes are forbidden her, a woman so inclined will find plenty of ways to make herself pretty for the day's activities, and manage to spend a lot of time doing so.<br><br>Just before Jessie came back Hyacinth had one last view of life at BSC-Alturas, of Sarah lying on the sun-warmed sofa on the porch.  The sofa could be seen from anywhere on the quad, Hyacinth guessed, and she furtively approached from behind, noticing the sight of Sarah's foot propped up on the wide wooden rail.  The other foot, she saw, was propped up far to the other side.  Sarah, the notebooks on the floor, was spread out, her pussy wide open to the sun, and as Hyacinth watched in amazement the blonde girl slowly stroked her pussy, eyes closed, her big breasts lolling slowly from side to side like mountains of jello on her chest as her stroking increased, getting faster.  Her hips rose up, she gasped, toes spreading, her whole body now tensing.  Now the soft groans, the rhymthic spasms, the little cry of pleasure.  Below, the campus day went on.  Perhaps a few people were looking up, but if they were, the big-breasted naked blonde girl was not aware of it, instead curling up when the last spasm was spent, then stretching out like a lazy cat on the sofa, bringing her feet underneath, her head resting on its side, and in a few seconds there was the loud snoring of a happy woman.<br><br>Now, booming along Route 385 in Jessie's Taurus, watching the Sierras go by, Hyacinth saw a stand of trees that looked familiar.  In fact every stand of trees they passed by looked familiar in the same way, and she thought of repeating the prayer Mac had said in  that natural, or maybe woman-made, cathedral.  She thought of what Jessie said to her a few hours ago: ‶Wendy Mac tells me you're a Tami now.‶  So Jessie had been initiated too.  Being a Tami: it sounded like a high honor, Hyacinth was flattered.  Could she live up to it?" },
      { title: "Life of Corey Part 1", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "To begin with, I am so very lucky.  And no matter how much bare female skin I see around me I just can't help looking and looking.  The same is true of all the guys here, even Dexter and Francesco, who are gay.  So lucky to be surrounded by so much beauty.<br><br>And it doesn't get boring, even after three semesters.  Naked girl after naked girl, each body is a feast in itself, a story in itself, that reveals more and more the more you look.  How do I mean this? In high school you could tell a girl's personality as much by her clothes, it seemed, as by her face.  There was this one girl, Merrie, who was a Phish-head, she always wore flowing hippie dresses and knit vests.  Jerry was the school fashion plate, every fingernail perfectly done, each lace on her brand-new sneakers set just so.  Trish was the utter nerd, big glasses, unstyled hair, boy's sports shirt buttoned up to the top.  Traci was in a constant storm, always breaking up with someone and telling the world about it -- and she dressed to be noticed, backless shirts, super-low-rise jeans where you could see her thong sticking out the back.<br><br>With the women at BSC Alturas, not allowed to wear clothes, I find their naked bodies -- their breasts are, well, as expressive as their face, they have a personality of their own, which fits their real personality like a second pair of eyes.  Stacey Peaches, for example, who has ‶itty bitty titties‶, the little nipples poke out cock-eyed, just like she is, looking kooky.  Wendy Macalester (or ‶Mac‶, as everyone's starting to call her), her breasts are tan and hard like the rest of her, the nipples looking straight ahead, focused on where they're going.  Shelly, the really shy girl, hers are always half-retracted (except when it's cold), as if wanting to hide.  Sandy, the older woman, around 35 or so, she's been a nudist for years, I hear.  Her breasts, kind of big, they sag a little, but the nipples, stretched looking and a little droopy, kind of wink at you, as if they've been through a lot but it's been a real good ride.  Keisha, who is black (or dark brown really), well her nipples really are jet black and always hard, jutting out into the world, pioneering like she always seems to be doing, plunging into new things.  And then Sarah's, the biggest breasts on campus, balloons bouncing along as big as life itself, the huge brown nipples dancing like at a party, happy and active just like Sarah is.<br><br>I could go on and on about each girl's breasts, and also each girl's midriff, each girl's thighs, etc.  There are thirty girls here, and thirty guys, up in this mountain outpost, the Alturas campus of Blanke Schande College.  If ‶the Rules‶ were suddenly changed and the girls decided to go around with faces hidden in ski caps, we guys could still recognize them by their breasts, and talk to them that way too, which is how most of them think we talk to them anyway.<br><br>This body-personality business is especially intense when it's cold out.  We were sitting around a few days ago outside, me and Hank and Ahmad and Mac, and she was standing up next to me, talking about her favorite thing, rock climbing, and I looked over and right next to me were her breasts, flushed and red with the cold, which made them tighter, her whole torso seeming even harder than usual, the nipples poking out, hard as pebbles and red-brown, and as I looked more I suddenly realized she was covered with little goose-bumps all over.  And she was oblivious to the cold as she was answering a question about, well I forget.<br><br>‶Um, Corey?‶  she said, trying to get my attention back to her words.  She was nice about it, though.  The girls understand our obsession with their bodies, we're just guys after all, and treat it with good-natured tolerance.<br><br>‶How do they stand it?‶  is another thing we think about, along with everyone at the main campus, especially the girls there, most of whom have never gotten comfortable with walking around naked in the warm weather and think of Alturas women as totally nuts.  Most of the school year, snow is in evidence around the campus here, and there are blizzards and some truly Arctic nights, yet the girls have to be naked at all times, and though they keep the heat in their dorm cranked to about 80 degrees (or so it seems to us clothed guys, we start sweating as soon as we walk in), they don't seem to be in a hurry going from building to building outside.  I remember last year when I visited here for the first time, as we drove onto campus there were a couple of girls chasing each other in the snow, their bare toes kicking up bits of snow behind them as they ran, firing snowballs at each other.  It seemed ostentatious at the time, deliberately trying to be shocking, but of course they weren't doing it just for me, and I came to see that it was just a fun thing to do and perfectly ordinary around the Alturas campus.<br><br>Certainly the girls are conditioned.  Lisa has told me about it.  The girls all take a course on Body Awareness, taught by a Dr. Tereshkova, a Russian lady with a thick accent.  I might take it next semester; for the guys it's available as an elective.  She talks about feral children surviving naked in the snow, the physiology of frostbite, how to watch for the signs of hypothermia.  Then there's the two exercise classes the girls have to take each day that keep the metabolism up.<br><br>And the ‶five minute chill‶, which you see the new girls doing starting in October when it gets cold, with a helper who has a stopwatch.  The deal is, the new girl walks outside until she starts shivering.  Then waits five minutes more by the stopwatch, standing as still as she can, before going in to where a tub of hot water is waiting.  Gradually, like with exercise, her body builds up strength and resistance and she can stay in the cold longer and longer, until finally she can stay out quite a long time.<br><br>Actually it's not always cold here.  The typical winter day in Alturas is sunny and beautiful, and though technically the temperature is a little below freezing, in the sun it's pretty warm, enough to start melting the snow.  It's usual to see a bunch of girls sitting right in the it, or lounging around on it, enjoying the warm sun while they're talking about the usual girl things, idly playing with the snow, lifting it up with their toes, maybe even sprinkling some bits of it on their breasts or thighs where it melts and little rivers of water run down .  .  .  I'm getting carried away again.  But the point is, whoever thought that naked girls could be so unfazed and unafraid of being in snow, let alone learn to enjoy it?<br><br>Getting back to bodies, the girls' butts have personality too, we guys having a great time watching the girls after they pass.  I like the little Y-shaped dimples over their tailbones, I remember seeing just the hint of them on Traci and other girls who wore low-rise jeans, well here at Alturas I get to see the whole thing.  My favorite dimple is Lisa's, my girlfriend, thin and calm like she herself is, over those two delectable trim cheeks.  And her beautiful puckered anus in between.  I never thought of a butthole as ‶beautiful‶ before, but Lisa's is, so little and tight and perfectly drawn, the wrinkles like the stippling of a thin-lined pencil.  When we were getting closer and I was always asking her to ‶present‶, I just couldn't stop looking at it.<br><br>Let me get this out of the way: we guys have decided, after close observation: Lisa's butt cheeks are shaped like cherries.  Sandy's are like pears.  Keisha's are like pears, except they're upside down, a nice high black butt.  Mac's are like apples (how fitting).  Sandy's are oranges, and Shelly's are like kiwis, though embarrassed because they've been denuded of their furry covering.  We've discussed it endlessly and the above consensus is clear.  Sometimes when we would see a few of the girls walking together, four or six or eight butt cheeks in a row, one of us would mutters, ‶I feel like I'm in the supermarket.‶  Or: ‶Produce aisle!‶ That joke got old after a while, but we all still think it whenever the fruit goes sauntering past.<br><br>Getting back to the dimple, Lisa has a very intelligent-looking ‶Y‶.  Lisa is so beautiful all over, her knock-out face, those happy and intelligent blue eyes, her sober yet optimistic outlook on life.  I'll never forget our first kiss.  We were walking down the path behind the dining hall, it was a bright sunny afternoon, beautiful dark blue sky up in these mountains.  There was slushy snow that was quickly melting into puddles.  There wasn't a sound except some birds and us slogging along the path, me with loud slops from my boots, next to the delicate splishing of her bare feet.<br><br>We had been walking together a lot and, as I know now, she had been feeling close to me just as I was feeling close to her.  It was just ‶a matter of time‶, and our friends sensed it too.  Still I was stalling.  I said, looking down at her freezing feet, ‶I still can't see how you can do that‶.<br><br>‶You get used to it,‶ she said.  She wiggled her toes for me.  ‶I'm not even numb now, though I used to be.‶  We walked a bit and she stomped onto slush, which splatted to both sides, a little coming up onto her toes.  ‶I like this slush the best.  It looks like sugar frosting.‶<br><br>We stopped.  Why didn't I just kiss her? Looking back, it seemed so silly for me to do, but I see why I did it.  As she gaped in surprise, I stepped out of my boots, rolled off my thick hiking socks, and planted my feet square in the slushy puddle right next to hers.<br><br>We watched our feet.  It was cold, cold, cold unlike anything I'd ever known.  And then a tingling, and then my feet felt stiff and numb.  I looked up at her, past her stiff nipples and flushed, reddened, hard body, up to those pretty eyes.  We knew it was time, and drew together in a kiss.  I dropped my boots and socks and wrapped my arms around her, one around her shoulders, the other gently draped over her left butt cheek, and then we really went at it, doing the tongue thing, she grinding her breasts against my jacket as she held my head with one hand and the back of my jacket with the other.<br><br>We separated and put our heads on each other's shoulders and giggled, with relief and with the satisfaction that we had both guessed right about the other.  Hard to think of something to talk about at such a time, so maybe it was lucky that something occurred to me, namely my feet.  I discovered I couldn't move my toes, and it was starting to feel painful.<br><br>‶My feet hurt,‶ I said.  She looked down with concern.  ‶I still don't know how you do it.‶  ‶You haven't been conditioned,‶ she said.  ‶You should get inside.‶<br><br>With effort I pulled one foot up out of the puddle and I started to put my socks on but she stopped me.  ‶Wet socks is worse than nothing,‶ she said.  ‶Let's just go back, like this.‶  So we headed back to her dorm, barefoot, though I kept on stumbling, not being able to flex my feet with the rocks and unlevel path, so she helped me along." },
      { title: "Life of Corey Part 2", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "You might think, requiring the girls to be naked all the time -- what a male fantasy, what a unequal situation, females as sex slaves.  Maybe it was at one time, I don't know, but though we guys love being around naked women -- and all of them with killer bodies, by the way -- we still really don't what to make of it.  It was sprung on us as a complete surprise, I know the girls were told right away, but for those of us who checked ‶male‶ on the application, all we had seen was the college brochure, a little private college with very high admission standards, a liberal arts school.  And that fleeting reference to ‶promoting students' social and psychosexual education and awareness‶, which I took, at least, as a sign that we'd get to talk about sex a lot, which is a nice way to ‶segue‶ into actually getting it on!<br><br>I was in high school then, not far from being a virgin, and it seems so long ago now, like it was a different person.  My motivation, though natural and common, seems crude now.  Certainly going to that orientation, and having the bombshell dropped on us, that female students were naked at all times while on campus -- and were to ‶present‶ any part of their body when asked (politely) -- was some kind of life-changing event for us guys.  I almost ‶had an accident‶ in my pants, probably the other guys did too, when the girls at orientation, the ones who we had been talking with over coffee and donuts, they seemed pretty but a little nervous for some reason, as we looked at them and tried to discreetly appraise their bodies though they all were wearing heavy clothes for such warm weather -- then suddenly on the second day they walked into the room totally naked, hands over breasts and crotches, then padding over in their bare feet and sitting down among us, squirming in those metal folding chairs that must have felt like ice under their newly bared butts.  It was like we guys had walked into paradise.  The problem is, once in paradise, what do you do then?<br><br>Far from it being a male fantasy, it almost seems like a fantasy for the women sometimes.  Maybe that's going too far.  But all in all the girls often seem like they're having a better time than we are.  I've noticed two things about the guys here.  One, they are very modest about showing their bodies.  Usually, I hear, at college the guys are thinking of any way to strip, like streaking, or walking around in just their shorts, trying to turn on the girls.  Here, the roles reversed, the guys never walk around in underwear when girls are around, we even hate showing our feet.  As for showing our dicks, forget it.  We're all insecure about our size, of course for the girls everything they have is on full view 24/7, so they're in a different place.<br><br>The other thing I noticed is that, even though the mandatory exercise classes apply only to the girls, the guys are always working out, and watching what they eat.  Maybe they're afraid of being inadequate.  The BSC women, especially at Alturas, have a reputation for being horny and assertive.  Lisa being so low-key, she is almost an exception this way.  I remember going to the workout room (it's just one room here, the campus being so small) the first week I was here, and passing by Jill on the weight bench.  Her breasts are like little plums, they ride high on her chest and they're spaced well apart, and now they were rising even higher, one after the other, as she hefted fifteen-pound dumbbells over her head, one hand and then the next, huffing rhythmically, shining with sweat all over, her legs draped to each side of the bench, her shaved pussy (not that usual at Alturas for some reason) a little bit open as it splayed pressed onto the bench.  As I walked past she looked at me, then right at my crotch, as if trying to guess what was hidden in my shorts, then looked up at me again.  Pure, unabashed lust.  It was pretty intimidating.  I felt like she was about to throw the dumbbells down and tackle me and rip my clothes off.<br><br>I think the guys here work out so much because they're trying to be as good as the girls.  The girls have got it all -- beauty, strength, intelligence -- all except clothes.  We guys can only hope that we can ‶measure up‶ to them!  Weird, right?<br><br>That's my theory anyway.  Fortunately I don't feel too inadequate because Lisa makes me feel like the Total Love Man.  She worships my dick, sucks on it every day, and we find plenty of places to get it on -- deliberately, I think; there seem to be a lot of unused rooms and secluded places around campus.  At Alturas everyone gets paired up.  Even Scott, the only obvious virgin on campus, lost his virginity to Shelly, and the two are now together a lot, though they both seem (this is silly but also kind of cute) shy at the fact that they are together.<br><br>Scott used to be the coarsest one at asking girls to ‶present‶ -- there's a right way and a wrong way to ask, and a right time and a wrong time -- but now he's calmed down.  Now that we all know each other, and the novelty (although not the desire to look) has worn off, a guy generally asks a girl to present if he wants her to feel good, because what always follows is a string of compliments -- ‶you have a beautiful anus, Keisha‶, or ‶I love your clitoris, Mac, it looks real big today‶.  No matter how many times we see it -- and every male on campus by now is fully familiar with the size and shape of each girl's pussy, clit, pussy lips and butthole -- our inevitable response to the sight of a naked girl's ‶private parts‶ is always pretty mindless worshipful babbling.<br><br>With the guys having regular sex, once you've gotten your rocks off, it gets a lot easier to concentrate on schoolwork.  It's amazing, it seems impossible with naked girls around, but the fact is, we are digesting courses like Advanced Calculus and Igneous Sedimentology with ease.  It's hard work, but after shooting your load your head clears and you can really use all your brain.<br><br>The girls use their brains too, they certainly are high achievers, though they find plenty of time to talk.  Lisa tells me about their conversations.  They lie together at night, skin to skin, on the big bed they've made in their suite from pushing the four beds together.  A big tangle of naked flesh, I've walked in on them like that a couple of times.  I could see where Lisa's face was, but if each girls' feet and toes didn't have their own personality too, I wouldn't have been able to tell which of the limbs of this multi-headed female creature were hers.<br><br>Anyway, Lisa tells me of the dreams they have.  You might expect girls in their situation to have unusual dreams, mostly about being naked, and it's true.  Mac told her a dream about being stuck on the other side of the country, in Rhode Island or Vermont maybe, totally naked with no money and no I.D., and trying to get clothes from anyone she met, begging for something to put on, but everyone was mean and wouldn't give her anything, and she finally had to walk clear across the country back to California, eating stuff off trees, sleeping under the stars, climbing over the Rockies, all the time stark naked, and when she finally got back to her home town and her friends gave her things to wear, she found she had become allergic to clothes!  That was when her dream ended.<br><br>Sarah had a dream about being a scientific exhibit, living in a glass cage on a pedestal, totally naked, no blankets, just a bare plastic bed, clear plastic so that every inch of her was on display all the time, even while she slept.  People milled around and visited, looking at her from every angle, as she exercised, and even as she peed and pooped into a hole going to a tube, where her excretions were measured and analyzed.  And she was stuck in that cage forever!<br><br>Lisa had a dream that made her blush when she told me about it.  She was in a courtroom and on the witness stand, a big trial, TV cameras on her, naked of course, and not only that, but she was tied to this scaffold-like thing with seats for four women who were sucking her nipples, licking her pussy, and one even sitting behind her licking her butthole!  She hated it but couldn't help having orgasms while being required to answer the questions, her sweating, contorted face on national TV.  Wild!<br><br>‶I'm thinking of becoming an Absolute, an Ultra Nude,‶ she told me out of the blue one day.  These are girls who have pledged to stay naked even off campus, even during breaks, in other words, never wear a scrap of clothing or shoes ever again.  ‶I don't know why, it seems crazy, but I can't get the idea out of my head.‶<br><br>Like all the girls (except for Sandy, the nudist, who seems to forget that she is naked), Lisa has cravings for clothes.  How could she even consider becoming an Absolute, and not have that intense feeling of relief that all the girls have when the semester is over -- ‶Aaaahhhhh!!‶ is how they all describe it -- and they slip on clothes again when they start off for home.  Also, being an Absolute is logistically difficult.  Maybe not if the girl's rich and can go to some estate or touristy secluded place, but for an average girl like Lisa? She's from Merced, a kind of blah city in the cow country, her parents are teachers -- how could she just walk naked down H Street?<br><br>More strangeness.  I kind of hope Lisa doesn't decide to become an Absolute, I don't want her life to be hard, plus it would feel uncomfortable taking her to see my folks if she was naked.  On the other hand, the IDEA of her being naked all the time is pretty arousing.<br><br>It's all up to her, of course.  I would miss painting her nails.  It's one of our little rituals, I'm getting good at it.  She likes clear polish, yet I hear even clear nail polish is considered ‶wearing‶ something which Absolutes don't do.  I could probably still brush her hair, though.  I sit on top of her prone body lying full length on my bed, brushing stroke after stroke of her lovely, lustrous brown hair, then I turn her over and with the little brush I do her pubic hair, very carefully so as not to hit her clit or her pussy lips.  She has to hold her legs open for this, and it makes me so proud when the other guys walk in, showing them the beautiful pussy and pubic hair of my gorgeous girlfriend as I comb it, making it full and fluffy and with just a little hint of her natural perfume." },
      { title: "Life of Corey Part 3", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "The big blizzard rolled in last week, all day and all night and then more the next morning.  At Alturas the campus is never closed because of snow, everyone being so close.  The worst that happens is that maybe a class here and there is canceled if the professor has to drive in from far away, but there are only a few of those.  This blizzard hit on a Saturday so it wasn't an issue.<br><br>We all watched from inside the dorms. By the time it ended, on Sunday afternoon, it was a foot and a half, though there were drifts of four and five feet next to buildings.  The powdery whiteness was almost blinding in the sun.  We were all thinking the same thing.  The grounds crew would plow the academic and administration areas, but it was up to us to get the residential area done, and this would be a big job.<br><br>Olga, the girl from Siberia who likes to show off how rugged she is, was the first out, with her usual flourish.  She jumped from the second story of the women's dorm into a drift that was so high that when she landed she was in up to her neck.  ‶Jesus,‶ Hank said, cringing, we all thinking how the snow must have felt pushing up into her lower crevices, but of course BSC girls know what to expect.  It's all in the mind.  With an absolutely deadpan face Olga pushed and hopped her way over to the front door to where it was only a foot high, snow sticking to her all over, and opened it.  Mac was already there, with the snow shovel each dorm had in the closet near the door, and in a second we saw Mac's strong, tanned body was bent down, her muscles taut and lovely, her tummy almost freakishly concave, as she began shoveling out a path.<br><br>The girls were quick to get out, but we guys first had to get through the ritual of putting on pants, boots, jackets, gloves .  .  .  Olga trudged over to the supply shed where there were extra shovels, then showed up at our door.  ‶Let's go, weenies!‶ she said in her tough-girl Russian accent, one of her pukey-smelling cigarettes lit up and hanging from her lips.  And so off we began.  The sun got warm and we were exerting ourselves, five guys and six girls, except for Shelly, who had hurt her ankle while running track last week and was limping around carrying out water to everyone.  We needed water because we were sweating, all of us, even the naked girls, droplets appearing on their foreheads and on their shoulders.  I took off my coat and then my sweatshirt.  (By the way, I have to revise what I said about a typical winter's day in Altura being below freezing.  According to weatherunderground.com, the daily high in January averages out at 42 degrees.)<br><br>Tommy Chen got adventurous and, checking that there seemed to be no sign of movement from the rest of campus, not that they could see anything with the piles of shoveled snow getting higher and higher, he decided to strip to his boots and wool socks.  Lots of hooting and joking as his pale, slightly chubby bod took its place besides the buff tans of the girls, his dick tiny and shriveled in the chilly air.  Tommy's a good sport.<br><br>‶Sure there's no one around?‶  someone said.  We all checked quickly.  Indecent exposure, at least for the guys, is still against the rules.  But Tommy shrugged off the concern, finally putting his clothes back on only after he declared, ‶My itty bitty nuts are about to freeze off!‶<br><br>Tommy was still not done, though.  He hefted a big shovel of powdery stuff and flung it to the side, as it happened right at Mac.  His phony ‶Ooops I'm sorry!‶ did not delay her counterattack for one second.  Blasted from hair to toes like with flour, she ran after him and tackled him into one of the newly-made snow banks, then pulled his pants down and rubbed a softball-sized wad of snow right into his crotch.  He screamed in fake agony and ran into the dorm, pants still around his ankles, coming back a few minutes later on his hands and knees, kissing Mac on her toes before humbly (though with a smile) getting back to clearing the path to the quad.<br><br>It was a big, big job, something you only want to do once.  We wouldn't have attempted had we not heard the forecast that there wouldn't be any more snow for the rest of the week.  We got the path between the dorms cleared, then a narrow path to the quad to where the plows would go by on Monday morning.  Then we decided to widen the paths.  We took a break, during which Shelly got us some water, and a couple of bottles of beer that we passed around.  Then started shoveling again.  Olga would finish one cigarette, rub it into the snow with her heel, then come back with another.  Lisa and I worked side by side.  I liked pretending we were a married couple clearing the path in front of our house.  Looking down, past my hiking boots, though I'm still not used to such a sight, there's nothing so sexy as seeing Lisa's bare feet on the snow.<br><br>The sun set and the temperature dropped.  Yet we were not nearly done.  The moon rose, casting a pale blue light on the snow that made it look like we were in Antarctica or the planet Pluto.  I suppose the temperature drop wasn't that great but we no longer had the warmth of the direct sun.  Soon the girls were getting seriously cold.  It was Lisa who called out, ‶Time for rubbertips,‶ and they all agreed.<br><br>The girls keep them in a little cabinet in their bathroom.  They fit over the toes and fingertips and look like five little thimbles connected by wires, with a sling back strap that on the hand goes around the wrist, and on the foot ones (shorter wires, thicker slings) goes around the heel up where the tendon is.  Stretching the sling turns on the little heating elements in the thimbles.  Powered by a little battery in a pocket that fits over the thumb and over the big toe, the thimbles stay very warm for hours.<br><br>They're like protective equipment, not really ‶clothes‶, and the girls hardly think of them that way, firstly because they're so damn ugly, secondly because they're rather uncomfortable.  The girls hate wearing them, but these ‶rubbertips‶ (there's a more complicated term for them that everyone forgets) really are a necessity if they have to be out in frigid cold for any length of time.  Once your toes and the ends of your fingers are warm, everything in between is taken care of and you don't get frostbite.  I don't think these things would help Olga in Siberia when it's fifty below (not that she'd ever go naked there), but they greatly increase the girl's ability to stay out in the cold.<br><br>Lisa threw the sets of rubbertips to the other girls and they sat their bare butts on the snow, fitting them onto their fingers and toes.  (They say that originally the foot ones were one big pocket that squished the toes together.  As you might imagine, that would be excruciating for a BSC girl, so they changed it to separate thimbles for each toe.) Fitted and warmed, the naked girls got up and helped us continue.  We widened the paths and then made another path around to the back door of each dorm.  By the time we were done it was almost nine o'clock, three hours past sunset and it was like the dead of night, hundreds of stars above.<br><br>I lay with Lisa up in the top storage room that night, under about fourteen blankets, and we were so happy in our warm little pocket sandwich, our bodies warm and naked against each other as our exposed faces breathed in the nice cold air.  We were so tired that we didn't do anything, we just fell asleep right away and, like almost everyone else, were so exhausted that we overslept and had to really rush to our morning classes.  As you can imagine, getting ready for class is much easier and faster for the girls.<br><br>I am so, so lucky!  Thank you God!  The next afternoon, Lisa and I walked back up the high path, up where the woods start in earnest, and sat down in the melting snow, feeling the warm sun, and she laid me down and pulled my dick out and gobbled it so that I was about to burst, then hopped on top of me, her furry wet warm hole taking me in, and as I looked up to her beautiful face, her eyes squeezing shut in ecstacy as her long sweaty hair flung back and forth in abandon, then heard her grunty animal-like cries ring out into the clean mountain air, and felt my dick get real big and I shot my seed up into her, spurt after spurt, like I was giving life and energy to this lovely strong woman, to all naked women -- I felt like this paradise was really as much mine as it was hers, that I was as strong and alive and vital as she was, that my seed was what kept the whole thing going.<br><br>It was the happiest I ever was, and maybe for her too.  After we finished she lay on top of me, hugging me, her bent legs to each side, wiggling her toes in the soft melting snow -- and then we had to get up and go back to the dorm, because the wet snow had soaked through my jacket and pants and with wet clothes, I was in more danger from the cold than my permanently naked girlfriend was." },
      { title: "The Problem of Grib", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "I love combing Lisette's hair in the quad.  It's a thing we do every day after lunch.  She lies on her back on one of the concrete tables, bends her knees, and lets them fall to the side, giving me a clear view of her beautiful forest of auburn curls over her vaginal lips.  I do it nice and slow, using the soft brush and then the long-handled comb, then start over.  No point to it really, she already brushes her hair every morning (actually, one of the other girls in her suite does it, it being easier for someone else to see down there, they take turns with each other), and it always looks fluffy and luxurious and fine, no doubt to that special egg conditioner they use.  But I just love brushing and combing it.  She likes it even more, she says it makes her feel loved, which she is of course.  As I brush and comb I like to sit a little to the side, so that the whole world can get a view of her beautiful crotch and her gorgeous pussy, the lips spread ever so slightly because of the splay of her legs.<br><br>Her whole body is beautiful, and it makes me so proud that I have such a beautiful girlfriend whose body is on display in the center of campus.  Not that all the other girls aren't beautiful too, the campus is alive with female loveliness.  Odd that it should be so, here at Blanke Schande where female students are supposed to be totally naked at all times, but all BSC girls not only have killer bods -- the low-fat food and all that daily phys ed they have to do makes sure of that -- but they also have pretty faces.  Lisette's friends, both the naked girls and the clothed guys, sit around the table and she looks up and gabs with them, just like it was nothing.  A sophomore now, she has pretty much gotten over any modesty she had last year.  Sometimes she giggles (I know I shouldn't be admitting this) as I slip a little of that long comb handle into her pussy, making sure no one sees (BSC is a very cool place but any kind of public sex is against the rules), and as she giggles I feel the comb tugging at me with every nuance of her internal muscles, like we're laughing together through her pussy.  I could swear, when she gets excited about something -- like yesterday when everyone was talking about how hard last week's Euro history exam was -- her lower lips move around, opening and closing ever so slightly, like a second mouth talking along with her first one.  Or maybe saying something different, more basic words that we can't hear with our ears.<br><br>I didn't set out to write about Lisette, though I could go on gushing for five pages, but that would be pretty boring to read wouldn't it? I want to get a good grade on this essay.<br><br>Yesterday, as the autumn leaves (or what passes for autumn here in sunny SoCal) were beginning to fall and a green gecko leaf fell onto Lisette's forest and I picked it out and turned to drop it on the ground, I saw HER again.  Grib.  Debbie Grib.<br><br>Walking straight ahead, hard bare feet thudding on the pavement, with her companion Heidi Grau behind her.  It's hard not to see Grib, inventor of the ‶hard nude‶ idea, with her shaved head, and her shaved armpits and shaved pussy.  She does it every day -- using cream, I think -- removes every bit of hair from her body.  She looks like an alien, or some other creature, and makes all the other naked girls look downright clothed and modest.  A pretty alien, of course -- with a hard, wiry body -- but with a hardness to her face.  It seems she's always scowling.<br><br>BSC's nudity policy might sound weird enough to outsiders, but the habits of Grib (everyone refers to her by her last name) are truly bizarre.  I suppose she has a suite room assigned to her somewhere, but she always sleeps outside, on bare concrete, no blankets or pillows.  She bathes outside (usually in one of the creeks behind the dorms) and relieves herself right in front of everyone, facing the passersby as she goes just off the concrete path into the woods, daring everyone to make eye contact.  She far outdoes the ‶Total Nudes‶ or ‶Absolutes‶, those girls who give up makeup, blankets, and jewelry, staying totally uncovered all the time, even off campus and even when classes are out.  She makes them seem like wimps -- which is what she calls them anyway.  ‶Wussy Pussies!‶ is one of her usual taunts as Akeiko and her gang go by.  Which is why she's a problem.<br><br>Actually there's something more than that which I find irritating but at the moment I can't put my finger on it.  Let me list five things that piss me off about Grib:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She taunts the Absolutes (see above), who are a gentle crowd and don't deserve any grief.  I understand (I think) the philosophical difference -- Akeiko stresses being ‶natural‶ and ‶unclothed‶, which is why she thinks keeping all her natural hair is O.K., while Grib stresses total skin exposure.  To us clothed guys, and even to most of the non-Absolute girls, it seems like a silly point of doctrine, certainly nothing to get divisive about.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's just generally prickly and unfriendly.  Not someone you go to when you're looking for a spot in the dining hall and she's at an empty table.  She doesn't go to the usual affairs like campus dances or parties.  She's technically a member of the Ultra Nudity Club, but never participates in any of their functions.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ‶presents‶ when not asked, which is not welcome.  It's one of the basic Blanke Schande rules that any girl must ‶present‶ when asked by a guy -- show whatever body part he wants to see (usually pussy or anus).   It makes the girl oblivious to modesty, and also forces the guys to be polite: he's not allowed to touch and can't make any crude remarks.   In fact a guy asking a girl to ‶present‶ is a way of telling her she's pretty, and most girls take it as a compliment.   But the guy is always the initiator, and most guys like to control when they want to see a girl's private areas.   Grib knows this, of course.  So when she gets up on a table in front of a bunch of guys, turns around and spreads her butt cheeks at us, showing every little wrinkle of her brown asshole, it pisses us off.  ‶Look, men!‶ she says.  What's really aggravating is that she laughs as she shoves her anus into our faces, wiggling her hips, before hopping down and continuing on her way.  At first I thought this might be a form of surrendering her modesty, or maybe tantalizing guys.  Some girls are very aware that in a presenting situation they actually have more power than the guys, and they ‶show‶ more than the guys can really handle, with us not being able to touch or anything.  But then Lisette told me that between the girls here, unasked-for displays of the anus are a ‶p-signal‶ which means about the same as flipping a middle finger.  When she told me this, I said ‶a-ha!‶, my suspicious confirmed.  Grib really was being an asshole, showing her asshole.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She disrupts just about everything she walks into.  Like at Student Assembly meetings where she stands up on chairs in the back, balancing with her toes curled around the tops of the backs, and asks ridiculous confrontational questions.  Last week it was, ‶How can you say you speak for all the students?‶, without identifying what issue she was talking about.  She asks disruptive questions in class too, when she's not being disruptive in other ways, like spreading her feet wide on the seats in front of her and pushing her pussy up, closely examining her bare pussy in full view of everyone, meticulously pulling the lips open, checking out her clit.  One time she actually said to Heidi, ‶My cunt hurts,‶ and Professor Barclay finally told her to close her legs and shut up.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she just shaved her body and slept outside it might be weird but not so bad, maybe admirable in a way if she was quiet about it, choosing such a hard life on principle.  But she's ostentatious about it.  She sleeps on concrete -- in the quad in mid-afternoon.  She shaves her pussy -- right in the middle of the student union, wiping the last traces of the cream from every little crevice.  And she does those damn ‶erotocize‶ exercises, usually reserved for the girls' morning classes, and the usual sit-ups and jumping jacks -- but in the middle of the day, right on the sidewalk.  It's enough to make you roll your eyes, and a lot of people do.<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make that six things.  She smokes.  Some other girls here smoke too, but Grib smokes with such a tough-girl scowl that it almost makes you laugh.  Like she was sucking on the sourest pickle in the world.  Then she throws it down and stamps it out with her tough heel and rubs it into the pavement.  Ugh!<br><br>So why do so many girls find her intriguing? Not that anyone is imitating her, but she has a fascination or a hold on some of them, and I think on many more who are not willing to admit it.  Heidi herself is only halfway to imitating her; she shaves her pussy and armpits but hasn't quite shaved her head -- she's got a short Mohawk.  (Not a surprise, because Heidi is lesbian, though it's anyone's guess what Grib's sexuality is.)<br><br>I've seen a couple of girls bathe in the creek, and sleeping out in the open, on tables or benches, is starting to become a trend.  Or at least you see a lot more of it this year than last year.  And there are more girls shaving their pussies.  Recently I've seen some mushroom cuts that are coming close to being Mohawks.<br><br>So what is the attraction?  Mabye it's just the dare.  A sense of living dangerously, or breaking rules, even though no rules are actually being broken.  It would certainly seem so, considering Akeiko.  Akeiki is very nice, and has been a positive cheerleader for the Absolute cause since she took over as President of the Ultra Nudes last year, but is not exactly a rebel in any other way.  Partly it's her physique -- like a lot of Japanese girls, she has almost no chest and is skinny, seeming like an innocent child.  But mostly it's the way she acts.  She never curses or anything, and acts like a naive virgin a lot.  (She might, in fact, be a virgin.  She has no boyfriend, at least.)  You should see her bed (she lives in Lisette's best friend's suite, and of course in all the girls' suites the bedrooms have no doors).  Her bed is covered with fluffy toy animals, always a red flag if you're trying to get to know a girl.  She's one of the few girls who never uses p-signals (short for ‶pussy-signals‶), those little hand signals involving the genitals that have evolved like a second language that only the girls really understand among themselves.  She's almost unnaturally cheery, like a 12-year-old Mouseketeer.  And then there's Grib.<br><br>It would be easy to dismiss Grib as a rich kid being rebellious, acting like someone who has no bed to sleep on, but I found out she actually is from a working-class background.  A lot of us are really curious about this, and it turns out she gets some financial aid but also supports herself with being ‶an artist's model‶.   Modeling for money is something that BSC females shy away from for some reason.  Maybe it's because they have to be naked all the time and it seems too easy to earn money that way, or tacky somehow.  Grib disappears most nights -- to model.  Or maybe do something else? Someone heard a rumor that she does porn movies in L.A.  It would kind of figure.<br><br>I think I hit upon something in that last paragraph.  Grib acts like she's poor -- no, she acts like she's a prisoner who has to be kept naked and shaved as part of her punishment, forbidden the comforts of a bed or of indoor plumbing.  And making us feel guilty about it.  That's number 7 of what bugs me.  Maybe the main point.  I remember a dream I had once about her.  She was on all fours on a table in the quad, and Heidi Grau was behind her, using a big mallet to pound a huge dildo into Grib's butthole with big roundhouse baseball swings.  Grib was looking ahead at everyone as they passed by, veins popping out in her forehead, teeth gritted, grunting at each new pounding of that huge dildo that must be hurting like hell as it forced open her anal ring and went deep into her gut, angry and determined not to crack at the same time, like a prisoner being tortured, as if to say, ‶F*** you, Warden!  Unhh!  Go ahead, you bastard!  I -- unhh! -- can take anything you can hand out -- unhh!!‶<br><br>It was a very powerful dream, and maybe the girls who are intrigued with Grib have had something of the same dream.  Forced to be naked all the time -- but they agreed to it -- forced to ‶present‶ to any guy who asked -- but the guys can't touch -- being vulnerable and strong at the same time, these conflicting factors must drive any Blanke Schande girl to some weird dreams, and weird desires.  And though it's giving her too much credit to say it was intentional, maybe Grib has tapped into these dreams and desires.  One thing is clear -- she's tough.  Maybe a kind of toughness that a naked girl would like to emulate.<br><br>The only time I ever saw Grib really intimidated was the time she taunted Dan Small.  The sympathies were all on Dan's side, of course.  Everyone likes Dan, a very nice guy, a gentle soul, very quiet, he hardly says two words all day.  He also has the biggest penis on campus.  Not that I'm into guys, but you just can't help seeing that long thick bulge running halfway down to his knee, even through those long baggy shorts he always wears.  Fortunately at BSC everyone is cool about it.<br><br>Except for Grib.  There she was with Heidi Grau, waiting for him to approach with me and a few others on the way to class, and then she hopped on the table and did her butthole thing, looking at Dan's crotch and then his face, saying, ‶Here I am, big boy!‶  I rolled my eyes and Ted seemed about to say something like ‶go away, Grib!‶, but Dan walked right up to her, real calm, looking at her face and then at her anus.  He breathed in, and we all saw as his equipment got harder and even longer, pushing the bottom of his shorts out like a tent pole, threatening to poke out the bottom.  He cleared his throat and said, in his quiet voice, ‶So you want to be touched.  May I -- touch -- you?‶<br><br>There was a long pause as they looked at each other and time seemed to stand still.  Then she quickly said ‶No‶, with a deadpan face, and looked at him some more.  Then she broke the gaze.  She hopped off the table and walked off with Grau.  Dan had one of his little smiles and the three of us went to class.  He'd called her bluff.  Looking for hard anal sex?  Well -- !<br><br>Whatever else you can say about Grib, she's not nuts.  Harry Valentine, who doesn't hide his dislike for her, told her that she would never be able to do ‶hard nudity‶ at the Alturas campus, where there's snow on the ground five months out of the year.  Which was true -- sleeping outside on a subfreezing night would kill anyone, even those weather-toughened Alturas girls.  Grib replied, ‶Yes, but I'm not there, I'm here.‶  In sunny SoCal, where it is indeed possible to sleep outside all year.  Another time, when we came into class from a windy, heavy rain.  More a pain for us guys with our wet clothes than for the girls, for whom it's just basically a shower.  Lisette plopped her wet butt into the plastic seat and I settled down next to her.  Grib sat down alone in front of us and Lisette said to me, ‶rough weather out there‶.  Grib, not turning around, said, ‶Once you sleep on concrete everything else is easy‶.  I rolled my eyes again but I have to admit it's -- Grib has made herself able to handle anything.  There is a weird logic to her habits which is not the thinking of a crazy person.<br><br>Lucky for me, there's clearly an anti-Grib contingent among the girls.  Even with the flood of conflicting mental factors, being prickly and obnoxious is not the only way for a BSC girl to go.  Lisette has been very clear about that.  I was hanging out in her suite the other night with her and her suite-mates -- always a weird feeling, being a clothed guy sitting on the floor (BSC girls tend to be floor-sitters) hanging out with four naked girls who don't seem to remember that they're naked -- and we got to talking about Grib.  Someone mentioned the name, and Marisa opened her legs and worked her pussy lips up and down with each hand, making the other girls laugh.  Seeing I was puzzled -- most guys are with p-signals -- Lisette explained that it literally meant ‶get that pussy fart out‶ but had the sense of ‶what a pain, something to get rid of‶.  (P-signals don't translate very well.) Teresa, sitting like a lot of BSC girls do, cross-legged with fingers entwined in the toes of the opposite foot (a skanky habit but not for BSC girls who are barefoot all the time), said ‶I don't want to join her pity party‶.  Shanelle said, ‶If she wants to be in ‘Prisoner of Cell Block H', that's her business.  Just not on my time.‶<br><br>Lisette, lying back in my arms, languidly stretched her foot out to Teresa, who clasped her toes.  Shanelle scratched one of her big black nipples.  Marisa lay on her side, resting her head on Lisette's flat tummy.  As Lisette flexed her foot back and forth in Teresa's cradling hand, she said, ‶I don't like her being in everyone's face, but I'm not going to let it ruin my life.‶  ‶Amen.‶  That last comment was mine.  It was like a light going on over my head, turned on by Lisette, who is smart and wise as well as beautiful.<br><br>Well that's it.  I know this was supposed to be a short assignment, write about someone you know, and this was probably more than you asked for.  Also I didn't change the name like the assignment sheet said (though ‶Grib‶ seems so apt for this strange girl, and even if I did change the name you would know who I was talking about anyway).  But once I started to write, I just couldn't stop.  I'm glad I got it all out.  I feel better now about this weird girl.  Maybe at some level I'm attracted to her, but she was bugging me and now that I look back on my written thoughts, like Lisette I can accept her (even if she doesn't accept the rest of us).<br><br>Ahhh, life is good.  Now I can go back to really enjoying it the next time I comb Lisette's pubic hair on that table on the quad." },
      { title: "The End of Blanke Schande", summary: "a Blanke Schande story", content: "[Blanke Schande is a college where female students are required to be naked at all times, which research has found turns out better adjusted males and stronger, more self-assured females.  It has a main campus in south California.  It has a satellite campus in Alturas, in the far northeastern part of the state, where there is snow on the ground from October to April, but where the rule of female nudity still applies.]<br><r>‶Oops,‶ Sara said, her breath a little cloud in front of her, as the tiny pea-sized snowball fell from between Shelly's fourth and fifth toes, the new polish on the fourth toe glistening in the bright March sun.  Sitting cross-legged on the soft damp snowy ground, Sara put the little brush back into the bottle and with busy fingers balled up another toe separator, her big tanned boobs swaying slowly as they hung in front of her, huge brown nipples erect like all female nipples were for most of the school year at BSC-Alturas.<br><r>Sitting at the concrete table, Hank, Ahmad and Corey looked on as Shelly sat in the snow, her back towards them, leaning against the bottom of the concrete chair, turning her foot this way and that appraisingly.<br><r>‶Looks very nice,‶ Ahmad said as Sara began the challenge of continuing the sunburst design on the little toe nail.  Shelly was shy and invited encouragement.  It was a wonder that she had applied up here to the Alturas campus, but now that she was in her second semester and paired up with Scott, who had been a rather obnoxious virgin, they both seemed a lot more at ease.<br><r>‶Another fine day,‶ said Corey, shielding his eyes from the glare of the snow on the field up in front of them, the wide open expanse on the edge of campus in front of the redwoods in the distance.  They were sitting around after lunch, basically doing nothing until the next class at 2.  He unzipped his jacket and then shifted his butt, which was freezing on the damp concrete.  Corey, again, felt an odd twinge of envy for the girls, required by college rules to be totally naked at all times.  Wet clothes made you colder.  It was actually safer to be like these girls with their bare butts in the snow, having merely wet skin that would dry off and warm up quickly as soon as they got up.  Of course, the girls had been ‶conditioned‶ -- the cryokinesthetics classes, the ‶five-minute chill‶, and all the other things.<br><r>The guys in their coats over heavy flannel shirts, jeans and clumpy boots, and the naked girls sitting in the snow, sat around silently.  ‶Must be almost forty degrees,‶ Hank said.<br><r>Jerry and Bob Eggles and Keroy bounded down the path, passing a soccer ball around with the impressive skill of swift sneakered feet.  Now the three guys spread out into a triangle on the quad, kicking to each other, with some fine headers and knee shots and even a shoulder punch or two.  Sara looked up briefly, to make sure her work on Shelly's toes wouldn't be ruined by an invading soccer ball, but she was protected by the table.<br><r>Responding to Hank, Sara said, ‶Probably fifty in the sun, but see all the ice in the shade, actually it's about thirty,‶ and of course any BSC girl's word on this topic was to be trusted.  Holding the brush in her fingers, she stretched, her huge breasts jutting out languidly, as she savored every ray of the warm sun on her bare back.<br><r>Ahmad's stomach grumbled.  They all could hear it and chuckled.  Chinese food for lunch; the guys were hungry again, though not the girls, who found themselves stuffing themselves every meal, their bodies' reaction to the demands of an increased metabolism.  The main campus girls were fanatics about keeping their bodies in shape, being that any ounce gained was immediately visible, but after a semester or so at Alturas a girl knew that five or so extra pounds in winter was no shame.  In the dining hall it had been a standing joke, the girls going up to the salad bar four and five times, obeying Nature's call for extra fortification through the cold months, the little tummy pooches, the extra weight on the thighs and boobs.  Nature compensated for it every April as the weather got warmer, when the girls easily sweated the pounds off again.<br><r>Ahmad sighed.  Too bad they couldn't go back to the dining hall.  But Mrs. Magnuson was a stickler for the rules.  You couldn't re-enter for the same meal and that was that.  Also no carrying food out.  Bags had to be left out on the racks, and Mrs. Magnuson had been known to check the pockets in the guys' jackets for contraband such as fruit or a cup of yogurt.  Ahmad took his mind off food by watching the two lovely forms of Alice O'Reilly and Melissa, the girl who loves to climb trees, as they sauntered by the other side of the quad past the shower heads.  They passed by Ellie and Keisha, lounging in the snow, chatting about something.  Ellie, leaning back, stretched her legs out, idly lifting snow with her toes and flinging it sideways.  Alturas girls liked to do that, probably because before they got here it would have seemed so weird and unbelievable.  The possibilities of the human female.<br><r>Hank smiled as his girlfriend approached, tan and lithe and tall and purposeful and serious as always, though with a smile and a nice little wet kiss on the lips for him.  For the tall dark-haired girl with the neat short pony tail it was time for her afternoon sprint.  Wendy Mac was now captain of the track team and had been put in charge of training others.  Two companions in sweat clothes and sneakers clumped along behind her in the wet snow, Tommy Chen, who had just made the team, and that girl Susie, a senior at the local high school.<br><r>‶‘Afternoon,‶ she said to everyone, and then immediately got into the business of stretching and her two pupils followed her lead.  Three right feet, one of them bare, extended onto the edge of the cold concrete, then they switched as muscles and tendons got ready.  Wendy looked at Susie's sneaker and sighed with exasperation.  She didn't have to say it.  Hank had heard Wendy and Susie having that conversation several times before, Wendy trying to get her to run barefoot, stressing the importance of toe thrust, Susie resisting, Wendy saying you don't have to be naked, several famous runners had run barefoot, it's just a matter of toughening the feet, Susie resisting again.  Susie looked up to Wendy, that's why she asked to train with her.  .  .  Hank and Wendy, lying in bed at night in his dorm room, had discussed what might be going on in Susie's mind.  Maybe she was attracted to the naked life but didn't want to admit it.  Or was too intimidated by the prospect.  Perhaps she saw being barefoot as the first step, a ‶gateway drug‶ to the ‶hard stuff‶ of the naked BSC lifestyle which she could not yet face.  Now was the time for Susie to apply to BSC, if she was going to do it.  Just wait and see .  .  .<br><r>The two pupils copied their leader's upward stretch, Wendy in the middle, reaching up to the sun, her body a tall naked ‶X‶, legs apart, toes spread and grasping the clean slush, eyes closed, firm breasts sticking out with nipples pointed and hard in the cold, over the narrow concavity of her tanned tummy and strong back.  Corey took this in and said, ‶You're looking very lovely today, Miss Appleby.‶<br><r>This was a little joke, a reference to Wendy's apple-sized breasts.  Such a compliment was also a standard polite way of asking a girl to ‶present‶.  She smiled.  ‶Why thank you Mr. Soggybottom,‶ she said with deadpan tartness, and she pivoted on one bare foot and extended the other widely, past Corey onto the far edge of the table.  She flexed her pelvis forward and pulled her lower lips apart, revealing the pink inside, then pushed forward again until a dark cave appeared.  ‶Mmmmm .  .  .  ‶  The automatic reaction of any male to such a sight escaped from Corey's mouth without embarrassment at its triteness as he tilted his head to see better.  Ahmad smiled too, as did Hank, who like any BSC guy was flattered whenever his significant other was asked to present.  It was a way of being told, ‶You have a gorgeous girlfriend!‶<br><r>The moment seemed to linger and suddenly Hank and his friends realized that Wendy and her charges were halfway across the field, gathering speed as their muscles got warmer, the tall naked girl clearly more effortlessly than the other two as she paced them.  On the other side of the table Jerry and Bob Eggles and Keroy continued their soccer workout, now getting closer together and focusing on headers.<br><r>Lisa, a thin girl with black hair and glasses, and Sandy, a bleached blond and the oldest of the BSC students, dodged by one side of them and stopped at the table, toting their bookbags.  ‶Hi lover,‶ Lisa said, grabbing Corey's hand as she stood next to him and he glanced down lovingly at her pubic patch so near his face.  ‶That was the worst chow mein I've ever had,‶ Sandy said with her usual frankness.  Sandy was a trip.  35 years old, majoring in biology with an eye to becoming a neurologist someday, she had been a practicing nudist for ten years before applying to Blanke Schande.  The girls never knew what to expect when they went into town with her.  Alturas was kind of a Wild West cowboy town.  The townspeople had learned to live with the occasional naked females from the nearby college, but as BSC girls knew from the orientation sessions and also from their natural instincts, you should be discreet and shouldn't be ‶out loud naked‶ there, like stretching and sticking out your boobs in front of the old guys sitting on the bench on the commons.  But Sandy, not having worn a stitch in so long, usually forgot that she was naked and would do just that kind of thing without being the least bit aware of the scene she was making.<br><r>Ahmad's stomach rumbled again.<br><r>Lisa dropped her bag and got up onto the table.  ‶But -- ‶ Hank was about to mention that nobody had asked her to present.  She anchored her feet wide apart, toes pointing out, then squatted in front of Ahmad and Corey, Corey chuckling as he saw the yellow-green appear between widening pussy lips and then, with a little straining grunt --<br><r>She handed it to Corey, a pear purloined from the dining hall, then stood up and jumped back down onto the soft snow.  Corey sniffed the pear with a smile.  ‶Thanks, Babe.  .  .  Though I think Ahmad would need this more than me.‶  He went out to the untouched snow under a nearby tree and wiped the pear off and returned.<br><r>Ahmad hesitated a little but his stomach decided for him.  ‶Thanks,‶ he said, munching.<br><r>‶Who wants gum?‶ Sandy said in the singsong of an old TV commercial that only she was old enough to remember.  She flung a leg onto the table and extracted a small apple from her lower lips.  It was grabbed by Hank, who nibbled it gratefully.<br><r>Ahmad had already wolfed down the pear and thrown the stem into the snow under the tree.  ‶You girls amaze me,‶ he said, not for the first time.<br><r>‶I can't complain about the taste,‶ Hank said between munches.  ‶Next I wonder if you'll carry a banana.‶<br><r>‶You'll know that, if we're trying to hold back orgasms as we walk,‶ Sandy said.<br><r>‶Actually, bananas slip out,‶ Lisa said.  ‶We've tried.‶<br><r>Lisa and Sandy, bucking the snow-sitting habits of BSC girls, sat cross-legged on the seats across the table across from the guys.  It was actually quite warm in the sun and Hank and Ahmad slipped off their jackets, sitting this winter day outside in their flannel shirts.  After a few moments, Sandy said, ‶Janeane says that you can carry a banana in the rectum, if you're careful, because the sphincter holds it in.‶  Then she said, ‶She says you can carry a lot in there, fruit, vegetables, anything without a sharp edge.‶<br><r>Hank started chewing more slowly, with growing mock distaste.<br><r>‶You might think there's a danger with fecal matter, but she and Jean say that they can tell when their rectum is empty and nothing is about to enter it.‶<br><r>Lisa, continuing this abuse of Hank, added, ‶I suppose you can become sensitive to what's in your lower colon.‶<br><r>Hank coughed and put the apple down, looking at it as if to inspect it for brown specks.  ‶Real appetizing.‶<br><r>What's college without gross-out humor? Everyone laughed and Hank got back to his apple.  Of course BSC girls kept themselves scrupulously clean, inside as well as out; every toilet in their dorms had two attachments, one that gave a kind of douche, the other a kind of enema.<br><r>Lisa got up and ran out next to Jerry, motioning to get a turn, and kicked a few to Keroy and then got a couple of headers in.  She had been on the soccer team in high school and was still quite good, even after making allowance for kicking with bare feet.  She got in a high kick, her toes over her head, her spread pussy lips red and flushed with the cold and with her exertions.<br><r>After that little workout she said bye as the three athletes went along down the path, still passing the ball.  She went back to the table, still panting a bit, and brought a folder out from her bag.  Corey exhaled as if in exasperation.  Hank and Ahmad, still munching, looked at it warily.  As she opened it Sandy looked at the guys quizzically.<br><r>Professor Tereshkova, the Body Awareness teacher, walked by in her parka and leggings and furry boots, waving to the students with her little crooked smile, then walked on toward the faculty building with her slight but recognizable limp.<br><r>This reminded everyone.  ‶That was brutal this morning,‶ Corey said.  The other guys agreed.<br><r>‶Ooohh!‶ Lisa said with a theatrical shudder, thinking back.  Body Movement Class, a.k.a.  ‶Eroticize‶ class, the required morning class for BSC females, under Tereshkova's direction, 30 minutes starting at 8 a.m., during which the girls practiced aerobics, then the various ‶presenting‶ positions.  Of course it was all out in the open; at the main campus, it was in the middle of the big sunny quad next to the palm trees so that the girls were on full public display and anyone could stop and look.  Here at Alturas, on really cold mornings the good professor held it inside, in the gym.  Wherever it was, the guys were naturally attracted to it and could not help from looking, no matter how long they'd been at Blanke Schande, no matter how much you told yourself you'd gotten used to the sight.<br><r>This morning had been overcast, well below freezing -- 20 degrees Fahrenheit according to the thermometer outside one of the dorms -- and windy.  And the professor brought the girls outside! The girls tried to protest but in seconds found themselves doing stiff jumping jacks on the icy platform, trying not to slip with their bare feet.  The aerobics were not so bad, the vigorous muscles heating up despite the bitingly freezing ocean of air in which they were immersed.  But then to hold still for the presenting positions! Around the platform, guys stood in their heavy coats, clouds of breath in front of them, not being able to resist watching with a mixture of lust and horror and pity and amusement as the fully-clothed professor walked around, checking out the hands spreading buttocks apart as the icy wind bit into each exposed anus, curled its way between each pair of pulled-apart vaginal lips, while the girls squealed in protest .  .  .<br><r>It was good natured squealing.  The girls knew they were in capable hands.  They envied Elena Tereshkova in her warm furs and boots but she had earned it.  It was an open secret -- she was a survivor of Blanksk Shchandiy Oblast.<br><r>‶It was a Soviet experiment,‶ was the way Lisa had learned it last year, from Terry, a senior about to graduate.  The six nude females were munching on pine berries as they sat cross-legged around a fire out on the ridge that warm night, on their ‶camping trip‶, a special modular course during which they lived out in the wild for five days, taking nothing with them but their own nude bodies, sleeping on the soft pine needles under the stars, eating the wild plants they had learned about, drinking and bathing in the cold pure water of the streams.  ‶The Soviets loved experiments, even as the Soviet Union was collapsing.  Sometime around 1977 they heard about Blanke Schande, how it produced exceptionally strong and capable women.  They were having problems attracting women into the professions -- too many of them were getting traditional again and staying housewives -- so the Soviet Ministry of Education decided to imitate BSC.<br><r>‶Of course, being the Soviet Union, they made it compulsory.  Compulsory social engineering, that's what they were all about.  They set up a special ‘Oblast', or administrative district, somewhere east of Moscow, and required all female college students to be naked at all times.  But Russian women tend to be really Puritanical and traditional, so immediately they all dropped out.  So then the minister or whoever it was in charge, decreed that all women from the age of 18 to 30 had to be naked, except if they were going to college, in which case they could put clothes on when they graduated.  That got the women back into class.‶<br><r>‶Boy, that was nuts,‶ Lisa had observed.<br><r>‶I'll say.  Maybe they were desperate.  Like I said, the whole system was collapsing.  Well anyway those Russian winters are cold.  Alturas is nothing.  Imagine going out when it's 40 below!‶<br><r>‶You'd be dead,‶ another girl said.<br><r>‶Not if you run like hell from building to building,‶ Terry said.  ‶And then one day the inevitable happened.  Some girls were staying out in a kind of forest bunkhouse they had and a fire broke out.  They called the fire truck but it broke down on the way -- a typical broken-down Soviet truck -- and the building just collapsed in flames, forcing the girls outside with nothing but some thin blankets to put around them.  By the time help finally arrived they had been stuck outside for almost an hour.  Elena was one of them.  They put her into immersion therapy and it was touch and go.  Finally after two weeks she could get up out of bed.  Others got frozen worse.  Their parents went ballistic and the whole project was quietly shut down soon after.‶<br><r>A horrible story but true.  It was hard to look at Ms. Tereshkova's crooked smile, the slight limp, without an almost overwhelming feeling of respect, for what she had been through and then, after that, deciding on studying cryokinesthetics and leading the girls through erotocize class, even on bitter cold windy mornings.<br><r>When Lisa told Corey this story he had been floored.  A baseball player in high school, who did a lot of reading on the history of baseball, he immediately thought of a homely analogy.  ‶Like Herb Score,‶ he said.<br><r>‶Who?‶<br><r>‶Herb Score.  He was a great pitcher in the 50's, I think, and one day a wicked line drive hit him right in the eye, almost killed him.‶  Lisa cringed.  ‶And he came back.  That's the amazing thing -- to get up there and pitch again after being almost killed, hit in the eye like that.  As soon as he got better he came back, the next year I think, he got back up on the mound and pitched again.  He wasn't the pitcher he was, but he came back, like Tereshkova did .  .  .‶<br><r>‶Uh, right,‶ Lisa said.  She supposed the analogy was kind of apt.<br><r>‶She knows where the edge is,‶ Corey said.<br><r>‶What?‶<br><r>‶Ever read Hunter S.  Thompson's book on the Hell's Angels?‶<br><r>‶Um, no.‶  Corey was full of obscure references this night.<br><r>‶He writes about motorbiking up the Coastal Highway, back before it got all built up, when there was no traffic or lights, taking the curves as fast as possible, getting close to ‘the edge'.  .  .  ‘There's no way to tell where it is because the only ones who know where it is are the ones who have gone over.' That's her.‶<br><r>‶Oh -- hey --‶  Corey had succeeded in putting a comforting thought in Lisa's head: the girls were in no danger fron the cold at Alturas: Tereshkova knows how far one can go, where the ‶edge‶ is.  Some time later Wendy told Lisa and Corey about Tereshkova using the phrase, ‶the limit‶.  It was a bitter cold night and Wendy had been walking down that long roundabout forest path to the back of the dorm with her and with Olga Vashetkovskaya, that junior from Siberia who Tereshkova naturally hung out a lot with.  It was so cold and such a long walk that even Wendy was getting worried.  Looking down at the four white bare feet next to Tereshkova's boots, she had said, ‶Shouldn't we be running? I've been shivering for five minutes.‶  The professor said, ‶Don't you girls worry.  You're nowhere near the limit.  Just get under a hot shower when you get in.‶<br><r>This morning, watching his girlfriend up on the platform, spreading her flushed feet and legs apart for the icy wind, Corey had remembered this story and knew that his girlfriend was perfectly safe, and in fact getting stronger for the effort.<br><r>Now, in the bright snowy afternoon sun, Lisa said, ‶You're right, Corey.  That erotocize clas this morning was brutal.‶  Then she exhaled.  ‶Sometimes I can't believe I signed up for this.  It was almost a Tami moment.‶<br><r>Tami, Tami, Tami .  .  .  The legend of Tami Smithers.  Who knows how the Tami legend started? It had been passed down among BSC girls since nobody knew when, perhaps when BSC was first started in 1970, maybe even before.  Tami Smithers, another naked college girl, but Tami was forced to be naked against her will, something about keeping her scholarship, and was the only one naked, no other naked girls around to comfort her.  The Tami legend had inspired a body of Tami fiction and poetry, written by those girls so inclined, and a number of the guys too.  The library had an archive of them, some of the stories approaching novel length.<br><r>There was a black metal statue in front of the administration building, of a young clothed man and a young naked woman, both looking ahead and striding forward, each carrying a lumberman's ax in one hand (appropriate to this redwood country) and a book in the other -- someone always wrote ‶Tami‶ on the side of the base, near the girl's bare left foot.  It was hard to pin down exactly why the legend had such an allure.  Did BSC girls identify with her? -- how could they? For them, nudity was voluntary! Maybe it was Tami's strength, in surviving such an ordeal.  Strength through nudity.  Their patron saint.<br><r>Sara, having finished Shelly's last toenail, stood up, holding the little bottle, her breasts swaying to and fro.  She wiggled her butt back and forth, flexing her muscles, getting the feeling back after sitting in the snow for twenty minutes.  Shelly spread her toes and shook the little snowballs loose and got up too and hugged her, a rather assertive gesture for her.  ‶Thanks.‶  Shelly looked down and flexed her feet.  ‶Expert job.‶  They went off hand in hand.  Not lesbians.  But BSC females, no matter what their sexual orientation, show a lot of physical affection for each other, right down to cuddling with each other as they go to sleep on the big beds in their doorless dorm rooms.<br><r>Now another couple, trudging up the path that came up from the main gate, Kathy and Willy, two panting grease-smeared 20-year-olds carrying suitcases with grimy hands.  Willy, a tall guy with an attempt at a beard and a sherpa cap, wore junky overalls and a sweatshirt with dark streaks here and there.  Kathy, a thin white girl with an outsized chest, had smears of gunk across her belly, all over her thighs, and criss-crossing her huge boobs which wobbled in front of her as she jerked the suitcases up onto the bench.  ‶What is it with you men!‶ she said to her boyfriend with mock exasperation as she jerked again, the suitcases being so heavy.  ‶All these clothes!‶<br><r>‶Jesus,‶ Hank said to the two newcomers.  ‶What happened to you?‶<br><r>Willy sat down with his honey and caught his breath.  Beads of sweat on his forehead matched similar moistness over her breasts.  ‶A great end to a long weekend with my folks.  My car got a flat tire just as we were getting to the gate.  Not easy to fix.‶<br><r>‶And then when we finally got those lug nuts off and got the tire changed the damn car wouldn't start,‶ Kathy said, pulling her long black hair past her eyes.  ‶We had to push the freaking thing all the way back to Merton's.‶  Merton's Service Station was the last thing you came to before the drive up to the campus gate.<br><r>Corey's eyes widened.  ‶You pushed it all the way to Merton's?  And then carried all this stuff up from there?‶<br><r>Kathy, still catching her breath, nodded.  ‶Pushing that huge Ark-like thing was rough.  My ta-tas almost got crushed.‶  She looked down at her breasts and caressed them, trying without success to cup her huge endowments into each hand, then bent down and playfully kissed one and then the other.  ‶Poor babies!‶<br><r>She sat back and crossed her legs like a man does, one foot up on the other knee, and everyone was treated to the site of her totally black, grimy sole.  ‶Yuck,‶ Lisa said.<br><r>‶I'll say,‶ Kathy said.  ‶Merton's has the greasiest garage floor in the world.  Haven't they heard of Quik-Dry?‶ she said, referring to a gravel-like material used to soak up oil spills.  ‶And they made us wait about three forevers before they told us they had to order parts and we had to leave the car there.‶<br><r>Willy said, with a smile, ‶Well they weren't in a hurry, with what there was to look at.  You could have sat with me in the office with that crabby old cashier.  You didn't have to get right in under the hood with them and point to what was wrong.‶<br><r>‶Once a motorhead, always a motorhead,‶ Kathy said.  She looked down at her black sole and spread her toes.  ‶I can't wait for the sponge.‶  The ‶sponge‶ was the little soapy mat the girls kept in their bathrooms. It was not used as much in winter with the snow keeping their feet clean.<br><r>‶Well let's go,‶ Willy said.  ‶I'll give you a nice scrub-down all over.‶  The two of them jerked the suitcases off the bench and struggled around the bend to the dorm.<br><r>‶It's the least you can do,‶ Kathy said, the snow sucking up the sound of their voices as they turned out of sight.  ‶Tonight I'm on top.‶<br><r>The friends at the table saw them go and then resumed their contemplation of the snow and the sunshine.  Ahmad, having finished his pear, brought his bag up onto the table.  ‶Show us your latest,‶ Lisa said.  Seeing his shy hesitation, she insisted, ‶Come on! I saw you working on something yesterday.‶<br><r>It was a charcoal rendering of a stand of trees, then the quad behind it, the administration building in the distance and the black metal statue, tiny in the distance.  ‶Good perspective,‶ Lisa said.<br><r>‶You're getting better and better,‶ Hank said.  They were too tactful to mention it but drawing in the statue was a breakthrough.  Ahmad still had his inhibitions, the product of an upbringing in conservative Islam, which forbids depictions of the human form as idolatrous.  Secretly he wanted to draw the many naked girls around him, but that day was still quite a ways off.<br><r>And now another unattainable object, Naomi, along with her friends Jason, Maury and Graciela, one white and one brown female approaching with two guys in sweats.  Naomi spoke first with a typical Naomi comment.  ‶Such gorgeous creation all around us.‶<br><r>Naomi was a born-again Christian and one of BSC's several dedicated virgins, who for some reason tended to gravitate to Alturas.  It was hard for some of the students to believe that there was such a thing as a born-again nudist camp but Naomi's family had been members of one, down near Santa Barbara, and she had grown up about as uninhibited about nudity as any BSC student.  To Ahmad she was just gorgeous and made even more so by her virginity and her desire to keep it until marriage.  Could he marry her?  Traditional courtship rituals competed in his mind with ideas that were more distinctly his own, for example interdenominational relationships.  He admired her and loved her.  .  .<br><r>‶You are very beautiful, Miss Naomi,‶ he said, nervously, and of course both of them knew what that meant.<br><r>She smiled and said, ‶You're a sweetheart, Ahmad.  Why don't we do a Bible study in the library later?‶  Ahmad allowed a raised eyebrow to interrupt his admiring gaze.  She smiled, knowing that she and he had differing ideas about the Word of God.<br><r>And now the wind played with the light blonde curls caressing her bare shoulders, making Ahmad almost swoon.<br><r>Not forgetting his polite request, Naomi walked over to him and, seeing his nod, turned around and bent over, again without shame.  She had often said, ‶The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, every part is sanctified‶.  Ahmad felt sublime as the sun glistened on her dewy, lipless vaginal region which nothing had ever penetrated.  The darkish brown hair -- no jokes about ‶natural blondes‶ here, BSC guys were experts on the topic and knew that most girls who have natural blonde head hair really do tend to have darker hair below -- and the tight butt cheeks around it.  Ahmad thought to himself: this is the view Adam had, like Eve looked on the first morning in the Garden of Eden.<br><r>Naomi turned back to face him and he joined her and her friends as they walked off, leaving Corey and Lisa and Hank.  They sat silently.  Far off, in front of the trees, Wendy and Susie and Tommy ran across the field, the last two having a hard time staying even with the naked track star.  Bits of snow flew out behind her (toe thrust!) as she continued what to her was a relaxed pace.<br><r>‶Well gotta go,‶ Hank said, off to sociology class, leaving Corey and Lisa alone.  Corey looked at Lisa with a smile.  Lisa extended her foot under the table and caressed his jeans-covered crotch with her snow-encrusted toes.  Corey exhaled and leaned over and the two lovers gave each other a long kiss.<br><r>They got up and decided to take a little walk, hand in hand, their bags over their shoulders as they went up the hill path up toward the ridge.<br><r>Lisa stopped to take the folder out of her bag once again.  Corey looked at it.  ‶I don't know about signing that petition.‶<br><r>It was what was in Lisa's folder.  ‶I wish you'd come out with it.  I hate to put it this way but, you know you want it.‶<br><r>‶No, I'm not sure about it.‶<br><r>Lisa looked up at the trees, then stopped and leaned back against one, a white birch.  She wiggled her back as if scratching it against the bark.  She dropped her bag to the ground, looking down, tracing in the snow with her big toe, as if signing a name.  ‶Corey .  .  .  Kaminsky.  .  .  Let the guys be naked too.‶<br><r>It was an idea pushed sporadically at BSC, being given new impetus this year by Lisa (who was the Alturas student rep on the Board of Governors) and Wendy.  Wendy was tired of dealing with guys she considered to be weaklings; she thought they needed some strengthening.  Lisa's motive was more altruistic.  Being naked was a benefit for the females in so many ways.  Why not extend that benefit to guys too?<br><r>‶I don't know.  I admit, I'm afraid,‶ Corey said.  ‶It didn't seem to work out when they tried it.‶<br><r>‶Oh, Cor .  .  .‶  The original 1968 - 1969 experiments on campus nudity that had given birth to Blanke Schande -- the students had been taught all about it at orientation.  How men did not react well to being naked, universal nudity caused male acting out, as did male only nudity.  Female only nudity, though, worked like a charm, so long as the females were treated with respect with no non-consensual touching.  The men ended up better adjusted about sex, as did the women, who overcame modesty and body image issues to end up strong and self-assured.  Lisa and Corey had gone around and around about this, Corey being hesitant, though not being able to disagree with Lisa's assessment that times have changed, intergender relationships are more equal and more individualized now, and the men (and women) of 1970 were not like men are today.<br><r>Corey dropped his bag and put his arms around his girlfriend, brushing his parka against her bare breasts, putting his head on her bare shoulder.  ‶If the guys were naked, on a cold day like today we all would have dicks the size of thimbles.‶<br><r>‶So what?  Look at all the girls with tiny titties.  I used to be worried that my breasts are too small.  Now I don't care, they're part of me.‶<br><r>‶I think your breasts are beautiful.‶<br><r>‶That's because you love me.  It's part of me, my personhood, not just an external.  What about Stacey Peaches?‶ Stacey, an art major, thin as a rail, had no breasts to speak of, just two hard nipples sticking out in the cold, and even they were small.  ‶Some guys have big dicks, some have little ones.  Once you're all naked for a few weeks you won't care.‶<br><r>Corey had to be honest with his girlfriend but couldn't unstick himself from standard male insecurities.  ‶We can't all be Dan Small.‶  Dan was a student at the main campus, the only guy whose penis size was generally known because it was so huge, the bulge running down his baggy shorts visible even though limp.  Was he a virgin? A nice guy, he was so quiet, didn't have a girlfriend -- were the girls afraid of his size?<br><br>Lisa could guess his thoughts.  ‶Will you stop thinking about Dan!? Think about you.  I'm in love with you.  Your penis is beautiful.  .  .  And huge.‶<br><r>Corey laughed.<br><r>‶I'm getting cold.  Let's get going.‶  And she picked up her bag.<br><r>They went over the rise and into the clearing into the glorious view of the ridge, huge and distant, the stand of redwoods going up to the rocky precipice to the right, above the expanse of forest.  The path then wound around to the left, down into a little cove and a bridge over a stream, then up again.<br><r>‶Unhhh!  Unhhh!‶<br><r>Corey and Lisa looked at each other and exhaled in exasperation.  Jane and Janeane were at it again.  As Corey and Lisa turned the bend that led up to the main concourse the two naked lesbians were 69-ing in a snow bank on the side.  Corey and Lisa resisted but finally had to look.  Side by side, a position that is normally uncomfortable, except they had bunched up snow to prop up each head and each bent upper leg.  Flushed toes spreading and clenching, red fingers grabbing each other's butt cheeks, tongues separating each other's lower lips, consumed in the high metabolism of sexual excitement they seemed oblivious to the cold and to any onlookers.<br><r>These two were a big problem.  Public sex was a no-no at BSC like everywhere else.  It was especially bad at BSC because if it ever got out that the naked BSC girls were having sex out in the open, it would ruin the reputation the college had carefully cultivated, confirm people's worst fears, cause an uproar with the local authorities, and probably bring the great experiment to an end.<br><r>‶Nnnn!!  Oh God!  Ohhhh!‶  Janeane was coming, probably not for the first time.  Her cries rang out in the clear winter air, fortunately getting swallowed by the snow before it carried any distance.  Out here the snow was about a foot deep, slowly melting after that big blizzard last week.  Lisa and Corey stopped and looked with mixed emotions.  The Blanke Schande life was designed to abolish female inhibitions.  Straight or bisexual girls could ‶do their business‶ in the guy's room, with a door that could be closed, but lesbian sex was by definition always on view.  And Jane and Janeane had graduated quite naturally from tonguing each other in their doorless room with guys watching, to doing it in front of guys in the laundry room, then out in the woods, ever more in public.<br><r>They should know better.  It was hard to escape the conclusion that their ultimate fantasy, which they were realizing in stages, was to 69 each other to orgasm right in front of the quad with the whole campus watching.  Both Lisa and Corey watched with increasingly unsympathetic gazes.  Now as Janeane climaxed again, her body turning red in her trademark all-over ‶orgasm flush‶, Jane was doing what everyone by now knew was her specialty, spreading Janeane's butt wide and spearing her tongue into Janeane's anus in time with its spasms. ‶Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! .  .  .  Oh!‶<br><r>‶Oh shit,‶ Corey said.  Walking up the concourse was Mr. Joseph Karasik, the BSC Dean for Alturas, with Professor Outler, the geology teacher, serious men in casual suits, talking no doubt about serious things.  Corey and Lisa looked at the spasming couple in the snow, and out of decency waited for Janeane's climax to run its course.  It went on and on as Karasik and Outler approached.  Finally the last spasm -- no! There's another one!<br><r>It was at the very last minute.  Corey whispered loudly, ‶Karasik!!‶  The two naked lesbians got up and scurried into the brush and out of sight like squirrels, their toes kicking up bits of snow behind them.<br><r>Karasik was cordial and unsuspecting.  ‶Hello, Ms. Tornelli, Mr. Kaminsky.  .  .  Lisa, Mr. Landau has to talk to you about next week's meeting.  They want everyone to go down to Olive Beach.‶<br><r>Lisa contained the barest eye-flick toward the woods where Jane and Janeane had recently disappeared, then looked up to the Dean.  ‶What for?‶ Usually to accommodate her and Mr. Landau, the writing instructor who acted as the Alturas faculty rep, the Board of Governors meetings were done by speaker phone.<br><r>‶They want to make a presentation, a lot of documents and a slide show.‶<br><r>‶Oooh, a slide show,‶ Lisa said in gentle sarcasm.  ‶Popcorn too?‶ It was an unspoken triumph of the Blanke Schande ethos that this naked female standing barefoot in the snow could be so self-assured surrounded by two clothed authority figures as well as the clothed Corey.<br><r>Karasik smiled.  ‶Seems odd to me too.  Well, bye.‶  And he and Mr. Outler passed along.<br><r>After they were gone, Corey and Lisa looked into the woods.  The lesbians had completely disappeared.  ‶I don't know why we keep protecting them,‶ Corey said.  ‶Before they get us all in real trouble, somebody should talk to them.‶<br><r>‶They've been talked to, Cor, it was no use,‶ Lisa replied.  She stepped over to the side of the path into deep snow up to her knees and squatted, the bottoms of her butt cheeks staying just clear.  Elbows on her knees, a stream of piss began dribbling out and soon was cutting a yellow hole into the snow.  ‶They just don't see what's wrong.‶  She exhaled and the pee came out faster.  ‶If Karasik sees them, or God forbid the mayor when he visits, it would be The End of Blanke Schande.‶<br><r>She kept peeing as Corey looked down.  Lisa was beautiful no matter what she was doing.  ‶No, if the men were naked too .  .  .  That would be The End of Blanke Schande.  Maybe you should get Haelters involved.‶<br><r>Evelyn Haelters was the guidance counselor and what passed for a disciplinarian at this rugged little campus.  Lisa looked up at her boyfriend as the pee gathered force and then began to subside.  Steam rose up from the yellow hole.  ‶You mean get her to talk to them?‶<br><r>‶She won't mind if she knew you tried with them first.‶<br><r>‶Maybe I should tell them first, that I'm going to tell Haelters.‶  Lisa coaxed the last few dribbles out and then gathered snow from in front of her with her hands and pulled it forward to cover all traces of yellow.  Then she stood up, shaking her muscles all over.  ‶I'm getting cold,‶ she said.  And they got moving again.<br><r>It was while Lisa was lathering up, under one of the standalone shower heads in the middle of the big Student Union lobby, that Mr. Landau came up.  Shower heads were in open areas all over campus, in fact the only place where a girl could wash herself was in full public view, another BSC rule for overcoming modesty.  In the coldest months, of course, the outdoor ones were turned off to prevent freezing pipes.  Here in the lobby there were six shower heads in a little circle, so that no girl could hide behind any other, with a little stand in the center holding soap and a towel drawer next to a hamper.  Once the girl had dried off, she was not allowed to use the towel to cover herself even for a second; the used towels were placed in the hamper, to be emptied nightly by someone from each of the three dorms on a rotating schedule.<br><r>Sandy had just finished drying to Lisa's right and walked off, all flushed and warm, the warmish water having taken the chill off an afternoon outside, which was the reason Lisa was showering too.  As she spoke with Mr. Landau, who was admirably undistracted as she soaped up her breasts and between her legs, Corey came up to wait for her and to listen.  Apparently there was going to be a vote on a proposal for a new outdoor bathhouse for the Olive Beach campus and a new dorm at Alturas, increasing enrollment here from 60 to 100.  Lisa, raising her voice to be heard over the shower, looked Mr. Landau in the eye as she spoke of funding mechanisms and staffing issues, while spreading her legs to get the cloth in between her lower lips.<br><r>Keisha rushed in from the outside, hugging herself, toes encrusted with snow, and could hardly wait as she stood beneath the shower right next to Lisa -- BSC girls tended to shower right next to each other when possible -- and then felt the blessed warmish water coursing over her cornrows and then over her bountiful dark brown curves and her half-frozen feet.<br><r>Colleen Reilly, the Associate Professor of English, walked nakedly by with a bookbag over her shoulder, being waved at by everyone.  ‶Hi Col!‶ Most of the students called her by her first name.  Her red hair and freckled breasts bouncing, she padded happily past the showers and into the bookstore.  32 years old and in her third year at BSC, she was one of the female professors who went around naked in solidarity with the female students.  She had been at Alturas only one year and had scurried around between buildings at first, but was not too proud to do the five-minute chill under student supervision and had now mastered the BSC-Alturas skill of sauntering slowly through the snow on relaxed bare feet as if not bothered by the cold at all.<br><r>Professor Tereshkova clip-clopped by in her boots and acknowledged the two showering girls.  Keisha, passing soap over her tummy, called for her.  ‶Ms. Tereshkova,‶ she said, ‶this shower isn't hot, it's just warm.  It's winter, you know.‶  She brought this up because Tereshkova was in charge of all female nudity adaptations, not only the erotocize classes but the outdoor toilets (i.e., ‶freshening facilities‶), showers, and removing doors from the girls' dorm rooms.<br><r>‶Is intentional, Keishyanova,‶ she said in her Russian accent, distinctive for being affectionate and firm at the same time.  ‶During vinter is no need for hot, makes you sweat too much.  New policy, is good for you.  All girl showers are now max 20 degrees.  For you, that's 68 degrees in Fahrenheit.‶<br><r>Lisa and Keisha stood still, surrounded by Landau and Tereshkova and Corey, water coursing over their nude bodies, jumping off their nipples, arms at their sides with mouths open in protest.  ‶You -- can't.  It's too cold,‶ Lisa said.<br><r>‶Tell me -- do you feel cold now?‶<br><r>Lisa and Keisha looked at each other.  Then they looked behind them.  This little scene had drawn a crowd, looking at the water coursing down their bare backsides.  Lisa looked down at the four wet bare feet and then looked up and said, ‶Well, no, but -- ‶<br><r>‶Perhaps we should turn down the heat in the classes too.  Or the dorms. Too much heat is bad -- your body must adjust to being a tiny bit chilly, it's better that way.  Otherwise you vill sweat and then not sweat and then sweat again.‶<br><r>The girls already had gotten a taste of this, in Professor Donelson's Developmental Psychology class last month, a little class of nine students which happened to be the only class (aside from erotocize) with no guys.  The day had been bitterly cold, practically down to zero, and the girls had zipped around campus like lightning.  The class had gone normally if a bit boringly, Donelson not being the most exciting lecturer in the world.  That he was wearing a heavy sweater went without notice until Tereshkova came in at the end, with the same question.  ‶Are you girls cold?‶  They all shrugged, no.  ‶Well we turned down the temperature in here.  During this whole time it's been‶ -- she looked at the thermostat -- ‶15 degrees.  That's by your Fahrenheit, 59 degrees.‶  The girls were amazed.<br><r>For now, though, Lisa and Keisha were pissed.  They always looked forward to the hot, hot water after freezing their butts off, and did not like it being taken away from them.  They stood motionless in the middle of the crowd, looking at Tereshkova walking away, before resuming their soaping up and rinsing off.<br><r>It was Erendira, the Mexican girl with the beautiful face and the gigantic chocolate nipples, who brought up the big secret at supper.<br><r>They were sitting around at their favorite table, Erendira, Sara, Lisa, Shelly, Corey, Keisha, Ahmad, Wendy, Hank, Naomi, Tommy.  Erendira was going through a microbikini catalog and discussing possibilites with Sara.  It was a frequent activity of BSC girls who wanted to be as naked as possible during the breaks but couldn't, or wouldn't, commit to being ‶Absolutes‶.  Erendira was pointing to an unusual ‶suit‶, a one-piece that consisted of a single string going into the crotch, coming up on the other side, then up to a ringed string around the neck and splitting in front into two strings that went to little circles that clipped onto and covered the nipples.<br><r>‶I couldn't wear that, I hate thongs,‶ Sara said, pushing her tray away and resting her huge breasts on the table.  ‶I feel like I'm sitting on a cheese slicer.‶<br><r>‶That's how you get as close to naked as possible,‶ Erendira said.  ‶At my high school almost all the girls wore thongs.  I got used to them.‶<br><r>‶I'd rather design my own,‶ Sara said, and she did.  Some of the girls were endlessly inventive and shared their designs for various strings and slings that covered the ‶legal minimum‶.<br><r>‶You couldn't wear that in Bakersfield,‶ Lisa said, referring to Sara's home town.  Lisa and Wendy had been collecting local ordinances regarding what was considered indecent exposure.  They had most of the big cities in California and many towns; they had even gotten college credit for their efforts, which were on file at the library.<br><r>At the main campus, with a lot more girls, there was more of a ‶scene‶ as to planning non-semester wear.  There was even a newsletter devoted to passing around designs.  The college was aware of the possibly perverse motivation for this inventiveness -- it might merely spring from a desire to wear clothes, no matter now minimal -- but it was tolerated.  A related activity at the main campus, though possibly with the opposite motivation at heart, was what had become known as ‶Bobbins‶ -- as in, ‶are you a Bobbin?‶  The idea was to plan to ‶wear‶, during college breaks, the most ridiculous objects so as to cover the ‶legally necessary‶ body parts.  The name started when one girl thought up the idea of gluing sewing machine bobbins onto her nipples.  Other innovations were wine corks to cover the vaginal opening, scotch tape used as a thong, and bras made of twine onto which potholders had been sewed.  The idea was to show how ridiculous it was to require certain body parts to be covered -- anything at all would do, so why not have fun with it?  There were even rumors of parties at the main campus where girls would wear these things, a clear violation of BSC policy, but it sounded like a lot of fun.<br><r>It was when the microbikini catalog had been put away and everyone was sipping coffee, that Erendira leaned forward and decided to tell what she knew.  ‶Muy secreto, don't tell,‶ she said.  ‶I hear from the admissions office that this September they're going to accept a girl from Egypt who is allergic to clothes!‶<br><r>‶What?  Allergic to clothes!‶<br><r>‶You're pulling my leg!‶ Hank said.  ‶Come on!  How could she live?‶<br><r>‶Not very well, from what I understand,‶ Erendira said.  ‶They don't know if it's psychological or physical.  Fortunately her family's rich and she has a big property to hide on.  But she hasn't been able to wear anything since she was 14, not even panties.‶<br><r>Everyone sat silently, thinking of this strange girl and what her life must be like.  ‶In an Islamic country,‶ Corey said, ‶that must be rough, with women having to cover up.‶<br><r>‶Not so much Egypt, from what I understand, it's a pretty secular country.  But still .  .  . ‶<br><r>‶What's her name?‶<br><r>‶Basji.  Very sweet girl, very shy.  She doesn't want to come here, she doesn't want to be naked, but it's the only place she can go to college.  Her family wants the best for her.‶<br><r>‶I imagine so!‶ Ahmad said.  ‶She must suffer very much.‶<br><r>‶Sí, she hates being naked, but that's her life.‶<br><r>‶Shades of Tami,‶ Lisa said.  The other girls nodded immediately.<br><r>‶This is amazing,‶ Corey said.  He looked down, thinking.  ‶When she comes here we have to be super-supportive.‶<br><r>‶Which reminds me,‶ Lisa said, suddenly inspired.  To the groans of some she once again got out her folder with the petition.  ‶Whoa, Tommy,‶ Corey said.  Tommy's name was on it, recently added, making a total now of 15 names, 25% of the Alturas student body.  Tommy smiled and shrugged.<br><r>‶I think we should all greet her and throw a welcoming party for her naked,‶ Lisa said.<br><r>‶Um, we already ARE naked,‶ Keisha said.<br><r>‶I mean ALL of us.‶<br><r>The guys looked at each other and then at Lisa.  ‶I'm in!‶ Tommy piped up cheerfully.<br><r>‶Uh .  .  .  uh .  .  . ‶ Corey and Hank and Ahmad didn't know what to do.  Corey cleared his throat and decided to be brave.  ‶I'm in,‶ he said, raising his hand.<br><r>Hank and Ahmad slowly raised their hands too.<br><r>Lisa showed them the petition.  Hank and Ahmad both looked at her as if to say, ‶Don't push us too far!‶ But Corey grabbed the pen attached to the side and scribbled his name right after Tommy's.  Leading to a big mushy kiss from his girlfriend.<br><r>‶O.K. now,‶ Naomi said.  ‶We're in the dining hall.  You can get romantic later.‶<br><r>‶This isn't Jane and Janeane time, is it?‶ Wendy said.  Eyes rolled all around the table.  The two lesbian lovers were at a small table across the dining hall and Hank and Lisa looked back at them discreetly.  Sure enough, while they were eating Janeane was inserting her big toe under the table into Jane's pussy and, judging from Jane's half-closed eyes, diddling her clit too.  Ostensibly trying to hide it but it was obvious to anyone with this angle view.<br><r>Sandy came back from the fruit bar with a pear and a banana and a smile.<br><r>‶You wouldn't dare,‶ Keisha said playfully.<br><r>‶Oh wouldn't I,‶ the 35-year old long-time nudist said.  She handed the pear to Lisa.  Both looked over at the little desk at the top of the stairs; Mrs. Magnuson's attention was elsewhere.<br><r>Corey thought it was just about the sexiest thing he ever saw, watching Lisa shift her butt around and wince as she inhaled and took the smallish pear into her, out of sight under the table.  Then both hands were up on the table and sipping coffee again, winking at Corey.  What mischief.  There was no reason to do this except for the satisfaction of pulling a fast one on Mrs. Magnuson, the girls getting revenge on behalf of the guys who kept on getting their pockets searched.<br><r>Sandy's face betrayed no emotion at all as she invaginated the much bigger banana.  After a minute she sipped her coffee and got up.  ‶So long folks,‶ she said, moving carefully around the table, taking the tray up, trying to walk naturally.  She made it about halfway to the conveyor belt when the banana just fell out of her, plop, just like that, thumping quietly onto the hardwood floor.  Mrs. Magnuson, fortunately, was looking the other way.  Sandy kept walking, not breaking stride, kicking the banana aside with her bare foot, intending to pick it up and eat it later.  Everyone at the table cracked up.  Sandy would be hearing about this for days.<br><r>Corey looked out the window of his room at the full moon on this frigid, still night.  He was dressed in his bathrobe.  That was as far as he got and he knew he was chickening out.  Lisa had asked him to make ‶his big move‶ tonight, going naked with her to Colleen Reilly's little get-together at her apartment in the faculty quarters, just a short walk across campus.  Under the cover of darkness, he wouldn't get caught and charged with indecent exposure, and of course Colleen and everyone at her party would be cool about it.  Colleen, in fact, had even signed the petition.<br><r>Corey was so happy with Lisa, they had a great sex life, he just didn't agree with her that BSC guys were being emasculated and marginalized by having to wear clothes while the girls got to be naked and strong all around them.  But she did have something of a point.  Guys in 1968 were not like guys today, certainly not like him.  Nudity was a benefit to the girls and would probably be a benefit to the guys too if they tried it nowadays.<br><r>They had talked about whether Blanke Schande girls were dominant or submissive.  Having to be naked all the time -- but they agreed to it! Having to present -- but the guys couldn't touch! One might think that the girls, being stripped, would be submissive, bordering on sex slaves, but of course at BSC nothing could be further from the truth.  He had written an essay about it once for class.  So complicated.<br><r>He wandered down his hallway, past Ahmad's room and Hank's, then past the doorless rooms of Shelly and Keisha and Erendira.  Erendira was sitting on her bed, reading her sociology book, legs splayed open in full view, idly tugging on one big nipple, flexing her toes lazily.  So unself-conscious.  And now here was Corey, a typical covered up BSC male.<br><r>Maybe he had been looking at Erendira longer than he thought, but she looked up with a pleasant expression and assumed that he was asking her to ‶present‶.<br><r>Keisha walked past him and said hi.  She always had a smile for him.  As she passed by her high, bare butt cheek brushed his hip.  These halls were so narrow.<br><r>Erendira spread her legs, her large breasts languidly rolling a bit off each side of her chest, and spread her lower lips for Corey.  Corey smiled.  ‶You seem depressed,‶ the voluptuous Hispanic girl said.<br><r>Corey smiled faintly and shrugged.  ‶I'd hate it if I was the one who had to do that.‶<br><r>Erendira looked at him and then turned over onto all fours.  Her firm breasts, like hanging grapefruit, almost touched the bed as she reached back and spread her brown butt cheeks, displaying the asterisk of her anus.  ‶It's nothing, after a while.  It's just me.‶  Keeping this position, she said, ‶You think of the petition your girlfriend has, no?‶<br><r>‶Yes.‶<br><r>‶Maybe you're afraid of being gay, seeing the other guys naked.‶  She shifted so as to get better anchoring and spread her butt wider.<br><r>‶Maybe.‶<br><r>‶Well so what? You know whether you're gay or not.  I think you're not.‶<br><r>Corey looked at her brown eyes, then at her brown asterisk.  She shifted again and to his amazement he saw the anus open to a dark little hole about half an inch across.  ‶Wow,‶ he said.<br><r>‶Go ahead, look closer,‶ Erendira said, as if with pride.  ‶I just learned how to relax this week.  Olga showed me.‶<br><r>‶Well I'm impressed,‶ Corey said.<br><r>‶Like the scent?  Mexican Lily.‶  Blanke Schande females pride themselves on their wide variety of enema formulations.<br><r>Corey smiled.  ‶Very nice.‶  It reminded him of springtime.  ‶So,‶ he said, as he leaned forward and peered into the dark red interior walls of Erendira's empty, recently irrigated rectum.  ‶What should I do?‶<br><r>‶Be brave,‶ she said.<br><r>‶Thanks, it's not easy.‶<br><r>‶Yes I know,‶ said the sympathetic naked girl with the breasts like big hanging grapefruit and the anus that was open to reveal her most inner depths, as if it was her very soul.<br><r>It was quiet and late, about 10 o'clock on a cold mountain Friday night.  Corey looked out the window at the little table out there under the light.  Olga, naked in the frigid air, was chatting in Russian with Tereshkova, both of them smoking those filterless Russian cigarettes, the professor bundled up, clouds coming from their mouths.  Of all the BSC females Olga was the one who tried the most to approach what Tereshkova called ‶the limit‶.  Of course, as she often said, she never would go naked in winter in her native Siberia, but at Alturas her exposures to cold were downright ostentatious, as if to shock people.  Now she threw the cigarette butt down and crushed it with her foot, not a painful act for a BSC female, especially at Alturas.  The soles of Alturas girls were rock hard.  You didn't want to get kicked by one.<br><r>Olga disappeared from view and now she returned with an icicle in her hand, maybe a foot long and an inch thick.  Corey knew what was coming and prepared to cringe.  Olga got up on all fours on the table, then reached back and spread her butt cheeks.  She did her open anus trick.  The professor, cigarette still in her mouth, carefully guided the blunt end of the icicle into the little hole, then slowly pushed in, maybe five or six inches, then held it there.  Olga put her head down on the ice-covered table as if praying -- which would have been quite out of character for her -- and then she began rapid deep breathing as if trying to hyperventilate.  Corey, one of the males who had taken the cryokinesthetics course as an elective, knew what they were doing.  Introducing ice into the rectum, the body's warmest region, was an efficient way of lowering the internal temperature, which prompted the body to fight back by increasing metabolism, ultimately making the body stronger and more resistant.  He knew Tereshkova would carefully hold the icicle in Olga's rectum as it quickly melted to a thin point, then slowly take it out, then Olga would rush inside to take a warm bath.<br><r>He wandered back to his room, which he had left open, and sitting on his bed was Lisa.  He looked at her and down at his robe.  ‶Sorry, I can't.‶  He sat down next to her.<br><r>He felt the need to explain.  ‶For you girls it was a rule when you got here, that you knew you were subjecting yourself to.  Would you have just taken off your clothes if it was just your idea, and not already a college rule?‶<br><r>Lisa put her arm around his shoulder.  ‶I suppose not.‶<br><r>‶Well .  .  .  ‶ Corey looked down at his stockinged feet next to his girlfriend's bare toes.  He cleared his throat.  ‶It will happen.  Someday, soon.  I just have to think about it.  .  .  When Basji shows up, I'll do the naked thing at her welcoming party, with Tommy Chen and Hank and Ahmad.  We'll try to get all the guys here to do it.‶  He looked up sheepishly.  ‶Sorry.‶<br><r>Lisa gave him a long soulful kiss, hugged him with her breasts and her hips, one bare leg snaking around him.  She looked him in the eye.  ‶You're brave to go this far.  I'm proud of you.‶<br><r>Then she was off, away into the cold darkness, the refrozen ice on the path cracking under her scampering bare feet.  Corey smiled.  Maybe one day the guys would be naked too and BSC would be an even better training for the outside world.  He was convinced it wouldn't be The End of Blanke Schande.  The time was just not yet.  Blanke Schande, like life, was such an ongoing adventure." },
      {title: "Taming the Shrew", summary: "A response to The Problem of Grib", content: `I've been a student at Blanke Schande now for a semester or two. I have to admit it's taken some getting used to. Everywhere I look all I see is naked beautiful girls. The erotising classes are the toughest to take. The room it's given in is like a huge fish bowl. Three of the walls are glass. Even the most jaded Seniors stop to look as thirty naked girls practice the classic presenting positions. The teacher is ruthless and expects each girl to perform shamelessly. The girls are all made to hold the poses while the teacher goes around the room and critiques each pose. I swear I don't know who it's more torture for, the girls or the guys who can't tear their eyes off them. I've seen more then a few new Freshmen guys cum in their pants after staring glassy eyed at one of the erotising classes. The girls all look for it and it's almost a rite of passage among the guys. It's happened to every guy here at least once. Yeah it happened to me and it happened in a way I never would've expected...<br><br>My first week here was a tough one. Not only was I constantly hard but I didn't know a soul at the school. I felt like a complete stranger and was having trouble making friends. All the freshmen at Blanke Schande are a mess the first few weeks. The girls are getting used to being naked all the time and the guys spend half their time walking into things and the other half masturbating. I'd given up on masturbation after a few days because it only seemed to make things worse. So when I woke up early that morning with a hard on that wouldn't quit I decided to go for a walk. There was a nice little patch of woods behind the dorms, I thought maybe the morning air would clear my head and let me get back to sleep. So I tossed on some clothes and went outside. The moment I stepped out the door I wished I had taken a sweatshirt though. It was early fall and the mornings were a little chilly. I didn't feel like going back up to my room though so I just dealt with it. I wasn't planning on being out long anyway...<br><br>I love the woods. I do a lot of hiking and walk quietly so I can do some animal watching. I was hoping to catch a deer drinking from the stream or maybe some interesting birds. What I found was something I never expected.<br><br>I had already walked deep into the woods and was making my way down to the stream. I kept down wind and came slowly out from behind some bushes hoping to see some wild life. What I saw was a naked girl! At first I was scared. She was lying naked sprawled out on her back in the grass. There were no signs of a campsite so it looked like someone just dumped a body in the woods. Then I recognized her. It was the infamous Debbie Grib. Grib makes even the ultra nudes look like wimps. Not only is she nude all the time but she shaves off every single hair on her body, has given close up views of her asshole to every student, male or female, whether they've asked for it or not and has been rumored to sleep and bathe outside. I guess those rumors were true. She hadn't heard me so I decided to sneak up a little closer.<br><br>Moving quietly I hid behind a small group of bushes that were a few feet away from her. I could see her clearly now. It was Grib all right and she was sleeping naked in the woods. She was still lying on her back with her legs spread. There truly didn't seem to be a hair on her body. She’d even shaved off her eyebrows! She looked alien and slightly bizarre but somehow I still found her beautiful. Being a female student at Blanke Shcande she was required to take the daily exercise classes. Her body was trim and tight, she had a nice pair of tits and her legs were long and shapely. She actually looked very beautiful lying there sleeping in the early morning light.<br><br>Granted it was some weird other worldly beauty but lying there quietly like that with out any of the attitude she's always throwing in our faces she really looked beautiful to me. I smiled to myself because the truth of it is I always had a thing for strange girls. What can I say? The weirder they are the more I like them. What was really behind her attitude though? I decided to try and find out. Maybe there was a decent person under there after all.<br><br>Suddenly as I traced her naked body with my eyes I realized that she was shivering in her sleep. I don't see how she couldn't be miserable... When I saw her cigarettes and lighter I moved without thinking. Working quietly I gathered small twigs and dead leaves. I placed them in a small pile near her and then went off for slightly larger pieces of wood. In no time I had all I needed for a small regulation Boy Scout campfire. I set up the small circle of stones and then placed the leaves and twigs inside it. I had a close call when I reached for her lighter but luckily she just rolled on her side and stayed asleep.<br><br>I lit the dead leaves and got the small twigs burning. Then I put on the larger pieces of wood. I knew she'd probably wake up as soon as the full fire was lit so I had to get out of there. I didn't want her to mistake my act of kindness for something else. So as the larger branches started to burn I looked up at her to make sure she was still asleep. I watched the firelight play over her naked body and felt my cock throb. I saw that the fire was lit so I stood up, took one last look at Grib and then squeezed my hard cock once before getting out of there. Sure I jerked off when I got back to my room but at least I got back to sleep.<br><br>Later that day I was sitting in class listening to a dull lecture by one of the professors. I was about to drift off to sleep when I caught something out of the corner of my eye. Grib was bent over and had her spread ass pressed up against the window. She waited until most of the class noticed and then laughed and ran off. For some reason I laughed to myself too. I don't think a single student in the class missed seeing her asshole and pussy pressed up against the glass.<br><br>That was normal Grib kind of stuff but a few hours later something strange happened. I needed to kill some time between classes so I went over to the library to do some reading. I found an open spot at one of the tables and sat between a few students and started to read my psychology book when Grib sauntered over. She hopped up on the table and crawled across it on her hands and knees. Then when she reached the other side she put her head down on the table and stuck her ass up at us. She reached behind her and spread her ass cheeks for us and waved her asshole and pussy at us. When we all just stared at her blankly she laughed, sat up cross legged at the head of the table, lit one of her horrible smelling cigarettes and said, "Come on boys that's what you want to see isn't it? Maybe you need a closer look?"<br><br>With the cigarette in her mouth she crawled over to each boy at the table, she sat right in front of him with her legs spread on either side of him and her feet on the edge of the table. Then she thrust her pussy up in the air almost in his face. After giving him a nice long look she sat back down on the edge of the table and put her arms around his neck. Now her tits were square in his face. She whispered something to him and then blew that awful smelling smoke in his face. There were four of us at the table and all we could do is watch and wait our turn. It was like some weird beautiful car wreck that you knew was coming your way but didn't want to avoid.<br><br>Finally she sat down in front of me. Right there in front of me was the infamous Debbie Grib in all her naked alien beauty. I expected her to go right into the routine she had with the two boys before me. She seemed to be hesitating and looking at me oddly. My eyes wandered down from her face to the rest of her body. She really did have beautiful breasts.<br><br>Just then I heard a female voice behind me. "Come on Grib give him a break.<br><br>He's a freshman." I heard a female voice behind me say.<br><br>"Oh yeah? Are a Freshman? I bet you're about to burst. Let's see." Grib said as she reached down between my legs and gave my hard cock a squeeze. It was all I could take. I had been hard off an on for days around hundreds of naked women with little relief. When she touched my cock I came with a little grunt and a tremor. All the time my eyes were locked with Grib's.<br><br>It wasn't an Earth shattering orgasm but it was right there in the middle of the library with six students watching.<br><br>"Nice going Grib. You're a real welcome wagon." The other female student said. Then she continued to me by saying, "Don't worry kid every Freshmen BSC guy cums in his pants at least once."<br><br>Grib and I just kept staring at each other with her hand on my softening cock until I said, "Yeah well I'm gonna go get cleaned up." I moved my chair back and then said, "My books?"<br><br>Grib just planted her feet on the edge of the table and lifted her ass up high enough for me to grab them out from underneath her. Still I couldn't help but look at her pussy as I reached under for my stuff.<br><br>I put my books in front of my crotch and started to walk away. When I did I turned right into the female student that tried to get Grib off my back (or front as it was). She was tall, beautiful and naked as the day she was born. "Really don't let her get to you. It'll be ok." She said with a comforting smile.<br><br>"Thanks," I said. Then I looked back at Grib still sitting on the edge of the table with her legs spread. "It's ok..."<br><br>I left the library and went back to my dorm to clean up and change. As I did I couldn't get the image of Debbi Grib out of my mind. Stark naked, completely exposed, totally hairless and squeezing my hard cock... I know you may not understand it but the whole scene turned me on. Still I was beginning to wonder if there really was anything more to Grib then what she showed us. Maybe this chick was more trouble then she was worth. I put the whole thing out of my head for the moment and went about my day.<br><br>Two classes later I was sitting outside under a tree eating a sandwich. I was reading a chapter from my biology textbook when I felt a shadow fall over me. I looked beyond my book and slowly up the naked body of none other then Debbie Grib. I tried not to let my eyes linger over her shapely legs, hairless pussy and full breasts but I know I must have for a second or two longer then necessary because by the time I looked up at her face she was smiling.<br><br>"What do you want?" I asked. "Come to show me your asshole?"<br><br>She sat down in front of me with her knees bent and her legs spread. She folded her arms over her knees and rested her chin on her clasped hands. Her tits were pressed together and her pussy was completely on display. Since she was shaved and sitting so close I could even see that her lips were slightly parted...<br><br>"Look I'm really sorry about before," she said quietly. "I know I push things pretty far but I wouldn't have done that on purpose to you."<br><br>I looked at her skeptically and asked, "What's so special about me?"<br><br>She looked at me for a second and said, "Aren't you a little curious about what I was whispering to the other guys?"<br><br>"Come on Grib haven't you had enough fun at my expense already?" I asked a little annoyed.<br><br>"I said I was sorry about that and I really meant it." She said sheepishly.<br><br>"Ok..." I sighed, "You're sorry... So what were you whispering?"<br><br>"It was a line from an old Doors song. My older brother used to play it to death... Come on baby light my fire. There's only one person on this campus who'd know what I meant by that."<br><br>We just stared at each other for a minute until she said, "I woke up half way through but I couldn't get a clear view of you. At first I wasn't sure what you were up to especially when you grabbed yourself but then you just walked away... No one has ever done anything just to be nice to me."<br><br>"Well you don't exactly make it easy Grib." I said with a half smile.<br><br>"Please call me Debbie."<br><br>I sighed and then said, "Ok, Debbie."<br><br>"Why did you do it? How did you even find me?" She asked.<br><br>"Completely by accident. I'm kind of a nature boy and was just out for a walk in the woods because I couldn't sleep. Then I came along this beautiful, although pretty weird, girl sleeping naked and shivering in the woods."<br><br>"You think I'm beautiful?" She asked surprised.<br><br>"Yeah, I just wish you weren't such a..."<br><br>"Bitch?" She asked with a smile.<br><br>I laughed and then said, "Well, I wouldn't call you a bitch but you sure as hell make it hard to like you. Why put yourself through all this and push everyone away?"<br><br>"I guess it's just how I deal with it that's all..." She said eyes looking downward.<br><br>"All the other girls seem to take a lot of, comfort, in each other."<br><br>"Yeah, well I don't eat pussy, okay?" She said with a twisted expression.<br><br>"Easy, no one was asking you to. In fact I was sorta hoping you liked guys. I just thought that maybe if you made friends with a couple of the girls you wouldn't feel so alone."<br><br>"I've never made friends easily. Never really cared about that until I met you..." She said looking at me with big, almost watery, eyes.<br><br>I thought about it for a second and then said, "Will you give up those awful cigarettes?"<br><br>She smiled at me and asked, "Can I keep the lighter?"<br><br>"Yeah," I smiled back at her.<br><br>I think Debbie and I spent just about every free hour together after that. We got a lot of strange looks walking around campus. Debbie stopped being so obnoxious to everyone who came near her but I could see people were still skeptical. I told her to be patient and ignore them. They'd see her like I did eventually and things would get better. Right there in the middle of campus she threw her arms around me, pulled me up against her tighter then a vice and kissed me like I'd never been kissed before. Funny thing is I think that was harder for her to do then being naked in public.<br><br>After she came up for air I smiled at her and said, "You trying to make me cum in my pants again?"<br><br>"Trust me," She said with a devilish grin, "Next time I make you cum it won't be in your pants."<br><br>Then she kissed me again and I almost made a liar out of her.`}
